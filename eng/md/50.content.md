--------------------------------

## Philippians 1:1 (id: 23060)

* Timothy was one of Paul's most trusted co\-workers and messengers. Paul lists Timothy as a co\-sender for five other letters:

    + 2 Corinthians
        + Colossians
        + 1 Thessalonians
        + 2 Thessalonians
        + Philemon
* *servants of Christ Jesus*: Paul and Timothy belonged entirely to Christ and were fully devoted to his service (see [Philippians 2:20–21](https://ref.ly/Phil2:20-Phil2:21)).
* God's holy people are made holy in God's sight by Christ's redeeming work (see [Ephesians 1:4](https://ref.ly/Eph1:4), [7](https://ref.ly/Eph1:7); [5:25–27](https://ref.ly/Eph5:25-Eph5:27); [Colossians 1:22](https://ref.ly/Col1:22)). They are being made holy by the transforming work of the Holy Spirit in their lives (compare [Philippians 4:21](https://ref.ly/Phil4:21)).
* Philippi was a Roman colony in the province of Macedonia. The church in Philippi was the first Christian community in Greece (see [Acts 16:11–40](https://ref.ly/Acts16:11-Acts16:40)).
* In the early church, church leaders provided spiritual guidance, while deacons attended to practical matters (see [1 Timothy 3:1–13](https://ref.ly/1Tim3:1-1Tim3:13)). There were no professional pastors or priests like there are today (compare [1 Corinthians 14:26–31](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:26-1Cor14:31)).

## Philippians 1:1–2 (id: 23052)

Paul begins his letter by listing the senders and recipients. He then offers a blessing of grace and peace.

* **Associated Passages:** PHP 1:1–PHP 1:2

## Philippians 1:2 (id: 23068)

Grace is the kindness and blessing God gives, even though people do not deserve it. Peace means deep well\-being and calmness that come from the good news about Jesus and are produced by the Holy Spirit (see [Galatians 5:22](https://ref.ly/Gal5:22)). Both grace and peace are gifts from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ (see [Romans 5:1–2](https://ref.ly/Rom5:1-Rom5:2)).

* **Associated Passages:** PHP 1:2

## Philippians 1:3–11 (id: 23069)

Paul thanks God for the recipients and prays for them. This is Paul's usual practice when writing letters.

* **Associated Passages:** PHP 1:3–PHP 1:11

## Philippians 1:4–6 (id: 23071)

Paul felt joy because the Philippians partnered with him to spread the good news about Jesus. Paul was confident that God would continue his good work in them.

* **Associated Passages:** PHP 1:4–PHP 1:6

## Philippians 1:5 (id: 23072)

Their partnership also included giving money to help Paul in his work (refer to [4:10–20](https://ref.ly/Phil4:10-Phil4:20)).

Because God is the one who began it, we can trust that God will continue changing believers to become more like his Son (see [Romans 8:29](https://ref.ly/Rom8:29); [Ephesians 4:13](https://ref.ly/Eph4:13), [15](https://ref.ly/Eph4:15)).

## Philippians 1:7 (id: 23074)

*It is right for me to feel this way about all of you, since I have you in my heart*: Perhaps their lives were blessed because of Paul’s suffering and witness. Perhaps they had suffered together with him (see [1:29](https://ref.ly/Phil1:29)).

* **Associated Passages:** PHP 1:7

## Philippians 1:9–10 (id: 23075)

* Love is the result of Christ’s Spirit within believers ([Romans 5:5](https://ref.ly/Rom5:5); [Galatians 5:22](https://ref.ly/Gal5:22)). Love is part of the fruit of the Spirit. The fruit of the Spirit is the evidence that Christ is working in believers
* *abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insigh*t: Growing in understanding helps believers know what truly matters (see [Romans 12:2](https://ref.ly/Rom12:2)). It helps them live pure and blameless lives until Christ returns (compare [1 Thessalonians 3:12–13](https://ref.ly/1Thess3:12-1Thess3:13); [5:23](https://ref.ly/1Thess5:23)).

* **Associated Passages:** PHP 1:9–PHP 1:10

## Philippians 1:11 (id: 23053)

* People cannot create righteous character on their own; it only comes through the Spirit of Christ working in their hearts.
* The ultimate purpose for God's people is to give glory and praise to God (see [Ephesians 1:6](https://ref.ly/Eph1:6), [12](https://ref.ly/Eph1:12), [14](https://ref.ly/Eph1:14)).

* **Associated Passages:** PHP 1:11

* **Associated Passages:** PHP 1:13

## Philippians 1:14 (id: 23057)

Because of Paul's courage and boldness, the believers (literally *the brothers in the Lord;* see study note on 1:12) became more daring and less fearful in sharing God's message. Paul's boldness spread to others.

* **Associated Articles:** Philippians 1:12 (ID: `23055@TyndaleStudyNotes`)

## Philippians 1:15–18 (id: 23058)

*some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry*: These people were likely other believers who did not like Paul and criticized him (see [2 Corinthians 10–13](https://ref.ly/2Cor10:1-2Cor13:14); [Galatians 4:12–20](https://ref.ly/Gal4:12-Gal4:20); [5:7–12](https://ref.ly/Gal5:7-Gal5:12)). Even so, the message about Christ was being preached, so Paul rejoiced.

* **Associated Passages:** PHP 1:15–PHP 1:18

## Philippians 1:19 (id: 23059)

*will turn out for my deliverance*: Paul expected to be released from prison soon (see [1:25–26](https://ref.ly/Phil1:25-Phil1:26); [2:24](https://ref.ly/Phil2:24)). This is different from what Paul wrote later in [2 Timothy 4:6](https://ref.ly/2Tim4:6), when he was in prison again and expected to die.

* **Associated Passages:** PHP 1:19

## Philippians 1:21 (id: 23061)

*to die is gain*: For believers, death is not something to fear. It means going to be with Christ (see [1:23](https://ref.ly/Phil1:23); compare [John 5:24](https://ref.ly/John5:24); [11:25–26](https://ref.ly/John11:25-John11:26); [Romans 8:38–39](https://ref.ly/Rom8:38-Rom8:39)).

* **Associated Passages:** PHP 1:21

## Philippians 1:23 (id: 23062)

*I desire to depart and be with Christ:* Death leads believers immediately into the Lord’s presence (see [3:20–21](https://ref.ly/Phil3:20-Phil3:21); [1 Corinthians 15:20–23](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:20-1Cor15:23), [51–52](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:51-1Cor15:52); [2 Corinthians 5:1–8](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:1-2Cor5:8); [1 Thessalonians 4:13–17](https://ref.ly/1Thess4:13-1Thess4:17)).

## Philippians 1:25 (id: 23063)

* The well\-being of the church is more important to Paul than his own desire to be with Christ.
* *for your progress and joy in the faith*: Christians should find joy even during tough times (see [4:4](https://ref.ly/Phil4:4); [John 15:11](https://ref.ly/John15:11), [20](https://ref.ly/John15:20); [16:20–24](https://ref.ly/John16:20-John16:24); [1 Thessalonians 5:16](https://ref.ly/1Thess5:16)).

* **Associated Passages:** PHP 1:25

## Philippians 1:27 (id: 23065)

As foreigners in this world, the Philippian believers should live like citizens of heaven (compare [3:20](https://ref.ly/Phil3:20); [1 Peter 2:9–11](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:9-1Pet2:11)).

* **Associated Passages:** PHP 1:27

## Philippians 1:27–30 (id: 23064)

Paul encourages the Christians in Philippi to live in a way that honors the gospel (see [Ephesians 4:1](https://ref.ly/Eph4:1); [Colossians 1:10](https://ref.ly/Col1:10); [1 Thessalonians 2:12](https://ref.ly/1Thess2:12)). He especially encourages them to stay strong and faithful, even when they face persecution.

* **Associated Passages:** PHP 1:27–PHP 1:30

## Philippians 1:28 (id: 23066)

* *This is a clear sign of their destruction but of your salvation*: As translated, the persecutors would feel convicted by the example of the Philippians. The same Greek phrase could also mean *a sign to them that you are going to be destroyed, but a sign to you that you are going to be saved.* By that interpretation, the persecutors would stay blind to the truth (compare [2 Corinthians 2:15–16](https://ref.ly/2Cor2:15-2Cor2:16)).

* **Associated Passages:** PHP 1:28

## Philippians 1:29 (id: 23067)

* **Associated Passages:** PHP 1:30

## Philippians 2:1–2 (id: 23077)

*If any ...?* These are rhetorical questions that expect a “yes” answer. Paul is saying that if people have truly experienced Christ, they should live together with love, unity, and care for one another.

* **Associated Passages:** PHP 2:1–PHP 2:2

## Philippians 2:1–11 (id: 23076)

* **Associated Passages:** PHP 2:1–PHP 2:11

## Philippians 2:3–4 (id: 23092)

*Do nothing out of selfish ambition*: Thinking only about yourself is the opposite of truly caring for others (compare [2:20–21](https://ref.ly/Phil2:20-Phil2:21); [1 Corinthians 10:24](https://ref.ly/1Cor10:24); [Galatians 5:26](https://ref.ly/Gal5:26)).

* **Associated Passages:** PHP 2:3–PHP 2:4

* **Associated Passages:** PHP 2:6

## Philippians 2:6–11 (id: 23093)

This early Christian hymn is about:

* Christ’s divine nature and existence before the world began,
* Christ's coming to earth as a human and dying, and
* Christ's exaltation and role as Lord over all.

* **Associated Passages:** PHP 2:6–PHP 2:11

## Philippians 2:7 (id: 23095)

* *he emptied himself*: He gave up his divine privileges and chose to live as a human. The rest of verses [7–8](https://ref.ly/Phil2:7-Phil2:8) explains this ultimate act of godly self\-giving love (compare [2 Corinthians 8:9](https://ref.ly/2Cor8:9)).
* *taking the form of a servant*: Paul might have been thinking of [Isaiah 52:13–53:12](https://ref.ly/Isa52:13-Isa53:12).
* *being made in human likeness*: Jesus became truly human while still being God (see [John 1:14](https://ref.ly/John1:14); [1 Timothy 3:16](https://ref.ly/1Tim3:16)).

* **Associated Passages:** PHP 2:7

## Philippians 2:8 (id: 23096)

* *He humbled Himself and became obedient to death*: Jesus obeyed God’s will by dying for the sins of humanity (see [Isaiah 53:7](https://ref.ly/Isa53:7); [Matthew 26:39](https://ref.ly/Matt26:39); [John 3:16](https://ref.ly/John3:16); [10:17–18](https://ref.ly/John10:17-John10:18); [Romans 5:8](https://ref.ly/Rom5:8), [19](https://ref.ly/Rom5:19); [8:3](https://ref.ly/Rom8:3); [Hebrews 5:8](https://ref.ly/Heb5:8); [1 John 4:9–10](https://ref.ly/1John4:9-1John4:10), [14](https://ref.ly/1John4:14)).
* *even death on a cross*: Death on a cross was a death specifically for criminals. In the Roman Empire, crucifixion was a cruel and humiliating punishment for criminals.

* **Associated Passages:** PHP 2:8

## Philippians 2:9 (id: 23097)

* *Therefore*: Because of Christ's humble obedience, God raised him to the place of highest honor (see [Acts 1:9–10](https://ref.ly/Acts1:9-Acts1:10); compare [Acts 2:32–33](https://ref.ly/Acts2:32-Acts2:33); [7:55–56](https://ref.ly/Acts7:55-Acts7:56)).
* *gave Him the name above all names*: Jesus has supreme authority and power ([Philippians 2:10–11](https://ref.ly/Phil2:10-Phil2:11); compare [Matthew 28:18](https://ref.ly/Matt28:18); [John 17:5](https://ref.ly/John17:5); [Acts 2:33–36](https://ref.ly/Acts2:33-Acts2:36); [Hebrews 2:9](https://ref.ly/Heb2:9); [12:2](https://ref.ly/Heb12:2)).

* **Associated Passages:** PHP 2:9

## Philippians 2:10–11 (id: 23078)

* *in heaven and on earth and under the earth*: All of creation, including spiritual powers, angels, humans on earth, and those who have died, will one day acknowledge Jesus Christ's authority as Lord (see [Ephesians 1:9–10](https://ref.ly/Eph1:9-Eph1:10), [21](https://ref.ly/Eph1:21); [Colossians 1:20–25](https://ref.ly/Col1:20-Col1:25); [1 Peter 3:22](https://ref.ly/1Pet3:22)).
* *every tongue confess* (compare [Isaiah 45:23](https://ref.ly/Isa45:23); [Romans 14:11](https://ref.ly/Rom14:11)): This does not mean everyone will be saved. Not everyone will confess Jesus as Lord willingly out of love and devotion.
* *Jesus Christ is Lord*: God's personal name in the Old Testament, *Yahweh*, was considered too holy to say aloud. So Jewish people would say *Adonai* (which means “Lord”) instead. When the Old Testament was translated into Greek, *Yahweh* was represented by the Greek word *kurios* (“Lord”). This same title is often used for Jesus in the New Testament.

* **Associated Passages:** PHP 2:10–PHP 2:11

## Philippians 2:12 (id: 23080)

*as you have always obeyed* (see [John 3:36](https://ref.ly/John3:36); [Romans 1:5](https://ref.ly/Rom1:5)): Believers must consider God's judgment like everyone else (compare [1 Corinthians 3:10–13](https://ref.ly/1Cor3:10-1Cor3:13)).

* **Associated Passages:** PHP 2:12

## Philippians 2:12–18 (id: 23079)

Paul encourages believers to stay strong in their faith and live lives of obedience and purity, following Christ's example.

* **Associated Passages:** PHP 2:12–PHP 2:18

## Philippians 2:13 (id: 23081)

*For it is God who works in you*: God gives believers the strength and energy to live their lives (see [John 15:5](https://ref.ly/John15:5); [1 Corinthians 12:6](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:6); [15:10](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:10); [2 Corinthians 3:5](https://ref.ly/2Cor3:5); [1 Thessalonians 2:13](https://ref.ly/1Thess2:13)). The desire and ability to do what pleases God come from God.

* **Associated Passages:** PHP 2:13

## Philippians 2:14 (id: 23082)

Complaining and arguing come from thinking only about yourself (see [1 Corinthians 10:10](https://ref.ly/1Cor10:10); [1 Peter 4:9](https://ref.ly/1Pet4:9); [Jude 1:16](https://ref.ly/Jude1:16)).

* **Associated Passages:** PHP 2:14

## Philippians 2:15 (id: 23083)

* *you shine as lights in the world*: Believers should attract others to God through their actions (see [Matthew 5:13–16](https://ref.ly/Matt5:13-Matt5:16)).

* **Associated Passages:** PHP 2:15

## Philippians 2:16 (id: 23084)

* *hold forth the word of life*: Believers must keep trusting in the good news about Jesus, which gives life. God is faithful, but believers must also remain faithful ([1:6](https://ref.ly/Phil1:6); [2:12–13](https://ref.ly/Phil2:12-Phil2:13)).
* *that I did not run or labor in vain*: Paul often compares the Christian life to running a race or training for a competition (see [3:12–14](https://ref.ly/Phil3:12-Phil3:14); [1 Corinthians 9:24](https://ref.ly/1Cor9:24), [26](https://ref.ly/1Cor9:26); [Galatians 2:2](https://ref.ly/Gal2:2); [5:7](https://ref.ly/Gal5:7); [2 Timothy 4:7](https://ref.ly/2Tim4:7)).

* **Associated Passages:** PHP 2:16

## Philippians 2:17–18 (id: 23085)

* *even if I am being poured out like a drink offering … I am glad and rejoice*: In both Jewish and pagan traditions, people would pour out wine on a sacrifice or at the altar to honor their god. Paul uses this image to say that his whole life is like an offering to God (compare [Romans 12:1](https://ref.ly/Rom12:1); [15:16](https://ref.ly/Rom15:16)).
* Faithful service brings joy because nothing done for God is wasted (see [1 Corinthians 15:58](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:58)).

* **Associated Passages:** PHP 2:17–PHP 2:18

## Philippians 2:19–24 (id: 23086)

Paul praises Timothy, whome he hopes to send to the Philippians in the near future. Timothy traveled with Paul on his first trip to Philippi (see [Acts 16:1–3](https://ref.ly/Acts16:1-Acts16:3), [12](https://ref.ly/Acts16:12); [17:15](https://ref.ly/Acts17:15); [18:5](https://ref.ly/Acts18:5); compare [Acts 19:22](https://ref.ly/Acts19:22)).

* **Associated Passages:** PHP 2:24

## Philippians 2:25–30 (id: 23089)

* Paul praises Epaphroditus, a messenger from the church at Philippi (see also [4:18](https://ref.ly/Phil4:18)). Paul is now sending Epaphroditus back to Philippi, perhaps with this letter.
* Paul describes Epaphroditus as his *fellow soldier*. This suggests the challenges, opposition, and dangers faced in Christ's work.

* **Associated Passages:** PHP 2:25–PHP 2:30

## Philippians 2:27 (id: 23090)

Paul believed God showed mercy by helping Epaphroditus recover from a serious illness. This mercy also helped Paul, who was already suffering in prison.

* **Associated Passages:** PHP 2:27

## Philippians 2:29–30 (id: 23091)

Epaphroditus deserved their honor because he risked his life for Christ on their behalf (for the importance of showing honor, compare [Romans 10:12](https://ref.ly/Rom10:12); [13:7](https://ref.ly/Rom13:7); [Ephesians 5:33](https://ref.ly/Eph5:33); [6:2](https://ref.ly/Eph6:2); [1 Timothy 5:17](https://ref.ly/1Tim5:17); [6:1](https://ref.ly/1Tim6:1); [1 Peter 2:17](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:17); [3:7](https://ref.ly/1Pet3:7)).

* **Associated Passages:** PHP 2:29–PHP 2:30

## Philippians 3:1 (id: 23107)

* *rejoice in the Lord*: This theme appears again in [4:4](https://ref.ly/Phil4:4) (see also [1:18](https://ref.ly/Phil1:18); [2:17–18](https://ref.ly/Phil2:17-Phil2:18), [28](https://ref.ly/Phil2:28); [4:10](https://ref.ly/Phil4:10)).
* *the same things: T*he meaning here is unclear. It might refer to:

    1. the recent encouragement to rejoice in the Lord;
        2. the earlier advice to follow Christ’s example ([2:1–18](https://ref.ly/Phil2:1-Phil2:18));
        3. Paul’s encouragement in general; or
        4. the upcoming warning about threats to their faith.

* **Associated Passages:** PHP 3:1

## Philippians 3:2 (id: 23111)

*those dogs, those workers of evil*: Here, Paul reverses the traditional Jewish practice of calling non\-Jewish people *dogs* (see [Mark 7:27–28](https://ref.ly/Mark7:27-Mark7:28)). Paul directs his strongest insults at Jews who taught that non\-Jewish people must be circumcised to be saved (see [2 Corinthians 11:13–15](https://ref.ly/2Cor11:13-2Cor11:15); [Galatians 1:6–9](https://ref.ly/Gal1:6-Gal1:9); [5:1–6](https://ref.ly/Gal5:1-Gal5:6), [12](https://ref.ly/Gal5:12)).

* **Associated Passages:** PHP 3:2

## Philippians 3:2–11 (id: 23108)

Paul warns believers not to be influenced by Jewish Christians who say circumcision is necessary for salvation. Paul then talks about his own conversion from Judaism to following Christ.

* **Associated Passages:** PHP 3:2–PHP 3:11

## Philippians 3:3 (id: 23112)

Circumcision was a sign that someone belonged to God’s people (see [Gen 17:10–14](https://ref.ly/Gen17:10-Gen17:14)). But the Bible teaches that those who trust in Christ are the ones who are truly circumcised in their hearts (see [Romans 2:28–29](https://ref.ly/Rom2:28-Rom2:29); compare [Jeremiah 4:4](https://ref.ly/Jer4:4); [Ephesians 2:11](https://ref.ly/Eph2:11); [Colossians 2:11–13](https://ref.ly/Col2:11-Col2:13)).

* Paul’s righteousness, as judged by human standards, also showed his dedication to the law (see also [Galatians 1:14](https://ref.ly/Gal1:14); for Paul’s later Christian view, compare [Romans 3:23](https://ref.ly/Rom3:23); [7:14–25](https://ref.ly/Rom7:14-Rom7:25)).

As a Christian, Paul now considered these things ([3:5–6](https://ref.ly/Phil3:5-Phil3:6)) worthless because of what Christ has done. A believer’s relationship with God is defined by knowing Christ and nothing else (compare [3:10](https://ref.ly/Phil3:10); [John 17:3](https://ref.ly/John17:3)). The only important thing is to gain Christ, thus receiving the gift of eternal salvation (see [John 3:16](https://ref.ly/John3:16); [1 John 5:11–13](https://ref.ly/1John5:11-1John5:13)).

* We become righteous not by following the law of Moses, but through faith in Christ. This is God's way of making us right with him: Salvation is a free gift, not something we can earn (see [Romans 1:17](https://ref.ly/Rom1:17); [3:21–26](https://ref.ly/Rom3:21-Rom3:26); [4:5–8](https://ref.ly/Rom4:5-Rom4:8); [Galatians 2:16](https://ref.ly/Gal2:16); [Ephesians 2:8–9](https://ref.ly/Eph2:8-Eph2:9)).

Experiencing resurrection from the dead means being saved from judgment and receiving eternal life (see [Revelation 20:4–6](https://ref.ly/Rev20:4-Rev20:6)). Paul understood God's holiness and the seriousness of the final judgment ([Revelation 20:11–15](https://ref.ly/Rev20:11-Rev20:15)).

2. false believers living in a worldly and immoral way (see [3:19](https://ref.ly/Phil3:19)); or
3. people who claimed to believe but rejected Paul’s teaching that the good news centers on Christ’s death on the cross (see [1 Corinthians 1:23](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:23); compare [Romans 9:33](https://ref.ly/Rom9:33); [1 Peter 2:8](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:8)).

Believers should treat others with kindness and thoughtfulness, when those people are treating them badly or causing them to suffer for their faith. Believers do not need to seek revenge or try to get back at people who hurt them. Instead, they can trust that God will handle justice in his own time and way.
