## Philippians 1:1 (id: 23060)

* Timothy was one of Paul's most trusted co\-workers and messengers. Paul lists Timothy as a co\-sender for five other letters:

    + 2 Corinthians
        + Colossians
        + 1 Thessalonians
        + 2 Thessalonians
        + Philemon
* *servants of Christ Jesus*: Paul and Timothy belonged entirely to Christ and were fully devoted to his service (see [Philippians 2:20–21](https://ref.ly/Phil2:20-Phil2:21)).
* God's holy people are made holy in God's sight by Christ's redeeming work (see [Ephesians 1:4](https://ref.ly/Eph1:4), [7](https://ref.ly/Eph1:7); [5:25–27](https://ref.ly/Eph5:25-Eph5:27); [Colossians 1:22](https://ref.ly/Col1:22)). They are being made holy by the transforming work of the Holy Spirit in their lives (compare [Philippians 4:21](https://ref.ly/Phil4:21)).
* Philippi was a Roman colony in the province of Macedonia. The church in Philippi was the first Christian community in Greece (see [Acts 16:11–40](https://ref.ly/Acts16:11-Acts16:40)).
* In the early church, church leaders provided spiritual guidance, while deacons attended to practical matters (see [1 Timothy 3:1–13](https://ref.ly/1Tim3:1-1Tim3:13)). There were no professional pastors or priests like there are today (compare [1 Corinthians 14:26–31](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:26-1Cor14:31)).

## Philippians 1:2 (id: 23068)

Grace is the kindness and blessing God gives, even though people do not deserve it. Peace means deep well\-being and calmness that come from the good news about Jesus and are produced by the Holy Spirit (see [Galatians 5:22](https://ref.ly/Gal5:22)). Both grace and peace are gifts from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ (see [Romans 5:1–2](https://ref.ly/Rom5:1-Rom5:2)).

Because God is the one who began it, we can trust that God will continue changing believers to become more like his Son (see [Romans 8:29](https://ref.ly/Rom8:29); [Ephesians 4:13](https://ref.ly/Eph4:13), [15](https://ref.ly/Eph4:15)).

*It is right for me to feel this way about all of you, since I have you in my heart*: Perhaps their lives were blessed because of Paul’s suffering and witness. Perhaps they had suffered together with him (see [1:29](https://ref.ly/Phil1:29)).

* Love is the result of Christ’s Spirit within believers ([Romans 5:5](https://ref.ly/Rom5:5); [Galatians 5:22](https://ref.ly/Gal5:22)). Love is part of the fruit of the Spirit. The fruit of the Spirit is the evidence that Christ is working in believers
* *abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insigh*t: Growing in understanding helps believers know what truly matters (see [Romans 12:2](https://ref.ly/Rom12:2)). It helps them live pure and blameless lives until Christ returns (compare [1 Thessalonians 3:12–13](https://ref.ly/1Thess3:12-1Thess3:13); [5:23](https://ref.ly/1Thess5:23)).

## Philippians 1:14 (id: 23057)

## Philippians 1:15–18 (id: 23058)

*some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry*: These people were likely other believers who did not like Paul and criticized him (see [2 Corinthians 10–13](https://ref.ly/2Cor10:1-2Cor13:14); [Galatians 4:12–20](https://ref.ly/Gal4:12-Gal4:20); [5:7–12](https://ref.ly/Gal5:7-Gal5:12)).

*will turn out for my deliverance*: Paul expected to be released from prison soon (see [1:25–26](https://ref.ly/Phil1:25-Phil1:26); [2:24](https://ref.ly/Phil2:24)).

* **Associated Passages:** PHP 1:19
* **Associated Articles:**

* **Associated Articles:** 

## Philippians 1:28 (id: 23066)

* *This is a clear sign of their destruction but of your salvation*: As translated, the persecutors would feel convicted by the example of the Philippians. The same Greek phrase could also mean *a sign to them that you are going to be destroyed, but a sign to you that you are going to be saved.* By that interpretation, the persecutors would stay blind to the truth (compare [2 Corinthians 2:15–16](https://ref.ly/2Cor2:15-2Cor2:16)).

## Philippians 2:7 (id: 23095)

* *he emptied himself*: He gave up his divine privileges and chose to live as a human. The rest of verses [7–8](https://ref.ly/Phil2:7-Phil2:8) explains this ultimate act of godly self\-giving love (compare [2 Corinthians 8:9](https://ref.ly/2Cor8:9)).
* *taking the form of a servant*: Paul might have been thinking of [Isaiah 52:13–53:12](https://ref.ly/Isa52:13-Isa53:12).
* *being made in human likeness*: Jesus became truly human while still being God (see [John 1:14](https://ref.ly/John1:14); [1 Timothy 3:16](https://ref.ly/1Tim3:16)).

## Philippians 2:9 (id: 23097)

* *Therefore*: Because of Christ's humble obedience, God raised him to the place of highest honor (see [Acts 1:9–10](https://ref.ly/Acts1:9-Acts1:10); compare [Acts 2:32–33](https://ref.ly/Acts2:32-Acts2:33); [7:55–56](https://ref.ly/Acts7:55-Acts7:56)).

* *in heaven and on earth and under the earth*: All of creation, including spiritual powers, angels, humans on earth, and those who have died, will one day acknowledge Jesus Christ's authority as Lord (see [Ephesians 1:9–10](https://ref.ly/Eph1:9-Eph1:10), [21](https://ref.ly/Eph1:21); [Colossians 1:20–25](https://ref.ly/Col1:20-Col1:25); [1 Peter 3:22](https://ref.ly/1Pet3:22)).
* *every tongue confess* (compare [Isaiah 45:23](https://ref.ly/Isa45:23); [Romans 14:11](https://ref.ly/Rom14:11)): This does not mean everyone will be saved. Not everyone will confess Jesus as Lord willingly out of love and devotion.
* *Jesus Christ is Lord*: God's personal name in the Old Testament, *Yahweh*, was considered too holy to say aloud. So Jewish people would say *Adonai* (which means “Lord”) instead. When the Old Testament was translated into Greek, *Yahweh* was represented by the Greek word *kurios* (“Lord”). This same title is often used for Jesus in the New Testament.

* *that I did not run or labor in vain*: Paul often compares the Christian life to running a race or training for a competition (see [3:12–14](https://ref.ly/Phil3:12-Phil3:14); [1 Corinthians 9:24](https://ref.ly/1Cor9:24), [26](https://ref.ly/1Cor9:26); [Galatians 2:2](https://ref.ly/Gal2:2); [5:7](https://ref.ly/Gal5:7); [2 Timothy 4:7](https://ref.ly/2Tim4:7)).

* *even if I am being poured out like a drink offering … I am glad and rejoice*: In both Jewish and pagan traditions, people would pour out wine on a sacrifice or at the altar to honor their god. Paul uses this image to say that his whole life is like an offering to God (compare [Romans 12:1](https://ref.ly/Rom12:1); [15:16](https://ref.ly/Rom15:16)).

*those dogs, those workers of evil*: Here, Paul reverses the traditional Jewish practice of calling non\-Jewish people *dogs* (see [Mark 7:27–28](https://ref.ly/Mark7:27-Mark7:28)). Paul directs his strongest insults at Jews who taught that non\-Jewish people must be circumcised to be saved (see [2 Corinthians 11:13–15](https://ref.ly/2Cor11:13-2Cor11:15); [Galatians 1:6–9](https://ref.ly/Gal1:6-Gal1:9); [5:1–6](https://ref.ly/Gal5:1-Gal5:6), [12](https://ref.ly/Gal5:12)).

Circumcision was a sign that someone belonged to God’s people (see [Gen 17:10–14](https://ref.ly/Gen17:10-Gen17:14)). But the Bible teaches that those who trust in Christ are the ones who are truly circumcised in their hearts (see [Romans 2:28–29](https://ref.ly/Rom2:28-Rom2:29); compare [Jeremiah 4:4](https://ref.ly/Jer4:4); [Ephesians 2:11](https://ref.ly/Eph2:11); [Colossians 2:11–13](https://ref.ly/Col2:11-Col2:13)). Being circumcised in heart means we are changed on the inside. Our hearts are made new by God so they can love and obey him.

As a Christian, Paul now considered these things ([3:5–6](https://ref.ly/Phil3:5-Phil3:6)) worthless because of what Christ has done. A believer’s relationship with God is defined by knowing Christ and nothing else (compare [3:10](https://ref.ly/Phil3:10); [John 17:3](https://ref.ly/John17:3)). The only important thing is to gain Christ, thus receiving the gift of eternal salvation (see [John 3:16](https://ref.ly/John3:16); [1 John 5:11–13](https://ref.ly/1John5:11-1John5:13)).
