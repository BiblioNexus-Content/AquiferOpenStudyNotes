## 1 Corinthians 1:1 (id: 13693)

* An apostle of Christ Jesus was a missionary evangelist sent out with special authority by Christ himself. The term refers to someone who was chosen and given a specific mission to spread the message of Jesus.
* Sosthenes, Paul's co\-worker, might be the same person mentioned in [Acts 18:17](https://ref.ly/Acts18:17).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 1:1

## 1 Corinthians 1:1–3 (id: 13680)

Paul usually starts his letters by introducing himself. He then offers greetings and wishes for grace and peace. He follows the typical style of ancient Greek letters but adds Christian significance.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 1:1–1CO 1:3

## 1 Corinthians 1:2 (id: 13702)

The church consists of people called by God to be his holy people. These "holy people" are those who belong to him and are dedicated to him. They are holy because of the work of Christ Jesus. God set them apart as his own people through his Son's saving work and their faith in him.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 1:2

## 1 Corinthians 1:3 (id: 13705)

Grace and peace are traditional Greek and Hebrew greetings. Grace is an unearned blessing from God's kindness. Peace is a feeling of well\-being and contentment, based on the Good News and given by the Holy Spirit (see [Galatians 5:22](https://ref.ly/Gal5:22)). Together, the phrase refers to gifts from God (see [Romans 5:1–2](https://ref.ly/Rom5:1-Rom5:2)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 1:3

## 1 Corinthians 1:4 (id: 13707)

*in Christ Jesus*: Paul often uses the phrase *in Christ Jesus* to describe the saving relationship believers have with Christ (for example, [Romans 3:24](https://ref.ly/Rom3:24); [Galatians 2:4](https://ref.ly/Gal2:4); [Ephesians 3:6](https://ref.ly/Eph3:6)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 1:4

## 1 Corinthians 1:4–9 (id: 13706)

Paul thanks God for the spiritual gifts he sees in the Corinthian Christians. He is confident that God will protect them until the end.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 1:4–1CO 1:9

## 1 Corinthians 1:5 (id: 13708)

God gave the Corinthian church many spiritual gifts. Two of these were the ability to speak well and the ability to understand spiritual truth. These gifts likely included special messages and insights from the Spirit (see [1 Corinthians 1:7](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:7)). The church at Corinth took pride in these abilities. 

*Speech* and *knowledge* appear often in this letter. Paul acknowledges the many spiritual gifts God gave the church in Corinth. Later, he corrects their misunderstandings about these gifts (see [1 Corinthians 1:18–2:5](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:18-1Cor2:5); [3:18–20](https://ref.ly/1Cor3:18-1Cor3:20); [12:1–14:40](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:1-1Cor14:40)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 1:5

## 1 Corinthians 1:7 (id: 13709)

*any spiritual gift*: See [1 Corinthians 12:8–10](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:8-1Cor12:10) and [28](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:28).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 1:7

## 1 Corinthians 1:8 (id: 13710)

Believers are saved from eternal punishment (see [Romans 8:1](https://ref.ly/Rom8:1)), but they must still answer to God for their actions (see [1 Corinthians 3:12–15](https://ref.ly/1Cor3:12-1Cor3:15); [4:4–5](https://ref.ly/1Cor4:4-1Cor4:5); [2 Corinthians 5:10](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:10)). Paul urges his readers to live a holy life in order to be blameless when Christ returns (see [Philippians 1:6](https://ref.ly/Phil1:6), [10](https://ref.ly/Phil1:10); [1 Thessalonians 3:13](https://ref.ly/1Thess3:13); [5:23–24](https://ref.ly/1Thess5:23-1Thess5:24)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 1:8

## 1 Corinthians 1:9 (id: 13711)

* *God…is faithful*: See [1 Corinthians 10:13](https://ref.ly/1Cor10:13); [Deuteronomy 7:9](https://ref.ly/Deut7:9); [1 Thessalonians 5:24](https://ref.ly/1Thess5:24).
* *who has called you*: God has chosen them and brought them into partnership with his Son (compare [Romans 8:28–39](https://ref.ly/Rom8:28-Rom8:39)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 1:9

## 1 Corinthians 1:10 (id: 13683)

* *brothers:* This term traditionally addresses family members, both male and female.
* *I appeal to you*: Paul encourages them through the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ, not his own.
* *in the name*: In Jewish culture, a person's name represented their authority and reputation.
* *that there may be no divisions*: He wanted them to avoid conflict and be united in thought and purpose, filled with the Spirit of Christ (see [Philippians 2:2](https://ref.ly/Phil2:2)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 1:10

## 1 Corinthians 1:10–17 (id: 13682)

The Corinthian believers argued about which leading evangelist (Paul, Apollos, or Peter) was the best. Paul scolded them for their arguments and worldly comparisons. As ministers of Christ and the good news about Jesus, God works through Paul and the others (see [1 Corinthians 3:1–4:7](https://ref.ly/1Cor3:1-1Cor4:7)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 1:10–1CO 1:17

## 1 Corinthians 1:10–15.58 (id: 13681)

The main part of the letter contains Paul's guidance on specific problems and questions in the Corinthian church.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 1:10

## 1 Corinthians 1:11 (id: 13684)

Chloe was a woman from Corinth, not mentioned in other parts of the Bible.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 1:11

## 1 Corinthians 1:12 (id: 13685)

* The Christians in Corinth had formed groups loyal to different leaders, but the leaders themselves did not seem to be in conflict. Paul, who first brought the Good News to Corinth, received loyalty from some.
* Apollos, now with Paul (see [1 Corinthians 16:12](https://ref.ly/1Cor16:12)), was an eloquent Jew from Alexandria who became a powerful Christian evangelist and ministered in Corinth (see [Acts 18:24–19:1](https://ref.ly/Acts18:24-Acts19:1)). He attracted followers due to his skillful speaking and ability to interpret Scripture, perhaps in contrast to Paul.
* Peter: Greek *Cephas*; see also [Matthew 16:18](https://ref.ly/Matt16:18); [John 1:42](https://ref.ly/John1:42). Peter was the main early evangelist to the Jews. He represented a more traditional Jewish perspective and had a talent for speaking to crowds (see [Acts 1:15–22](https://ref.ly/Acts1:15-Acts1:22); [2:14–40](https://ref.ly/Acts2:14-Acts2:40); [3:12–26](https://ref.ly/Acts3:12-Acts3:26); [4:8–12](https://ref.ly/Acts4:8-Acts4:12); [10:34–43](https://ref.ly/Acts10:34-Acts10:43)).
* *I follow Christ*: This might refer to a group who rejected allegiance to any human authority and saw themselves as more holy than others.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 1:12

## 1 Corinthians 1:13 (id: 13686)

Paul asks three rhetorical questions, all expecting the obvious answer, "no." Christians should devote themselves to Christ, not to his messengers.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 1:13

## 1 Corinthians 1:14 (id: 13687)

Crispus and Gaius were two of Paul's first converts in Corinth. Crispus was once a leader of the synagogue in Corinth (see [Acts 18:8](https://ref.ly/Acts18:8)). Gaius later let Paul use his home (see [Romans 16:23](https://ref.ly/Rom16:23)). This might mean he was Titius Justus, an earlier convert to Judaism who lived next to the synagogue (see [Acts 18:7](https://ref.ly/Acts18:7)). His full Roman name would then be Gaius Titius Justus.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 1:14

## 1 Corinthians 1:16 (id: 13688)

The household of Stephanas were the first people to convert in the province of Achaia (southern Greece; see [1 Corinthians 16:15](https://ref.ly/1Cor16:15)). *Household* means everyone living in the house, possibly including more than just Stephanas's immediate family.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 1:16

## 1 Corinthians 1:17 (id: 13689)

* The important thing is not baptism, but sharing the good news about Jesus*.* Baptism shows how people respond to the message.
* *not with words of wisdom*: This refers to speaking well or appealing to human wisdom.
* *lest the cross be emptied of its power*: Focusing too much on eloquence and human reasoning can distract from the simple message that Christ died for people's sins so they could be forgiven ([1 Corinthians 2:1–5](https://ref.ly/1Cor2:1-1Cor2:5); [15:1–3](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:1-1Cor15:3)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 1:17

## 1 Corinthians 1:18 (id: 13691)

To unbelievers, the idea that God saves the world through a condemned criminal seems foolish because they cannot see the truth ([2 Corinthians 4:4](https://ref.ly/2Cor4:4)). For believers, whom God has enlightened, the message of the cross feels true, and they recognize its power to touch the human heart (see [1 Corinthians 1:23–24](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:23-1Cor1:24); [Romans 1:16](https://ref.ly/Rom1:16)). Unbelievers, still in their sins, are heading towards destruction and ultimate condemnation. Believers, whose sins are forgiven, are being saved and are on their way to eternal life and glory.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 1:18

## 1 Corinthians 1:18–31 (id: 13690)

Paul contrasts eloquence and human wisdom, which some Corinthians valued, with the seemingly foolish message of the cross, which expresses God's wisdom. The followers of Apollos, in particular (see [1 Corinthians 1:12](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:12)), were likely drawn to his speaking skills and intellectual approach to ministry (see [Acts 18:24–28](https://ref.ly/Acts18:24-Acts18:28)). In contrast, Paul emphasizes that the true power is in the simple message of the cross of Christ.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 1:18–1CO 1:31

## 1 Corinthians 1:19 (id: 13692)

This quote from [Isaiah 29:14](https://ref.ly/Isa29:14) shows how God views human wisdom.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 1:19

## 1 Corinthians 1:20 (id: 13694)

In God's view, human wisdom based only on the world's knowledge and expectation is foolish. True wisdom comes from the message of the cross and Jesus Christ (see [1 Corinthians 1:24](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:24), [30](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:30)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 1:20

## 1 Corinthians 1:21 (id: 13695)

Human wisdom alone does not lead people to truly know God. This understanding comes only through the message of the cross. The world sees this message as foolish, but it saves those who believe (see [Matthew 11:25](https://ref.ly/Matt11:25)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 1:21

## 1 Corinthians 1:22 (id: 13697)

Jews who did not believe wanted to see miracles to confirm the message (see [Matthew 12:38–39](https://ref.ly/Matt12:38-Matt12:39); [16:1–4](https://ref.ly/Matt16:1-Matt16:4); [John 2:18](https://ref.ly/John2:18), [23](https://ref.ly/John2:23); [4:48](https://ref.ly/John4:48)). Greeks, famous for their philosophy schools, were interested only in human wisdom, meaning philosophical reasoning.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 1:22

## 1 Corinthians 1:22–24 (id: 13696)

Paul uses the words Greeks and Gentiles interchangeably to refer to non\-Jews.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 1:22–1CO 1:24

## 1 Corinthians 1:23 (id: 13698)

Paul insisted on sharing only the simple message of the cross, despite what unbelieving Jews and Gentiles wanted. Many Jews found the idea of a crucified Messiah contradictory. They believed crucifixion showed God's curse, not His power and blessing (see [Galatians 3:13](https://ref.ly/Gal3:13); compare [Deuteronomy 21:23](https://ref.ly/Deut21:23)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 1:23

## 1 Corinthians 1:25 (id: 13699)

What the non\-believing world sees as foolish and weak (Christ and the message of the cross) is actually wiser and stronger than anything else. It solves the world's biggest problem, which is sin, and defeats all evil forces against people.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 1:25

## 1 Corinthians 1:26 (id: 13700)

Socially and culturally, most Corinthian Christians were ordinary people. Few were among the elite (compare [Matthew 11:25](https://ref.ly/Matt11:25)). Only a few Christians, such as Erastus, the city treasurer in Corinth (see [Romans 16:23](https://ref.ly/Rom16:23)), were wealthy or *high born* (compare [James 2:5](https://ref.ly/Jas2:5)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 1:26

## 1 Corinthians 1:27–29 (id: 13701)

God chose humble and overlooked people to show his judgment on human pride (see [Romans 3:27](https://ref.ly/Rom3:27); [4:2](https://ref.ly/Rom4:2); [2 Corinthians 4:7–11](https://ref.ly/2Cor4:7-2Cor4:11); [12:8–10](https://ref.ly/2Cor12:8-2Cor12:10); [Ephesians 2:9](https://ref.ly/Eph2:9)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 1:27–1CO 1:29

## 1 Corinthians 1:30 (id: 13703)

*because of Him that you are in Christ Jesus*: When people unite with Christ Jesus, God makes them righteous, holy, and free (see [1 Corinthians 6:11](https://ref.ly/1Cor6:11); [Romans 3:21–26](https://ref.ly/Rom3:21-Rom3:26); [5:17–21](https://ref.ly/Rom5:17-Rom5:21)). This work of Christ shows God's wisdom.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 1:30

## 1 Corinthians 1:31 (id: 13704)

*"Let him who boasts, boast in the Lord"*: This quotation paraphrases [Jeremiah 9:24](https://ref.ly/Jer9:24) (compare [2 Corinthians 10:17](https://ref.ly/2Cor10:17)). Salvation comes from God's sovereign power ([1 Corinthians 2:5](https://ref.ly/1Cor2:5)) and his choice to save his people. Therefore, there is no room for human pride (see [1:29](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:29)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 1:31

## 1 Corinthians 2:1 (id: 13879)

* *When I came to you*: see [Acts 18:1–17](https://ref.ly/Acts18:1-Acts18:17).
* *with eloquence or wisdom*: Human wisdom and philosophy do not bring people to Christ (see [1 Corinthians 1:17](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:17), [21](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:21); [2:2](https://ref.ly/1Cor2:2)). The message of the cross has its own power to change the human heart (see [1:17](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:17); [Romans 1:16](https://ref.ly/Rom1:16); [Galatians 6:14](https://ref.ly/Gal6:14)).
* *the testimony about God*: See study note on 1 Corinthians 2:7.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 2:1
* **Associated Articles:** 1 Corinthians 2:7 (ID: `13883@TyndaleStudyNotes`)

## 1 Corinthians 2:1–5 (id: 13873)

God's control made Paul's preaching successful. Paul did not depend on his intelligence or personality for evangelism. Instead, he relied on the Holy Spirit's power (see also study note on 1 Corinthians 1:18–31).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 2:1–1CO 2:5
* **Associated Articles:** 1 Corinthians 1:18-31 (ID: `13690@TyndaleStudyNotes`)

## 1 Corinthians 2:3–4 (id: 13880)

Human weakness does not stop God's work ([2 Corinthians 12:7–10](https://ref.ly/2Cor12:7-2Cor12:10)). The true power is not in charismatic preaching, presentation skills, or logical arguments (compare [2 Corinthians 10:10](https://ref.ly/2Cor10:10)). It is in the message itself, focused on Christ and his death for our sins. It is also in the power of the Holy Spirit, who touches the human heart.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 2:3–1CO 2:4

## 1 Corinthians 2:6 (id: 13882)

* *Among the mature*: Only those who are spiritually mature will recognize God's wisdom. Many Corinthians could not recognize it (see [1 Corinthians 3:1–3](https://ref.ly/1Cor3:1-1Cor3:3)).
* *the rulers of this age*: The rulers of this world (see also [2:8](https://ref.ly/1Cor2:8)) are soon forgotten because Christ now rules. His enemies were defeated by his death on the cross (see [15:24–25](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:24-1Cor15:25); [Colossians 2:15](https://ref.ly/Col2:15)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 2:6

## 1 Corinthians 2:6–16 (id: 13881)

Paul highlights God's wisdom as different from the world's wisdom. True wisdom comes from the Spirit and is revealed in the so\-called "foolishness" of the good news (see [1 Corinthians 1:20–25](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:20-1Cor1:25)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 2:6–1CO 2:16

## 1 Corinthians 2:7 (id: 13883)

* *mysterious and hidden wisdom*: In Paul’s writings, "mystery" often means a truth that was once hidden but is now revealed in the good news about Jesus and his saving work (see [Romans 11:25–27](https://ref.ly/Rom11:25-Rom11:27); [1 Timothy 3:9](https://ref.ly/1Tim3:9), [16](https://ref.ly/1Tim3:16)).
* *Before time began*: From the start, God wanted to save his chosen people through Jesus (see [Romans 16:25–26](https://ref.ly/Rom16:25-Rom16:26); [Ephesians 1:9–12](https://ref.ly/Eph1:9-Eph1:12); [3:3–12](https://ref.ly/Eph3:3-Eph3:12); [Colossians 1:25–27](https://ref.ly/Col1:25-Col1:27)) and lead them to ultimate glory in the future age (see [Romans 5:2](https://ref.ly/Rom5:2); [8:18–21](https://ref.ly/Rom8:18-Rom8:21), [29–30](https://ref.ly/Rom8:29-Rom8:30); [1 Thessalonians 2:12](https://ref.ly/1Thess2:12)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 2:7

## 1 Corinthians 2:8 (id: 13884)

The leaders of this world are likely political leaders, not spiritual ones (see also [1 Corinthians 15:24](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:24); compare [Acts 3:14–15](https://ref.ly/Acts3:14-Acts3:15); [4:10](https://ref.ly/Acts4:10); [5:29–32](https://ref.ly/Acts5:29-Acts5:32)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 2:8

## 1 Corinthians 2:9 (id: 13885)

This quotation of [Isaiah 64:4](https://ref.ly/Isa64:4) supports Paul's prior point ([1 Corinthians 2:8](https://ref.ly/1Cor2:8)): People without spiritual awareness do not understand God's plan for redemption.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 2:9

## 1 Corinthians 2:10–12 (id: 13874)

* *God has revealed it to us*: Those who believe in Christ and have received his Spirit (see [1 Corinthians 6:19](https://ref.ly/1Cor6:19); [12:13](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:13); [Galatians 3:2](https://ref.ly/Gal3:2); [Ephesians 1:13](https://ref.ly/Eph1:13); [Titus 3:5](https://ref.ly/Titus3:5)) are different from the rulers of this world ([1 Corinthians 2:8](https://ref.ly/1Cor2:8)). We cannot understand God's deep secrets through worldly wisdom or philosophy. Only God's Spirit can reveal God's thoughts to his people (see [1 John 2:20](https://ref.ly/1John2:20), [27](https://ref.ly/1John2:27); compare [Matthew 11:25–27](https://ref.ly/Matt11:25-Matt11:27)). God has kindly given his Spirit to his people so they can know the wonderful things he has freely given them (compare [John 16:13–14](https://ref.ly/John16:13-John16:14)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 2:10–1CO 2:12

## 1 Corinthians 2:13 (id: 13875)

*in words taught by the Spirit**:* Spiritual wisdom differs from human wisdom. The way spiritual wisdom is taught must differ from the way human wisdom is taught. Communicating and learning spiritual truth must happen through the Spirit's dimension and power. It is not just a rational, human exercise.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 2:13

## 1 Corinthians 2:14 (id: 13876)

*The natural man*: Unbelievers have minds that are closed to the Spirit. They live in the natural world and see life only through physical eyes (see [2 Corinthians 4:4](https://ref.ly/2Cor4:4)). They cannot understand the importance of the good news about Jesus, as it is mainly a spiritual message.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 2:14

## 1 Corinthians 2:15 (id: 13877)

*The spiritual man*: Those with the Spirit have a true understanding of divine revelation.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 2:15

## 1 Corinthians 2:16 (id: 13878)

* This quote from [Isaiah 40:13](https://ref.ly/Isa40:13) illustrates how divine wisdom goes beyond human understanding (see also [Romans 11:34](https://ref.ly/Rom11:34)).
* *But we have the mind of Chris*t: Connected to Christ, believers receive the Spirit of Christ, which reveals Christ’s thoughts to them.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 2:16

## 1 Corinthians 3:1 (id: 13894)

* The Corinthians did not act like the spiritual people Paul described in [1 Corinthians 2:15](https://ref.ly/1Cor2:15). Instead, they behaved like unbelievers drawn to worldly wisdom and values.
* *as infants in Christ*: Although they converted, their lives and thoughts did not show maturity in Christ or the transformative perspective of his Spirit.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 3:1

## 1 Corinthians 3:1–4 (id: 13887)

Paul criticizes the Christians in Corinth for not growing spiritually.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 3:1–1CO 3:4

## 1 Corinthians 3:1–4.7 (id: 13886)

After comparing human and spiritual wisdom, Paul addresses the divisions in the Corinthian church (see [1 Corinthians 1:10–12](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:10-1Cor1:12)), especially their undue loyalty to him and Apollos.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 3:1–1CO 4:7

## 1 Corinthians 3:2 (id: 13897)

Because the Corinthian Christians were not spiritually mature, Paul could not discuss the deeper truths of life in Christ, which are like solid food (see [1 Corinthians 2:6–7](https://ref.ly/1Cor2:6-1Cor2:7)) meant for mature Christians. Instead, he had to focus on milk, the basic teachings of the good news about Jesus (compare [Hebrews 5:12–14](https://ref.ly/Heb5:12-Heb5:14); [6:1–3](https://ref.ly/Heb6:1-Heb6:3); [1 Peter 2:2](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:2)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 3:2

## 1 Corinthians 3:3 (id: 13898)

Their jealousy and arguments (see [1 Corinthians 1:10–12](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:10-1Cor1:12)) showed they behaved like unbelievers. They followed their sinful nature, not the Spirit of God (compare [2 Corinthians 12:20](https://ref.ly/2Cor12:20); [Galatians 5:19–21](https://ref.ly/Gal5:19-Gal5:21)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 3:3

## 1 Corinthians 3:4 (id: 13899)

In Greek culture, people often identified with a favorite teacher (see [1 Corinthians 1:12](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:12)). However, this does not align with the teachings of Christ ([3:5–9](https://ref.ly/1Cor3:5-1Cor3:9); compare [Matthew 23:8–10](https://ref.ly/Matt23:8-Matt23:10)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 3:4

## 1 Corinthians 3:5–9 (id: 13900)

* It is wrong to proudly identify as a follower of a human teacher because God does the real work of redemption. He deserves the honor.
* *They are servant**s:* See [2 Corinthians 4:5](https://ref.ly/2Cor4:5).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 3:5–1CO 3:9

## 1 Corinthians 3:6 (id: 13901)

* *I planted the seed:* See [Acts 18:1–11](https://ref.ly/Acts18:1-Acts18:11).
* *Apollos watered it*: See [Acts 18:27–19:1](https://ref.ly/Acts18:27-Acts19:1).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 3:6

## 1 Corinthians 3:11 (id: 13890)

The church's only foundation is Jesus Christ himself (see [Isaiah 28:16](https://ref.ly/Isa28:16); [1 Peter 2:4–8](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:4-1Pet2:8); compare [Romans 9:33](https://ref.ly/Rom9:33)). However, the Corinthians risked making a human teacher their foundation.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 3:11

## 1 Corinthians 3:12–15 (id: 13891)

Some things people build on Christ's foundation will last. Others will burn in judgment (see [Malachi 4:1](https://ref.ly/Mal4:1)). On judgment day*,* the work of each church teacher will be evaluated (see [James 3:1](https://ref.ly/Jas3:1); also [Romans 14:10–12](https://ref.ly/Rom14:10-Rom14:12); [2 Corinthians 5:10](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:10)). Those with faithful teachings will earn a reward*.* Others will face great loss*,* not of salvation but of reward. They will be saved*,* but barely, like someone rescued through flames (see [Amos 4:11](https://ref.ly/Amos4:11); [Zechariah 3:2](https://ref.ly/Zech3:2); [Jude 1:23](https://ref.ly/Jude1:23)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 3:12–1CO 3:15

## 1 Corinthians 3:16–17 (id: 13892)

Christians should be careful about what they teach and how they interact with each other. The community of believers is God's temple, where God's Spirit lives (see [Ephesians 2:21–22](https://ref.ly/Eph2:21-Eph2:22)). God's temple is holy (see [1 Corinthians 1:2](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:2)). There are serious consequences for anyone who harms God's temple through jealousy, arguments, or division (see [3:3–4](https://ref.ly/1Cor3:3-1Cor3:4)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 3:16–1CO 3:17

## 1 Corinthians 3:18–20 (id: 13893)

Paul contrasts human wisdom with divine wisdom again (see [1 Corinthians 1:18–25](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:18-1Cor1:25)). He uses Old Testament quotes to encourage the Corinthians. He urges them to be willing to seem foolish to the world so that they can be truly wise in God's eyes.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 3:18–1CO 3:20

## 1 Corinthians 3:21–23 (id: 13895)

As God's privileged children, they can now claim everything—the world, life, death, the present, and the future (see [Romans 8:38–39](https://ref.ly/Rom8:38-Rom8:39)). Therefore, claiming a specific human leader is unnecessary.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 3:21–1CO 3:23

## 1 Corinthians 3:23 (id: 13896)

They may claim everything as their own, but Christ has claimed them for himself (see [Romans 14:7–9](https://ref.ly/Rom14:7-Rom14:9)). In Christ, God ultimately claims them (see [1 Corinthians 6:19–20](https://ref.ly/1Cor6:19-1Cor6:20); [7:23](https://ref.ly/1Cor7:23)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 3:23

## 1 Corinthians 4:1 (id: 13909)

* Do not see Paul and Apollos as leaders competing for followers. They are servants of Christ, explaining God's mysteries. They are stewards managing the master's business (as in [Luke 12:42](https://ref.ly/Luke12:42)). Their lives focus on their master's concerns, not their own.
* *mysteries of God*: See study note on 1 Corinthians 2:7.

Paul highlights his loyalty and sincere intentions as an apostle of Christ. However, only God can judge a person's heart.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 4:1–1CO 4:5

## 1 Corinthians 4:3–4 (id: 13910)

Paul's greatest wish was to be faithful to God. What people thought of him, including his own opinion, did not matter.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 4:3–1CO 4:4

## 1 Corinthians 4:5 (id: 13911)

*judge nothing*: Only the Lord can truly know a person's heart. When he returns, he will judge. Paul took God's judgment of his ministry very seriously (see [2 Corinthians 5:9–10](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:9-2Cor5:10); [Philippians 2:16](https://ref.ly/Phil2:16); [1 Thessalonians 2:19–20](https://ref.ly/1Thess2:19-1Thess2:20); compare [2 Corinthians 1:14](https://ref.ly/2Cor1:14)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 4:5

## 1 Corinthians 4:6–21 (id: 13912)

Paul criticizes the Corinthian Christians for their arrogance ([1 Corinthians 4:6–13](https://ref.ly/1Cor4:6-1Cor4:13)) and then advises them like a father ([4:14–21](https://ref.ly/1Cor4:14-1Cor4:21)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 4:6–1CO 4:21

## 1 Corinthians 4:7 (id: 13913)

Pride in a leader comes from not realizing that everything is a gift from God. We should feel humble gratitude instead.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 4:7

## 1 Corinthians 4:8–13 (id: 13914)

Paul points out the difference between himself and the Corinthians. Their attitudes show worldly wisdom, while his shows God's wisdom. The Corinthians were proud and thought they had achieved everything, but they still had much to learn (see [Revelation 3:17–18](https://ref.ly/Rev3:17-Rev3:18); compare with [Philippians 3:12–14](https://ref.ly/Phil3:12-Phil3:14)). If they had truly achieved everything, they would share in Paul's suffering ([1 Corinthians 4:11–13](https://ref.ly/1Cor4:11-1Cor4:13)). Unlike the Corinthians, who were proud of their achievements and the respect they received, the apostles faced scorn and contempt.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 4:8–1CO 4:13

## 1 Corinthians 4:9 (id: 13915)

*God has displayed us apostles*: Like prisoners condemned to die by facing wild animals in the amphitheater, the apostles were a spectacle. Paul gladly accepted suffering because God used it to bless others (see [2 Corinthians 1:4–7](https://ref.ly/2Cor1:4-2Cor1:7); [4:7–12](https://ref.ly/2Cor4:7-2Cor4:12); [Philippians 2:17](https://ref.ly/Phil2:17); [Colossians 1:24](https://ref.ly/Col1:24)).

## 1 Corinthians 4:11–13 (id: 13903)

Paul reminds the Corinthians of the hardships he endured for Christ (see [2 Corinthians 6:4–5](https://ref.ly/2Cor6:4-2Cor6:5); [11:23–28](https://ref.ly/2Cor11:23-2Cor11:28)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 4:11–1CO 4:13

## 1 Corinthians 4:12 (id: 13904)

* *We work hard with our own hands*: To avoid accusations of taking money, Paul chose to support himself ([1 Corinthians 9:3–18](https://ref.ly/1Cor9:3-1Cor9:18); [Acts 18:3](https://ref.ly/Acts18:3); [20:33–35](https://ref.ly/Acts20:33-Acts20:35)).
* *When we are vilified, we bless*: Paul's response followed the teachings of Jesus ([Matthew 5:44–45](https://ref.ly/Matt5:44-Matt5:45); compare [Romans 12:14](https://ref.ly/Rom12:14), [17–21](https://ref.ly/Rom12:17-Rom12:21)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 4:12

## 1 Corinthians 4:14–16 (id: 13905)

As their spiritual father who first shared the good news about Jesus, Paul shows his true concern for their well\-being (see [1 Thessalonians 2:11–12](https://ref.ly/1Thess2:11-1Thess2:12)). As his beloved children*,* they should listen to him and follow his example and teachings (see [1 Corinthians 11:1](https://ref.ly/1Cor11:1); [Galatians 4:12](https://ref.ly/Gal4:12); [Philippians 3:17](https://ref.ly/Phil3:17); [4:9](https://ref.ly/Phil4:9); [1 Thessalonians 1:6](https://ref.ly/1Thess1:6); [2 Thessalonians 3:7–9](https://ref.ly/2Thess3:7-2Thess3:9)).

Paul ends this part about divisions in the church with kind, fatherly advice and a warning ([1 Corinthians 1:10–4:21](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:10-1Cor4:21)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 4:14–1CO 4:21

## 1 Corinthians 4:17 (id: 13907)

Timothy, Paul's spiritual child and close associate, was with Paul when he first preached the good news about Jesus in Corinth (see [2 Corinthians 1:19](https://ref.ly/2Cor1:19)). Paul sent him to clearly explain what it means to follow Christ Jesus.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 4:17

## 1 Corinthians 4:18–20 (id: 13908)

Some might have thought Paul was afraid to visit because he sent Timothy. However, Paul was very busy with his work in Ephesus at that time ([Acts 19:8–20](https://ref.ly/Acts19:8-Acts19:20); see study note on Acts 19:10). He planned to visit soon (see [1 Corinthians 16:5–9](https://ref.ly/1Cor16:5-1Cor16:9); [Acts 19:21–22](https://ref.ly/Acts19:21-Acts19:22); [20:1–3](https://ref.ly/Acts20:1-Acts20:3); compare [2 Corinthians 1:15–2:4](https://ref.ly/2Cor1:15-2Cor2:4)) and would face those who opposed him. He would show they were just talkers. His actions and words would prove God's power (see also [1 Corinthians 2:4](https://ref.ly/1Cor2:4)).

## 1 Corinthians 5:1 (id: 13920)

*sexual immorality*: A man was having sexual relations with his stepmother. Even pagans did not engage in such behavior. It violated both the law of Moses (see [Leviticus 18:7–8](https://ref.ly/Lev18:7-Lev18:8)) and Roman law (Gaius, *Institutes* 1\.63\).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 5:1

## 1 Corinthians 5:1–8 (id: 13916)

Paul addresses sexual immorality in the church and tells the Christians to remove an unashamed wrongdoer from fellowship.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 5:1–1CO 5:8

## 1 Corinthians 5:2 (id: 13921)

* The Corinthian Christians were proud (see [1 Corinthians 4:8](https://ref.ly/1Cor4:8), [10](https://ref.ly/1Cor4:10), [18](https://ref.ly/1Cor4:18); [5:6](https://ref.ly/1Cor5:6)), but they should have felt sorrow and shame for the sin among them.
* *have removed from your fellowship the man*: This instruction suggests that the man ignored their requests, or that such obvious sin needed immediate discipline (compare [Matthew 18:15–18](https://ref.ly/Matt18:15-Matt18:18)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 5:2

## 1 Corinthians 5:3 (id: 13922)

*in spirit*: Paul shared a spiritual connection with them. He had authority from God through the Spirit, which worked well among them.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 5:3

## 1 Corinthians 5:5 (id: 13923)

* The instruction to remove this man is not directly in the Greek text but is suggested by [1 Corinthians 5:2](https://ref.ly/1Cor5:2), [13](https://ref.ly/1Cor5:13).
* *hand this man over to Satan*: Compare with [1 Timothy 1:20](https://ref.ly/1Tim1:20). Those outside God's church fall under Satan's power and control (see [Ephesians 2:2](https://ref.ly/Eph2:2); [1 John 5:19](https://ref.ly/1John5:19)).
* *for the destruction of the flesh*: *The flesh* could mean his evil desires or his physical life (for example, *so that he will die*).
* *so that his spirit may be saved*: He might repent and avoid condemnation (compare with [2 Corinthians 2:5–8](https://ref.ly/2Cor2:5-2Cor2:8)).
* *on the Day of the Lord*: This includes the final judgment.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 5:5

## 1 Corinthians 5:6–7 (id: 13924)

* Yeast often symbolized sin (see [Matthew 16:6](https://ref.ly/Matt16:6), [12](https://ref.ly/Matt16:12); [Mark 8:15](https://ref.ly/Mark8:15); [Luke 12:1](https://ref.ly/Luke12:1); [Galatians 5:9](https://ref.ly/Gal5:9)). Jews ceremonially removed yeast from their homes before the annual Passover meal ([Exodus 12:19](https://ref.ly/Exod12:19); [13:7](https://ref.ly/Exod13:7)).
* *Get rid of the old leaven*: If left unchecked, sin could spread throughout the church, just as yeast spreads through dough.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 5:6–1CO 5:7

## 1 Corinthians 5:7–8 (id: 13925)

Paul compares the Jewish Passover celebration to Christ's sacrifice. During Passover, people sacrificed a lamb and ate unleavened bread (see [Exodus 12:1–27](https://ref.ly/Exod12:1-Exod12:27); [13:3–7](https://ref.ly/Exod13:3-Exod13:7)). Christ's sacrifice, which happened at Passover ([Matthew 26:2](https://ref.ly/Matt26:2); compare [John 1:29](https://ref.ly/John1:29); [1 Peter 1:19](https://ref.ly/1Pet1:19)), removes sin for believers.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 5:7–1CO 5:8

## 1 Corinthians 5:9 (id: 13927)

* *I wrote you in my letter* refers to an earlier letter that is now lost.

The church should guide and correct anyone known to be living in sin.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 5:9–1CO 5:13

## 1 Corinthians 5:10 (id: 13917)

Paul usually advised believers to stay connected with sinful non\-believers (for example, [1 Corinthians 10:27](https://ref.ly/1Cor10:27)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 5:10

## 1 Corinthians 5:11 (id: 13918)

Separating from a believer living in sin was intended to uphold the Christian community's high moral standards. This social pressure might also encourage a brother or sister to repent (see [2 Thessalonians 3:6](https://ref.ly/2Thess3:6), [14](https://ref.ly/2Thess3:14)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 5:11

## 1 Corinthians 5:12–13 (id: 13919)

Christians should not judge or discipline the sins of non\-believers, but they should address the sins of fellow believers.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 5:12–1CO 5:13

## 1 Corinthians 6:1–11 (id: 13928)

When serious disagreements occur between two Christians, they should resolve them with the help of other believers, not in a secular court.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 6:1–1CO 6:11

## 1 Corinthians 6:2–3 (id: 13936)

One day, believers will help judge the world. Even angels will assist alongside the Son of Man, who is the Judge of all people (see [Daniel 7:13](https://ref.ly/Dan7:13), [22](https://ref.ly/Dan7:22), [27](https://ref.ly/Dan7:27); [Matthew 19:28](https://ref.ly/Matt19:28); [John 5:27](https://ref.ly/John5:27); [Acts 17:31](https://ref.ly/Acts17:31); [Revelation 3:21](https://ref.ly/Rev3:21); [20:4](https://ref.ly/Rev20:4)). Because of this responsibility, Christians should resolve their disagreements over small matters.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 6:2–1CO 6:3

## 1 Corinthians 6:4–6 (id: 13937)

*I say this to your shame*: It is a problem for Christians to settle disputes in non\-religious courts, as if no one in the church can help resolve them.

## 1 Corinthians 6:7 (id: 13938)

* *The very fact that you have lawsuits among you means that you are thoroughly defeated already:* Suing a fellow believer shows self\-interest instead of caring for others or honoring God.
* *Why not rather be wronged?:* Christians should follow Christ's example of self\-sacrifice (see [Matthew 5:38–42](https://ref.ly/Matt5:38-Matt5:42)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 6:7

## 1 Corinthians 6:8 (id: 13939)

Some of the Corinthian believers were not following Christ's example of sacrificial love. They were cheating even their fellow believers. Their actions and attitudes were wrong.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 6:8

## 1 Corinthians 6:9 (id: 13941)

* *Do not be deceived*: Sin is misleading, and believers should not take it lightly or think it is acceptable ([Jeremiah 17:9](https://ref.ly/Jer17:9)).
* Continuing to engage in sexual sin without repentance shows a heart not renewed by the Holy Spirit. Sexual sins include adultery (see [Exodus 20:14](https://ref.ly/Exod20:14); [Matthew 5:27–28](https://ref.ly/Matt5:27-Matt5:28)) and practicing homosexuality (compare [Leviticus 18:22](https://ref.ly/Lev18:22); [20:13](https://ref.ly/Lev20:13); [Romans 1:26–27](https://ref.ly/Rom1:26-Rom1:27); [1 Timothy 1:10](https://ref.ly/1Tim1:10)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 6:9

## 1 Corinthians 6:10 (id: 13929)

*nor … will inherit the kingdom of God*: Repeating this point (also [6:9](https://ref.ly/1Cor6:9)) highlights the serious consequences of living in sin. For similar warnings, see [Galatians 5:19–21](https://ref.ly/Gal5:19-Gal5:21); [Ephesians 5:5](https://ref.ly/Eph5:5); compare [Colossians 3:5–6](https://ref.ly/Col3:5-Col3:6).

## 1 Corinthians 6:11 (id: 13930)

* After the strong warning in [Leviticus 6:9–10](https://ref.ly/1Cor6:9-1Cor6:10), Paul reassures his readers of their true conversion.
* *But you were washed:* (see [Acts 22:16](https://ref.ly/Acts22:16)) Cleanliness symbolizes the righteousness that comes from forgiveness (see [Titus 3:5](https://ref.ly/Titus3:5)). God himself made them holy (see [1 Corinthians 1:2](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:2)).
* They became right with God through their connection with the Lord Jesus Christ and the transformative work of the Spirit of our God. God forgave them. He views them as righteous (see [Romans 1:17](https://ref.ly/Rom1:17); [3:21–26](https://ref.ly/Rom3:21-Rom3:26)), and their lives have truly improved (see [Titus 3:5–7](https://ref.ly/Titus3:5-Titus3:7)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 6:11

## 1 Corinthians 6:12 (id: 13932)

Some Christians believed they could do anything, including being sexually immoral. Paul disagrees, saying not everything is beneficial. True Christians should live disciplined lives (see [10:23](https://ref.ly/1Cor10:23); [Galatians 5:13](https://ref.ly/Gal5:13)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 6:12

## 1 Corinthians 6:12–20 (id: 13931)

Paul provides several reasons why Christians should avoid sexual immorality.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 6:12–1CO 6:20

## 1 Corinthians 6:13–14 (id: 13933)

*"**Food for the stomach and the stomach for food**"*: Some Corinthian Christians used this idea to justify their sexual immorality. They claimed, "The body was made for sex, and sex for the body." This analogy is false because our bodies were made for the Lord, and sexual immorality does not honor him. Given his care for our bodies and the future resurrection, we must use our bodies for holy purposes in God's service.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 6:13–1CO 6:14

## 1 Corinthians 6:15–17 (id: 13934)

Being a Christian means being spiritually connected to Christ in both life and death (see [Romans 6:3–11](https://ref.ly/Rom6:3-Rom6:11)). Because of this, believers' bodies are parts of Christ (see [1 Corinthians 12:12–28](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:12-1Cor12:28); [Romans 12:4–5](https://ref.ly/Rom12:4-Rom12:5)). This spiritual connection (see [John 14:20](https://ref.ly/John14:20); [17:21–23](https://ref.ly/John17:21-John17:23)) means they should not misuse their bodies by joining with a prostitute.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 6:15–1CO 6:17

## 1 Corinthians 6:18–20 (id: 13935)

* For Christians, the body is a temple of the Holy Spirit (see study note on 1 Corinthians 3:16–17; compare [2 Corinthians 6:16](https://ref.ly/2Cor6:16)). Sexual sin violates this sacred space and the divine presence.
* *You are not your own*: Christians cannot claim their bodies as their own because they have been bought with a high price, the blood of Christ (compare [1 Corinthians 7:23](https://ref.ly/1Cor7:23); [Revelation 5:9](https://ref.ly/Rev5:9)). Christ has claimed every part of their lives for God’s glory (see [Romans 14:7–9](https://ref.ly/Rom14:7-Rom14:9); [2 Corinthians 5:14–15](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:14-2Cor5:15)).

## 1 Corinthians 7:1 (id: 13952)

*It is good to abstain from sexual relations*: Both Paul and Jesus encouraged living a celibate life for God (see [Matthew 19:10–12](https://ref.ly/Matt19:10-Matt19:12)). Paul's emphasis on celibacy may have been shaped by his expectation that the end of the age was near (see [1 Corinthians 7:29–31](https://ref.ly/1Cor7:29-1Cor7:31)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 7:1

## 1 Corinthians 7:1–40 (id: 13943)

Paul often says that true Christians, as servants of Christ, belong completely to Christ for his service. Because of this, he suggests Christians stay single. However, he admits that getting married is not a sin.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 7:1–1CO 7:40

## 1 Corinthians 7:1–16.4 (id: 13942)

Paul now answers the questions the Corinthians asked him in a letter, starting with the topic of marriage (see [1 Corinthians 7:25](https://ref.ly/1Cor7:25); [8:1](https://ref.ly/1Cor8:1); [12:1](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:1); [16:1](https://ref.ly/1Cor16:1)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 7:1

## 1 Corinthians 7:2 (id: 13955)

Due to widespread sexual immorality*,* Paul advises most Christians to marry ([1 Corinthians 7:9](https://ref.ly/1Cor7:9)). He balances the ideal of celibacy with an understanding of physical needs.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 7:2

## 1 Corinthians 7:3–4 (id: 13956)

To avoid the temptation of sexual immorality, married Christians should consider their spouse's sexual needs. Both partners have the right to sexual intimacy in marriage, and they should not withhold it. In marriage, each person gives their spouse authority over their body, but this authority should never be abused.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 7:3–1CO 7:4

## 1 Corinthians 7:6–7 (id: 13959)

Paul prefers being single, but he acknowledges that both marriage and being single are gifts from God to different people.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 7:6–1CO 7:7

## 1 Corinthians 7:8–9 (id: 13960)

Paul advises that staying unmarried is better because it allows more opportunities to serve Christ without distraction ([1 Corinthians 7:32–35](https://ref.ly/1Cor7:32-1Cor7:35)). However, even with its distractions, an honorable marriage is much better than living with unsatisfied sexual desire.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 7:8–1CO 7:9

## 1 Corinthians 7:10–11 (id: 13944)

* Paul advises Christian couples considering divorce.
* *not I, but the Lord*: This does not mean Paul's other instructions (see [1 Corinthians 7:12](https://ref.ly/1Cor7:12), [25](https://ref.ly/1Cor7:25), [40](https://ref.ly/1Cor7:40)) have less authority. It means this advice is based on known teachings of Jesus (see [Matthew 5:32](https://ref.ly/Matt5:32); [19:9](https://ref.ly/Matt19:9); [Mark 10:11](https://ref.ly/Mark10:11-Mark10:12)–[12](https://ref.ly/Mark10:11-Mark10:12); [Luke 16:18](https://ref.ly/Luke16:18)).
* *But if she does*: Paul recognizes that some couples struggle to live together, but even then, they must honor their marriage vows and remain faithful to their spouse alone (see [1 Corinthians 7:27](https://ref.ly/1Cor7:27); [Romans 7:2](https://ref.ly/Rom7:2)).

## 1 Corinthians 7:14 (id: 13946)

By staying committed to the marriage, the Christian makes the unbelieving spouse holy. This holiness also benefits the children, who gain from having a Christian parent (see [Malachi 2:15](https://ref.ly/Mal2:15)).

## 1 Corinthians 7:15 (id: 13947)

If the unbeliever ends the marriage, the believing husband or wife can let them go. God wants his people to live in peace, not in the unbearable conflict of a mixed marriage that the non\-Christian spouse no longer wants.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 7:15

## 1 Corinthians 7:16 (id: 13948)

There is always hope that the believing spouse will lead the unbelieving partner to faith in Christ. However, the Greek text is unclear and might also mean there is no guarantee the believing partner will ever convince the unbelieving spouse.

Circumcision shows the principle mentioned earlier ([1 Corinthians 7:17](https://ref.ly/1Cor7:17)). All Jewish males were circumcised. Some tried to reverse it to fit into Gentile society (see *1 Maccabees* 1:14–15; Josephus, *Antiquities* 12\.5\.1\), but Paul advises against this. Circumcision is not very important compared to following God's commandments, like loving God and others (see also [Romans 2:28–29](https://ref.ly/Rom2:28-Rom2:29); [4:9–12](https://ref.ly/Rom4:9-Rom4:12); [Galatians 5:2–6](https://ref.ly/Gal5:2-Gal5:6); [6:12–15](https://ref.ly/Gal6:12-Gal6:15); [Philippians 3:2–3](https://ref.ly/Phil3:2-Phil3:3)).

* Slavery shows the general idea mentioned in [1 Corinthians 7:17](https://ref.ly/1Cor7:17), [20](https://ref.ly/1Cor7:20), [24](https://ref.ly/1Cor7:24). Slavery was common in the Greco\-Roman world, and many Christian converts were slaves serving wealthy families. According to Paul, like circumcision, being a slave is not very important for a Christian. Even as a slave, a Christian is spiritually free from sin, death, and the law (see [Romans 6:14](https://ref.ly/Rom6:14); [7:4–6](https://ref.ly/Rom7:4-Rom7:6); [8:2](https://ref.ly/Rom8:2)). As a free person, the believer is still a servant of Christ (see [Ephesians 6:5–6](https://ref.ly/Eph6:5-Eph6:6); [1 Peter 2:16](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:16)).
* As someone bought at a high price, the free Christian should not be controlled by the world (see [1 Cor 6:20](https://ref.ly/1Cor6:20)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 7:21–1CO 7:23

## 1 Corinthians 7:25–35 (id: 13954)

Paul provides three reasons why it is often better for single people to stay unmarried. First, single people face fewer daily problems than married people. Second, since the end is near, Christians should not let marriage and worldly matters be their main focus. Their main focus should be Christ and eternity. Third, marriage involves earthly responsibilities and divided interests, so those who stay single can dedicate their lives more fully to serving Christ.

## 1 Corinthians 7:36–38 (id: 13957)

Paul suggests choosing a celibate life over marriage. However, he permits marriage if sexual desires become too tempting. Those who can control their desires well should consider celibacy.

## 1 Corinthians 8:1 (id: 13965)

"We all have knowledge" was a saying among the Corinthian Christians. The *knowledge* referred to religious understanding. Some Christians believed their superior knowledge made them ignore others' opinions.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 8:1

## 1 Corinthians 8:1–11.1 (id: 13961)

Paul addresses the Corinthians' question about eating food offered to idols. In the Greco\-Roman world, temples and shrines dedicated to pagan gods were common. Worshipers often offered animal sacrifices, and pagan priests sold the extra meat in the market. Christians wondered if they could eat this meat. 

Was meat from a sacrifice to a pagan god impure? Paul does not mention the Jewish Christian leaders' prohibition in [Acts 15:20](https://ref.ly/Acts15:20), [29](https://ref.ly/Acts15:29). Instead, he stresses that actions should be guided by love and consideration for others. After introducing the topic ([1 Corinthians 8:1–13](https://ref.ly/1Cor8:1-1Cor8:13)), he shares examples of giving up one's rights for others' sake ([9:1–27](https://ref.ly/1Cor9:1-1Cor9:27)) and offers advice on three specific situations believers faced.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 8:1

God acknowledges those who truly love Him, not just those who know all the answers (see [1 Corinthians 13:12](https://ref.ly/1Cor13:12); [Galatians 4:9](https://ref.ly/Gal4:9)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 8:2–1CO 8:3

## 1 Corinthians 8:4–6 (id: 13967)

In reality, the idols to which such meat is sacrificed are not gods, because there is only one God ([Deuteronomy 6:4](https://ref.ly/Deut6:4); see also [Deuteronomy 4:35](https://ref.ly/Deut4:35), [39](https://ref.ly/Deut4:39); [10:19–20](https://ref.ly/Deut10:19-Deut10:20)). He is the Creator of everything, including the meat being sacrificed for the idols. The only ultimate reality is God, the Father, and the one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things were created (see also [John 1:3](https://ref.ly/John1:3); [Colossians 1:16](https://ref.ly/Col1:16); [Hebrews 1:2](https://ref.ly/Heb1:2)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 8:4–1CO 8:6

## 1 Corinthians 8:7 (id: 13968)

Many Corinthian believers grew up in a pagan world and saw eating such meat as worshiping the god it was sacrificed to. For these Christians, eating meat offered to an idol would go against their weak consciences (see [8:10–12](https://ref.ly/1Cor8:10-1Cor8:12); [10:28–29](https://ref.ly/1Cor10:28-1Cor10:29); [Romans 14:13–23](https://ref.ly/Rom14:13-Rom14:23)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 8:7

## 1 Corinthians 8:8 (id: 13969)

The Corinthians' connection with God did not depend on whether they ate certain foods or not, regardless of the food's source (compare [Romans 14:17](https://ref.ly/Rom14:17)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 8:8

## 1 Corinthians 8:9–10 (id: 13970)

Believers should ensure their actions, like eating sacrificial meat, do not cause others to struggle (compare [Romans 14:13](https://ref.ly/Rom14:13), [20–21](https://ref.ly/Rom14:20-Rom14:21); [Galatians 5:13](https://ref.ly/Gal5:13)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 8:9–1CO 8:10

## 1 Corinthians 8:11 (id: 13962)

* Believers who insist on eating food offered to idols (because they believe their knowledge allows them to eat it) could harm less mature Christians. These less mature Christians may see eating this meat as worshipping pagan gods.
* *for whom Christ died*: Compare [Romans 14:15](https://ref.ly/Rom14:15).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 8:11

## 1 Corinthians 8:12 (id: 13963)

Causing immature believers to sin by violating their conscience is like sinning against Christ, who has claimed them for himself (compare [Matthew 25:40](https://ref.ly/Matt25:40), [45](https://ref.ly/Matt25:45)).

## 1 Corinthians 9:1–2 (id: 13972)

* These four rhetorical questions expect a positive answer. The first question, following his discussion in [8:1–13](https://ref.ly/1Cor8:1-1Cor8:13), asserts Paul's freedom from Jewish ritual obligations. However, he later emphasizes (see [9:19–23](https://ref.ly/1Cor9:19-1Cor9:23)) that he willingly follows Jewish practices to win them to Christ. The other three questions assert Paul's apostolic authority, which some in Corinth questioned.
* *For you are the seal*: For skeptics, Paul's apostolic calling was confirmed by his encounter with Jesus on the road to Damascus (see [15:8](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:8); [Acts 9:3–6](https://ref.ly/Acts9:3-Acts9:6), [17](https://ref.ly/Acts9:17)). Also, the Corinthians, who came to faith through Paul's evangelism (see [Acts 18:1–11](https://ref.ly/Acts18:1-Acts18:11)), were proof of his status as an apostle.

However, to avoid any criticism, he chose not to use this right (see [9:6](https://ref.ly/1Cor9:6), [12](https://ref.ly/1Cor9:12), [14–15](https://ref.ly/1Cor9:14-1Cor9:15), [18](https://ref.ly/1Cor9:18); [2 Corinthians 11:7–9](https://ref.ly/2Cor11:7-2Cor11:9); [12:13–14](https://ref.ly/2Cor12:13-2Cor12:14)).

* To show how seriously the Corinthians must take their salvation, Paul refers to the Isthmian games, a well\-known athletic event held in Corinth every two years.
* *Everyone who competes in the games trains with strict discipline*: Athletes must have strict self\-discipline to compete for a prize. In Paul's time, athletes trained rigorously for months before competing. Similarly, strict self\-discipline (see [Galatians 5:22–23](https://ref.ly/Gal5:22-Gal5:23)) is needed to achieve the eternal prize of salvation. Christians must follow the daily discipline of obeying Christ.
* *for a crown that is perishable*: Athletic prizes were often wreaths made of laurel leaves (see [2 Timothy 4:8](https://ref.ly/2Tim4:8); [James 1:12](https://ref.ly/Jas1:12); [1 Peter 5:4](https://ref.ly/1Pet5:4); [Revelation 2:10](https://ref.ly/Rev2:10)).

* *that rock was Christ*: Paul explains Israel's experience as a parallel to God's provision in the wilderness and the Lord's Supper ([1 Corinthians 10:14–18](https://ref.ly/1Cor10:14-1Cor10:18); compare [John 4:14](https://ref.ly/John4:14); [7:37–39](https://ref.ly/John7:37-John7:39); [Revelation 22:17](https://ref.ly/Rev22:17)).

* Paul clarifies a Christian’s freedom by stressing the importance of doing what benefits others (see [6:12](https://ref.ly/1Cor6:12); [10:32–33](https://ref.ly/1Cor10:32-1Cor10:33); [Romans 14:13–15](https://ref.ly/Rom14:13-Rom14:15), [19–21](https://ref.ly/Rom14:19-Rom14:21); [15:1–2](https://ref.ly/Rom15:1-Rom15:2); compare [Philippians 2:3–4](https://ref.ly/Phil2:3-Phil2:4)).

Paul concludes the discussion started in [8:1](https://ref.ly/1Cor8:1) with guidance on when Christians may eat meat offered to an idol and when they should not (see study note on 1 Corinthians 8:1–11:1). His guidance emphasizes the principle of giving up one's rights out of love (see also [8:13–9:23](https://ref.ly/1Cor8:13-1Cor9:23)).

## 1 Corinthians 10:27–29 (id: 13723)

When Christians are invited to a meal with a non\-believer, they can eat what is served unless told the meat was offered to an idol. In that case, Christians should not eat it to respect the other person's beliefs. The person might think eating the meat honors the idol (see [8:7](https://ref.ly/1Cor8:7), [9–10](https://ref.ly/1Cor8:9-1Cor8:10); compare [Romans 14:13–15](https://ref.ly/Rom14:13-Rom14:15), [20–23](https://ref.ly/Rom14:20-Rom14:23)).

These two questions are hard to understand in relation to [10:28–29a](https://ref.ly/1Cor10:28-1Cor10:29). Some translations place [10:28–29a](https://ref.ly/1Cor10:28-1Cor10:29) in parentheses, suggesting these questions reflect Paul’s beliefs, continuing from [10:27](https://ref.ly/1Cor10:27).

## 1 Corinthians 10:31–33 (id: 13727)

Paul ends his discussion by summarizing two principles to guide Christian behavior: 

1. Believers should do everything to honor God (see [Colossians 3:17](https://ref.ly/Col3:17); [1 Peter 4:11](https://ref.ly/1Pet4:11)).
2. Believers should avoid offending others and should not harm another person's Christian faith (compare [1 Corinthians 8:9](https://ref.ly/1Cor8:9), [13](https://ref.ly/1Cor8:13); [1 John 2:10](https://ref.ly/1John2:10)). Christians should prioritize what is best for others over personal privilege (compare [Romans 14:13–15](https://ref.ly/Rom14:13-Rom14:15), [19–21](https://ref.ly/Rom14:19-Rom14:21); [15:1–2](https://ref.ly/Rom15:1-Rom15:2)). These two principles are central to Paul's advice on practical Christian living in this letter.

## 1 Corinthians 11:3 (id: 13756)

*the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God*: The word *head* serves as a metaphor for either *source* or *authority*. The immediate context and Paul's overall teaching suggest that *head* means *authority* in this context (see [Genesis 3:16](https://ref.ly/Gen3:16); [Ephesians 5:21–23](https://ref.ly/Eph5:21-Eph5:23); [Colossians 3:18](https://ref.ly/Col3:18); [1 Peter 3:1](https://ref.ly/1Pet3:1)).

## 1 Corinthians 11:3–16 (id: 13752)

Paul discusses a woman's use of a head covering. He argues that women who pray or prophesy in public should wear a veil. This is to dress modestly and appropriately during worship (compare [1 Timothy 2:9](https://ref.ly/1Tim2:9); [1 Peter 3:3](https://ref.ly/1Pet3:3)). Some in Corinth were not wearing head coverings, citing freedom in Christ. Paul supports the custom based on social traditions, the Genesis creation story, and the presence of angels.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 11:3–1CO 11:16

## 1 Corinthians 11:4–6 (id: 13757)

* In this passage, *head* is used both literally and figuratively. A man who covers his physical head while praying dishonors his spiritual head, Christ. A woman who prays or prophesies without covering her physical head dishonors her spiritual head, her husband.
* The spiritual gift of prophesying is the God\-given ability to speak a specific message from God, not just to predict the future (see [12:10](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:10); [14:1–5](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:1-1Cor14:5); [1 Thessalonians 5:20](https://ref.ly/1Thess5:20)).

* After supper may suggest that the main meal separated the breaking of the bread from the drinking of the cup (see [Luke 22:20](https://ref.ly/Luke22:20)).
* The new covenant is God's promise to forgive sins because of Jesus' sacrificial death (compare [Jeremiah 31:31–34](https://ref.ly/Jer31:31-Jer31:34); [32:40](https://ref.ly/Jer32:40); [Luke 22:20](https://ref.ly/Luke22:20); [Hebrews 7:22](https://ref.ly/Heb7:22); [8:8–10](https://ref.ly/Heb8:8-Heb8:10); [9:15](https://ref.ly/Heb9:15); [10:12–18](https://ref.ly/Heb10:12-Heb10:18); [12:24](https://ref.ly/Heb12:24); [13:20](https://ref.ly/Heb13:20)). The blood of a sacrifice confirmed an agreement or covenant (see [Exodus 24:8](https://ref.ly/Exod24:8); [Zechariah 9:11](https://ref.ly/Zech9:11); [Hebrews 9:12](https://ref.ly/Heb9:12); [13:20](https://ref.ly/Heb13:20); compare [Romans 3:25](https://ref.ly/Rom3:25); [5:9](https://ref.ly/Rom5:9)).

When Christians take the Lord’s Supper, they share the importance of the Lord’s death with others until he returns (see [1:7–8](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:7-1Cor1:8); compare [1 Thessalonian 1:9–10](https://ref.ly/1Thess1:9-1Thess1:10); [3:12](https://ref.ly/1Thess3:12); [4:13–18](https://ref.ly/1Thess4:13-1Thess4:18); [5:23](https://ref.ly/1Thess5:23)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 11:26

Taking the Lord’s Supper without understanding its importance or with unconfessed sin is unworthy (see [11:28–31](https://ref.ly/1Cor11:28-1Cor11:31)). It is like sinning against the body and blood of the Lord; it treats his sacrificial death as unimportant (compare [Hebrews 10:29](https://ref.ly/Heb10:29)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 11:27

## 1 Corinthians 11:28 (id: 13749)

Before taking the Lord's Supper, Christians should confess their sins and think about what the bread and cup mean ([11:26](https://ref.ly/1Cor11:26)).

## 1 Corinthians 11:29–30 (id: 13750)

* In light of [11:27](https://ref.ly/1Cor11:27), the body of Christ likely refers to the death of Christ, not the church, though some interpret it that way.
* Those who eat the bread or drink the cup in an unworthy manner bring God's judgment upon themselves. This judgment may result in infirmities, sickness, or even death (see [Acts 5:5](https://ref.ly/Acts5:5), [10](https://ref.ly/Acts5:10)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 11:29–1CO 11:30

The church in Corinth focused too much on the gift of speaking in tongues (see [14:1–25](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:1-1Cor14:25), [27](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:27); compare the lists in [12:8–10](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:8-1Cor12:10), [28](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:28), where Paul lists tongues last).

Paul provides two ways to recognize the Spirit's presence in worship:

1. Those who curse Jesus show they reject him and his message, so they cannot speak by the Spirit of God.
2. Believers show the Holy Spirit's presence in their lives by sincerely confessing that Jesus is Lord. This may be the earliest Christian creed (see [Romans 10:9](https://ref.ly/Rom10:9), [13](https://ref.ly/Rom10:13); [2 Corinthians 4:5](https://ref.ly/2Cor4:5); [Philippians 2:11](https://ref.ly/Phil2:11); [1 John 4:2–3](https://ref.ly/1John4:2-1John4:3)).

The spiritual gift of great faith is different from the faith needed for salvation.

* Prophesying means delivering a special message from God, not just predicting the future (see [11:4–5](https://ref.ly/1Cor11:4-1Cor11:5); [13:2](https://ref.ly/1Cor13:2), [8](https://ref.ly/1Cor13:8); [14:1–25](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:1-1Cor14:25), [29–33](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:29-1Cor14:33); [1 Thessalonians 5:20](https://ref.ly/1Thess5:20); compare [Acts 13:1–2](https://ref.ly/Acts13:1-Acts13:2); [21:4](https://ref.ly/Acts21:4), [10–11](https://ref.ly/Acts21:10-Acts21:11)).
* The gift to discern if a message is from God's Spirit or another spirit is essential for any Christian community open to God's word (see [1 Corinthians 14:29](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:29); [1 Thessalonians 5:19–21](https://ref.ly/1Thess5:19-1Thess5:21); compare [Acts 16:16–18](https://ref.ly/Acts16:16-Acts16:18); [1 John 4:1–3](https://ref.ly/1John4:1-1John4:3)).
* For Paul, speaking in unknown languages means using a spiritual language that needs the gift of interpretation to be understood. By ranking this gift lower (both here and in [1 Corinthians 12:28](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:28)), Paul indicates that the gift of tongues is less important, as the Corinthian church had become overly fascinated with it (compare [13:1](https://ref.ly/1Cor13:1), [8](https://ref.ly/1Cor13:8); [14:1–25](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:1-1Cor14:25), [27](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:27)).
* The ability to interpret is not about translating with natural skill, but about spiritually understanding the Spirit's message through the gift of tongues (see [14:5](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:5), [13](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:13), [26–28](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:26-1Cor14:28)).

These verses shift from the image of a physical body to the image of the church as a spiritual body. Every part of the body is important and essential for it to work well. Believers should not brag about their spiritual roles or think less of them compared to others.

## 1 Corinthians 12:28–31 (id: 13768)

Paul describes various roles assigned to individuals in the church (see also the list in [12:8–10](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:8-1Cor12:10); compare [Romans 12:6–8](https://ref.ly/Rom12:6-Rom12:8); [Ephesians 4:11](https://ref.ly/Eph4:11)).

## 1 Corinthians 12:29–30 (id: 13770)

These rhetorical questions all expect the answer, "Of course not!" Paul gently corrects those who feel jealous of others. Believers should gratefully accept the gifts God has given them. They should not envy other gifts or consider any gifts more important than others (but see [12:31](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:31)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 12:29–1CO 12:30

## 1 Corinthians 12:31 (id: 13772)

* Believers should eagerly seek the most helpful gifts, those with the greatest potential to strengthen the church (see [14:12](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:12)). They should remember that God distributes gifts as he chooses ([12:11](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:11), [18](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:18), [28](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:28)). Paul encourages the Corinthians to look beyond their desire for the gift of tongues (compare [14:1–25](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:1-1Cor14:25), [27](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:27); see [12:10](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:10)) because it has the least potential to strengthen the church.
* *And now I will show you the most excellent way**:* This statement leads to Paul’s description of love in [13:1–13](https://ref.ly/1Cor13:1-1Cor13:13). Love is the best way of life.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 12:31

## 1 Corinthians 13:1 (id: 13784)

*tongues of men and of angels*: The Corinthians valued the spiritual gift of tongues the most (see also [12:10](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:10), [28](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:28); [14:1–25](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:1-1Cor14:25), [27](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:27)). Some believed tongues were the language of angels. In Acts, Luke uses the same term for natural human languages (see [Acts 2:4–13](https://ref.ly/Acts2:4-Acts2:13)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 13:1

## 1 Corinthians 13:1–3 (id: 13781)

Spiritual gifts do not determine our worth to God or the church. Without love, spiritual gifts have no value.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 13:1–1CO 13:3

## 1 Corinthians 13:1–13 (id: 13780)

Paul pauses his discussion of spiritual gifts (which he continues in chapter [14](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:1-1Cor14:40)) to stress that love is more important than any spiritual gift (see [8:1–3](https://ref.ly/1Cor8:1-1Cor8:3)). The most important goal for Christians is to become deeply and consistently loving individuals.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 13:1–1CO 13:13

## 1 Corinthians 13:2 (id: 13785)

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 13:2

## 1 Corinthians 13:3 (id: 13786)

* *exult in the surrender of my body*: Some manuscripts say *sacrificed my body to be burned.* A copyist could have easily changed the text by accident, as in Greek, the two readings differ by only one letter. It is unclear which reading is better. However, the manuscripts supporting the reading *exult in* instead of *sacrificed* are generally more reliable.
* *I gain nothing*: Even the most impressive sacrificial acts mean nothing if not motivated by love.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 13:3

## 1 Corinthians 13:4–7 (id: 13787)

This description of Christian love highlights the readiness to sacrifice personal desires for the benefit of others (see also [8:1–10:33](https://ref.ly/1Cor8:1-1Cor10:33); [Romans 5:6–8](https://ref.ly/Rom5:6-Rom5:8); [15:3](https://ref.ly/Rom15:3); [2 Corinthians 8:9](https://ref.ly/2Cor8:9); [Philippians 2:4–8](https://ref.ly/Phil2:4-Phil2:8)).

None of the spiritual gifts provides complete understanding. Unlike love, their benefits are limited.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 13:9

## 1 Corinthians 13:12 (id: 13782)

* The difference between now and the future is between this age and the coming age.
* Now, we see things imperfectly, like puzzling reflections in a mirror. In Paul's time, mirrors were usually made of polished bronze, so the view was unclear. Our perception in this life is limited, and our understanding is incomplete.
* Then, when the end comes and Christ establishes his eternal kingdom, we will see everything clearly. At that time, the spiritual gifts that provide knowledge will no longer be needed.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 13:12

## 1 Corinthians 13:13 (id: 13783)

Faith, hope, and love are more important than spiritual gifts because they last forever (see also [Romans 5:1–5](https://ref.ly/Rom5:1-Rom5:5); [Galatians 5:5–6](https://ref.ly/Gal5:5-Gal5:6); [Colossians 1:4–5](https://ref.ly/Col1:4-Col1:5); [1 Thessalonians 1:3](https://ref.ly/1Thess1:3); [5:8](https://ref.ly/1Thess5:8)). Of the three, the greatest is love*,* because love is the essential nature of God himself (see [1 John 4:7–12](https://ref.ly/1John4:7-1John4:12), [16–21](https://ref.ly/1John4:16-1John4:21)). Therefore, love should define our relationship with him and others.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 13:13

## 1 Corinthians 14:1 (id: 13798)

Among all the special abilities the Spirit provides (see study note on 1 Corinthians 12:1–14:40), Paul urges the Corinthians to seek the ability to prophesy because it benefits the church more (see [12:10](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:10)) .

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 14:1
* **Associated Articles:** 1 Corinthians 12:1-14.40 (ID: `13759@TyndaleStudyNotes`)

## 1 Corinthians 14:1–25 (id: 13792)

After highlighting the supreme importance of love (chapter [13](https://ref.ly/1Cor13:1-1Cor13:13)), Paul discusses spiritual gifts again. He defines their value by how much they help others, which reflects love (chapter [13](https://ref.ly/1Cor13:1-1Cor13:13)). With this in mind, Paul compares the overvalued gift of speaking in tongues with the more helpful gift of prophecy.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 14:1–1CO 14:25

## 1 Corinthians 14:2–4 (id: 13799)

The issue with speaking in tongues is that listeners cannot easily understand the message. However, the gift of prophecy is clear and helpful. It is a message from God that strengthens, encourages, and comforts those who hear it.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 14:2–1CO 14:4

## 1 Corinthians 14:4 (id: 13810)

The main purpose of spiritual gifts is to strengthen the whole church, not just to improve oneself (see [12:7](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:7); compare [8:1](https://ref.ly/1Cor8:1); [14:12](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:12)).

A message must be clear to communicate well.

## 1 Corinthians 14:13 (id: 13794)

Paul does not forbid speaking in tongues (see [14:39](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:39)), but interpreting is crucial, especially in public worship (see [14:27–28](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:27-1Cor14:28)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 14:13

## 1 Corinthians 14:14 (id: 13795)

Speaking in tongues involves the speaker's spirit, as the Holy Spirit speaks through them, but not their mind, since the message is not logically understandable.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 14:14

## 1 Corinthians 14:15–17 (id: 13796)

* It is better to worship with both spirit and understandable words. Public worship should bless God and others. Speaking in tongues without interpretation glorifies God and helps the speaker ([14:4](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:4)), but it does not help others present.
* *say “Amen” to your thanksgiving*: *Amen* was the traditional response to a prayer.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 14:15–1CO 14:17

## 1 Corinthians 14:18–19 (id: 13797)

Paul emphasized the personal benefit of speaking in tongues, but in a church meeting, it should benefit others, not just the speaker.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 14:18–1CO 14:19

## 1 Corinthians 14:20 (id: 13800)

To understand these matters maturely*,* consider the purpose of spiritual gifts. Do not treat them as ends for personal enjoyment.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 14:20

## 1 Corinthians 14:21–25 (id: 13801)

Paul used this quotation from [Isaiah 28:11–12](https://ref.ly/Isa28:11-Isa28:12) to show that speaking in tongues is a sign for unbelievers, not believers. However, in [1 Corinthians 14:23–25](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:23-1Cor14:25), Paul argues that unbelievers are more likely to be convinced by prophecy than by speaking in tongues. He emphasizes that, in public worship, prophecy is more useful than speaking in tongues.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 14:21–1CO 14:25

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 14:26

## 1 Corinthians 14:26–40 (id: 13803)

Paul provides clear instructions for using spiritual gifts in the church. He stresses the importance of expressing them in an orderly manner. In the early Christian community, church meetings were not led by professional pastors or priests. Instead, everyone shared what God had given them to strengthen the church.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 14:26–1CO 14:40

## 1 Corinthians 14:27–28 (id: 13805)

Paul advises a church eager for the gift of tongues to limit its public use. He suggests no more than two or three people should speak, one at a time, and only if someone can interpret the message.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 14:27–1CO 14:28

## 1 Corinthians 14:29–32 (id: 13806)

Public prophecy should be shared in an orderly manner, guided by the Spirit, so everyone benefits. Others should evaluate what is said to determine if it is truly a message from God ([1 Thessalonians 5:19–21](https://ref.ly/1Thess5:19-1Thess5:21)). Those with a prophecy should take turns. Although prophecy is a divinely given message, the speaker still controls it.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 14:29–1CO 14:32

## 1 Corinthians 14:34–35 (id: 13807)

* This part of the discussion on using spiritual gifts shows a view on women's roles similar to that of the Pastoral Letters (see [1 Timothy 2:11–15](https://ref.ly/1Tim2:11-1Tim2:15)).
* Paul advises women to be quiet and respectful in church meetings. We should understand this instruction considering [1 Corinthians 11:5](https://ref.ly/1Cor11:5), which clearly implies that women can pray and prophesy in public.
* *as the law says*: This possibly refers to [Genesis 3:16](https://ref.ly/Gen3:16).

## 1 Corinthians 15:8–9 (id: 13856)

* *as to one of untimely birth*: This phrase can refer to a miscarriage or stillbirth. Here it might describe the unusual way Paul converted, the negative view some opponents had of his role as an apostle, or his own feelings of unworthiness to be an apostle. The main focus is on God's extraordinary grace to Paul, who once persecuted Christ’s followers (see [Galatians 1:13](https://ref.ly/Gal1:13); [Philippians 3:6](https://ref.ly/Phil3:6); compare [Acts 8:3](https://ref.ly/Acts8:3); [9:1–2](https://ref.ly/Acts9:1-Acts9:2)).

If Christ did not rise from the dead, then the Christian faith is pointless. However, Jesus’ resurrection proves that His sacrifice completely atoned for human sins (see [15:3](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:3)). Without Christ's resurrection, people remain unforgiven and under God's judgment, still guilty of their sins (see [Romans 3:19](https://ref.ly/Rom3:19); [Ephesians 2:1–3](https://ref.ly/Eph2:1-Eph2:3)).
