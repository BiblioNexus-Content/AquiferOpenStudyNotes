## Jeremiah 1:1–19 (id: 17463)

Jeremiah's call is shown as a conversation. God spoke like a king to Jeremiah. Jeremiah's objections show he understood himself well. God answered his objections with promises and strong visions.

* **Associated Passages:** JER 1:1–JER 1:19

## Jeremiah 1:2–3 (id: 17469)

Jehoahaz and Jehoiachin are not on this list of kings. Each ruled for less than three months.

## Jeremiah 1:4–5 (id: 17470)

* In his first message from the Lord, Jeremiah learned three key truths about God:

    1. God knows everything, including each person.
        2. He can choose people for specific tasks even before they exist.
        3. He gives his authority to those he calls.
* God chose Jeremiah for a special task and made him a prophet.
* Jeremiah's work reached many nations. Although he left the kingdom of Judah only three times, people worldwide have heard or read his writings (see [Jeremiah 13:4–7](https://ref.ly/Jer13:4-Jer13:7); [43:7–8](https://ref.ly/Jer43:7-Jer43:8)).

Jeremiah was young (probably a teenager).

* **Associated Passages:** JER 1:6
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Jeremiah 1:7–8 (id: 17472)

God encouraged Jeremiah to focus on the importance of his task. He needed to meet God's standards for a royal messenger. This included being willing to travel and faithfully delivering God's messages.

* **Associated Passages:** JER 1:7–JER 1:8
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Jeremiah 1:9 (id: 17473)

When God put his words in Jeremiah's mouth, he made Jeremiah an official royal messenger. God gave him the authority to speak publicly on his behalf.

* **Associated Passages:** JER 1:9
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Jeremiah 1:11–12 (id: 17464)

The Hebrew words for "almond tree" (*shaqed*) and "watching" (*shoqed*) sound very similar. God used this connection to teach Jeremiah something important. The almond tree blooms very early, before other trees, in January or February. 

When God showed Jeremiah an almond tree, he was telling him that just as the almond tree is alert and ready to bloom early, God is always alert and watching over his people. We can see this same idea of God's constant watchful care in [Psalm 121:3–8](https://ref.ly/Ps121:3-Ps121:8).

* **Associated Passages:** JER 1:11–JER 1:12
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Jeremiah 1:13–14 (id: 17465)

Invading armies would bring terror to the people of Judah. Although Babylon was directly east of Judah, the desert between them forced the Babylonian army to attack Judah from the north. This invasion would be as destructive as rushing, boiling water

* **Associated Passages:** JER 1:13–JER 1:14
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Jeremiah 1:17 (id: 17466)

Jeremiah feared looking foolish as the Lord's messenger (see Jeremiah Book Introduction, “Literary Features: The Messenger System”). However, refusing God's command would be truly foolish.

* **Associated Passages:** JER 1:17
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Jeremiah 1:18 (id: 17467)

A well\-defended city could resist a siege for a long time, often until the attacking army left to handle another crisis in the empire.

* **Associated Passages:** JER 1:18
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Jeremiah 1:19 (id: 17468)

* **Associated Passages:** JER 1:19
* **Associated Articles:** Jeremiah 2:2 (ID: 17658)

## Jeremiah 2:1–13 (id: 17639)

Jeremiah used marriage, infidelity, and divorce as images to show Judah's spiritual betrayal.

* **Associated Passages:** JER 2:1–JER 2:13
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Jeremiah 2:2 (id: 17658)

* *this is what the LORD says*: Such statements were like an official seal or stamp of authority on a document. In many ancient Near Eastern royal messages, the ruler declared that the message was from him and had his authority.
* The image of Israel as a bride has been used since Hosea's time, about 760 to 722 BC ([Hosea 2:2–19](https://ref.ly/Hos2:2-Hos2:19); see also [Isaiah 54:6–8](https://ref.ly/Isa54:6-Isa54:8); [62:5](https://ref.ly/Isa62:5)). This idea is later applied to those living in heaven ([Revelation 19:7](https://ref.ly/Rev19:7); [21:2](https://ref.ly/Rev21:2), [9](https://ref.ly/Rev21:9)).
* *youth*: after the exodus from Egypt, the Israelites symbolically married God when they agreed to a covenant relationship ([Exodus 19:8](https://ref.ly/Exod19:8); [24:7](https://ref.ly/Exod24:7), [8](https://ref.ly/Exod24:8); [Deuteronomy 5:27](https://ref.ly/Deut5:27); [Ezekiel 16:8](https://ref.ly/Ezek16:8)).
* *devotion* (Hebrew *khesed*): The Israelites pledged loyalty to the covenant Lord (see [Deuteronomy 5:29](https://ref.ly/Deut5:29)).

* **Associated Passages:** JER 2:2
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Jeremiah 2:3 (id: 17665)

* Israel was holy because the Lord chose her to be his special people and show his character ([Exodus 19:5–6](https://ref.ly/Exod19:5-Exod19:6); [Leviticus 19](https://ref.ly/Lev19:1-Lev19:37); [22:31–33](https://ref.ly/Lev22:31-Lev22:33)).
* *the firstfruits of His harvest*: Mosaic law required people to give the first part of every harvest to the Lord ([Exodus 23:16](https://ref.ly/Exod23:16), [19](https://ref.ly/Exod23:19); [34:22](https://ref.ly/Exod34:22), [26](https://ref.ly/Exod34:26); [Leviticus 2:12](https://ref.ly/Lev2:12), [14](https://ref.ly/Lev2:14); [23:10](https://ref.ly/Lev23:10), [17](https://ref.ly/Lev23:17), [20](https://ref.ly/Lev23:20); [Numbers 18:12](https://ref.ly/Num18:12); [28:26](https://ref.ly/Num28:26); [Deuteronomy 18:4](https://ref.ly/Deut18:4); [26:10](https://ref.ly/Deut26:10); [Zechariah 14:20](https://ref.ly/Zech14:20)). The people who made the covenant with God at Mount Sinai promised their full commitment to the one true God. In return, the Lord protected them and punished their enemies during their journey to Canaan.

* **Associated Passages:** JER 2:3
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Jeremiah 2:5 (id: 17666)

The Israelites worshiped worthless idols*,* so delusions controlled their lives.

* **Associated Passages:** JER 2:5
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Jeremiah 2:6 (id: 17667)

By not seeking the Lord*,* Israel’s ancestors showed they had lost interest in their history. To them, the God of Israel was an illusion. They only cared about immediate pleasures.

* **Associated Passages:** JER 2:6
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Jeremiah 2:7 (id: 17668)

*defiled*...*detestable*: See [Deuteronomy 4:25–28](https://ref.ly/Deut4:25-Deut4:28).

* **Associated Passages:** JER 2:7
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Jeremiah 2:8 (id: 17669)

The leaders taught the people about Baal instead of teaching them about the Lord.

* **Associated Passages:** JER 2:8
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Jeremiah 2:9 (id: 17670)

* *Therefore* often means the Lord was about to make a decision (for example, [Jeremiah 5:14](https://ref.ly/Jer5:14); [6:21](https://ref.ly/Jer6:21)).
* The Hebrew word translated *bring a case* can mean "strive" or "contend." It might also suggest combat, like a fight, a verbal argument, or a legal case in court. Because the nation's leaders ([Jeremiah 2:8](https://ref.ly/Jer2:8)) did not guide the people to him, the Lord planned to present his case against them. He was creating a court where he would be both the plaintiff and the all\-powerful Judge ([Ezekiel 20:35](https://ref.ly/Ezek20:35), [36](https://ref.ly/Ezek20:36); [Micah 6:2](https://ref.ly/Mic6:2)). Jeremiah served as a messenger, prosecutor, and advocate for the plaintiff.

* **Associated Passages:** JER 2:9
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Jeremiah 2:10 (id: 17640)

Kedar*,* an Arabic tribe that came from Ishmael, lived in the desert east of the Jordan River Valley (see [Jeremiah 49:28–33](https://ref.ly/Jer49:28-Jer49:33); [Isaiah 21:16](https://ref.ly/Isa21:16)).

* **Associated Passages:** JER 2:10
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Jeremiah 2:11 (id: 17641)

No pagan nation exchanged its gods for those of another nation. Even though pagan nations generally worshiped the same nature deities (using different names), each nation stayed loyal to its own gods. This highlights Israel's disloyalty.

* **Associated Passages:** JER 2:11
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Jeremiah 2:12 (id: 17642)

The heavens and the earth often serve as witnesses to human events (see [Jeremiah 51:48](https://ref.ly/Jer51:48); [Deuteronomy 32:1](https://ref.ly/Deut32:1), [43](https://ref.ly/Deut32:43); [1 Chronicles 16:31](https://ref.ly/1Chr16:31); [Psalm 96:11](https://ref.ly/Ps96:11); [Isaiah 1:2](https://ref.ly/Isa1:2); [44:23](https://ref.ly/Isa44:23); [49:13](https://ref.ly/Isa49:13)).

* **Associated Passages:** JER 2:12
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Jeremiah 2:13 (id: 17643)

* The Israelites made two unwise choices:

    1. They left the Lord, their true source of life
        2. Thet started worshipping false gods that could not help them
* A fountain of living (running) water that flows all year, even during droughts, is a rare treasure ([Psalm 36:9](https://ref.ly/Ps36:9); [John 4:14](https://ref.ly/John4:14)).
* The cisterns the Israelites built after entering Canaan were holes in the ground lined with plaster. These simple tanks collected rainwater from roofs during wet weather and provided water during dry summers. The water could become stale and unsafe to drink, and the plaster often cracked, causing the water to leak out.

* **Associated Passages:** JER 2:13
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Jeremiah 2:14 (id: 17645)

The Israelites were freed from slavery in Egypt. However, in Jeremiah's time, they became slaves again due to their agreements with Egypt and Assyria ([Jeremiah 2:18](https://ref.ly/Jer2:18)).

* **Associated Passages:** JER 2:14
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Jeremiah 2:14–22 (id: 17644)

This review of Israel's history highlights the foolishness, violence, arrogance, and hopelessness of abandoning the true God to worship false pagan gods.

* **Associated Passages:** JER 2:14–JER 2:22
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Jeremiah 2:15 (id: 17646)

Jeremiah describes the Assyrians, who destroyed the northern kingdom ([2 Kings 17:5–23](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:5-2Kgs17:23); [Nahum 2:11–12](https://ref.ly/Nah2:11-Nah2:12)), as lions.

* **Associated Passages:** JER 2:15
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Jeremiah 2:16 (id: 17647)

* Another enemy, the Egyptians, invaded from the south to take advantage of the situation ([Jeremiah 50:17](https://ref.ly/Jer50:17); [2 Kings 23:29–37](https://ref.ly/2Kgs23:29-2Kgs23:37)).
* Memphis and Tahpanhes, Egypt’s major cities near the mouth of the Nile, were famous for their wealth.

* **Associated Passages:** JER 2:16
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Jeremiah 2:18 (id: 17648)

Israel's alliances with Egypt and agreements with Assyria ([2 Kings 15:19–19:37](https://ref.ly/2Kgs15:19-2Kgs19:37)) brought only sorrow, not benefits. Neither the Nile in Egypt nor the Euphrates in Assyria ever helped Israel ([Isaiah 30:1–3](https://ref.ly/Isa30:1-Isa30:3); [Hosea 5:13](https://ref.ly/Hos5:13)).

* **Associated Passages:** JER 2:18
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Jeremiah 2:19 (id: 17649)

The choice to leave the Lord led to more punishment and shame for Israel's people ([Isaiah 3:9](https://ref.ly/Isa3:9); [Hosea 5:5](https://ref.ly/Hos5:5)).

* **Associated Passages:** JER 2:19
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Jeremiah 2:20–21 (id: 17650)

* *long ago*: Lessons from Israel's history about the Israelites' rescue from slavery in Egypt had little impact. The people of Israel refused to serve God ([Exodus 19:8](https://ref.ly/Exod19:8); [34:15](https://ref.ly/Exod34:15); [Leviticus 26:13](https://ref.ly/Lev26:13); [Deuteronomy 12:2](https://ref.ly/Deut12:2); [Joshua 24:16](https://ref.ly/Josh24:16); [Judges 10:16](https://ref.ly/Judg10:16); [Isaiah 57:5](https://ref.ly/Isa57:5), [7](https://ref.ly/Isa57:7)).
* *you lay down as a prostitute*: This metaphor was fitting for the Israelites bowing to idols. Their defiant words matched their rebellious actions. They often worshiped fertility gods, hoping for good crops and green pastures. Their rituals were pointless because the Lord planted the Israelites in Canaan and creates life and fertility.

* **Associated Passages:** JER 2:20–JER 2:21
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Jeremiah 2:22 (id: 17651)

The metaphor shifts from a planted vine to a dirty cloth that soap or lye cannot clean. No matter how hard the Israelites scrubbed, their guilt remained visible (compare [Isaiah 1:18](https://ref.ly/Isa1:18)).

* **Associated Passages:** JER 2:22
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Jeremiah 2:23 (id: 17653)

The people denied being Baal worshipers (compare [Jeremiah 2:25](https://ref.ly/Jer2:25)). Archaeologists have found small plaques depicting Asherah, a female goddess, and a male god resembling Baal. However, the inscriptions on these plaques bear the name of the Lord (*Yahweh*). Sometimes, Baal worship was disguised as worship of Israel's God.

* **Associated Passages:** JER 2:23
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Jeremiah 2:23–3.5 (id: 17652)

Israel did not act like a loyal wife. Instead, she acted like: 

* A wild animal in heat ([Jeremiah 2:23–25](https://ref.ly/Jer2:23-Jer2:25))
* A thief ([Jeremiah 2:26–30](https://ref.ly/Jer2:26-Jer2:30))
* A prostitute ([Jeremiah 2:31–3:5](https://ref.ly/Jer2:31-Jer3:5))

* **Associated Passages:** JER 2:23–JER 3:5
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Jeremiah 2:25 (id: 17654)

The Israelites admitted to worshipping Baal, which they had previously denied ([Jeremiah 2:23](https://ref.ly/Jer2:23)), showing their true feelings.

* **Associated Passages:** JER 2:25
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Jeremiah 2:26 (id: 17655)

Israel’s leaders did not feel ashamed for their wrongdoings. Any regret they showed during God’s punishment came from selfishness, not true repentance ([Psalm 78:34–37](https://ref.ly/Ps78:34-Ps78:37)).

* **Associated Passages:** JER 2:26
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Jeremiah 2:27 (id: 17656)

* These idols of a father and mother likely represented Baal and Asherah.
* *in the time of trouble, they say*: See, for example, [Judges 10:10](https://ref.ly/Judg10:10); [Isaiah 26:16](https://ref.ly/Isa26:16); [Hosea 5:15](https://ref.ly/Hos5:15).

* The Israelites unwisely worshipped many gods ([Jeremiah 11:13](https://ref.ly/Jer11:13); [Deuteronomy 32:37](https://ref.ly/Deut32:37); [Judges 10:14](https://ref.ly/Judg10:14); [2 Kings 17:30–31](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:30-2Kgs17:31)), who could not help them.

* **Associated Articles:** 

## Jeremiah 2:31 (id: 17660)

The Lord's anger became a plea. He asked why the Israelites saw life in obedience to him as a barren wasteland of death and lack ([Numbers 21:5](https://ref.ly/Num21:5)), filled with evil and the fear of darkness ([Job 24:17](https://ref.ly/Job24:17); [1 John 1:5–6](https://ref.ly/1John1:5-1John1:6)).

* **Associated Passages:** JER 2:31

## Jeremiah 2:32 (id: 17661)

For centuries, the Israelites had forgotten the Lord, who was like their husband ([Jeremiah 13:25](https://ref.ly/Jer13:25); [Psalm 106:21](https://ref.ly/Ps106:21); [Hosea 8:14](https://ref.ly/Hos8:14)).

* **Associated Passages:** JER 2:32
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Jeremiah 2:33–34 (id: 17662)

The Israelites made plans with their "lovers" , their neighbor who had strong armies, by forming treaties for protection. God had already promised them protection. God saw this as an act of betrayal that tainted Israel's character. Like their pagan neighbors, Israel harmed its own innocent and poor people ([Jeremiah 7:6](https://ref.ly/Jer7:6); [2 Kings 21:16](https://ref.ly/2Kgs21:16); [24:4](https://ref.ly/2Kgs24:4)).

* **Associated Passages:** JER 2:33–JER 2:34
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Jeremiah 2:35 (id: 17663)

Israel's sinful state was clear in the people's arrogant response. They claimed innocence and said God was angry without reason. God replied to their denial by declaring He would punish them severely and not accept their refusal to admit wrongdoing ([Proverbs 23:13](https://ref.ly/Prov23:13); [Malachi 2:17](https://ref.ly/Mal2:17); [3:8](https://ref.ly/Mal3:8); [1 John 1:8](https://ref.ly/1John1:8), [10](https://ref.ly/1John1:10)).

## Jeremiah 2:36 (id: 17664)

Judah, in its unfaithfulness to the Lord, chose unreliable allies. The leaders sought political help from neighbors like Egypt, which was as false a friend as Assyria had been a century earlier.

* **Associated Passages:** JER 2:36
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Jeremiah 3:1 (id: 17830)

The law forbade a man from remarrying a woman he had divorced if she married another man afterward ([Deuteronomy 24:1–4](https://ref.ly/Deut24:1-Deut24:4)). A woman with many lovers was even less likely to be accepted back.

* **Associated Passages:** JER 3:1
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Jeremiah 3:1–5 (id: 17819)

Adultery was a valid reason for divorce ([Deuteronomy 24:1–2](https://ref.ly/Deut24:1-Deut24:2); [Hosea 2:1–5](https://ref.ly/Hos2:1-Hos2:5); [9:1](https://ref.ly/Hos9:1)). Judah committed spiritual adultery, arrogantly assuming that God would not object ([Ezekiel 16:26](https://ref.ly/Ezek16:26); [Zechariah 1:3](https://ref.ly/Zech1:3)).

* **Associated Passages:** JER 3:1–JER 3:5

## Jeremiah 3:2 (id: 17834)

As the Lord's bride (see [Jeremiah 2:2](https://ref.ly/Jer2:2)), Israel was not supposed to worship other gods.

* **Associated Articles:** 

## Jeremiah 3:3 (id: 17835)

The Lord did not approve of the people's shameless behavior. He had already caused a drought, and their sexual rituals could not stop it ([Jeremiah 14:3–6](https://ref.ly/Jer14:3-Jer14:6); [Leviticus 26:19](https://ref.ly/Lev26:19); [Zephaniah 3:5](https://ref.ly/Zeph3:5)).

* **Associated Passages:** JER 3:3
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Jeremiah 3:4–5 (id: 17836)

Instead of confessing their sins, the people tried to hide them with sweet talk. However, God saw through their deception. They were right that he would not be angry forever ([Psalm 103:9](https://ref.ly/Ps103:9); [Isaiah 57:16](https://ref.ly/Isa57:16); [Malachi 1:6](https://ref.ly/Mal1:6)), but he promised to show his wrath ([Jeremiah 4:7](https://ref.ly/Jer4:7)).

* **Associated Passages:** JER 3:4–JER 3:5
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Jeremiah 3:6–10 (id: 17837)

* The Lord had been calling the kingdom of Judah "Israel" ([Jeremiah 2:1–3:5](https://ref.ly/Jer2:1-Jer3:5)), highlighting their identity as His people. Now, the Lord differentiates between Israel, the northern kingdom that was destroyed ([2 Kings 17](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:1-2Kgs17:41)), and the kingdom of Judah. The people of the southern kingdom did not learn from the northern kingdom's downfall, so they were destined to face the same fate.
* Josiah, who reigned from 640 to 609 BC, encouraged a return to traditional faith and practices in 621 BC ([2 Chronicles 34:29–33](https://ref.ly/2Chr34:29-2Chr34:33)).

* **Associated Passages:** JER 3:6–JER 3:10
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Jeremiah 3:7–8 (id: 17838)

King Josiah's reforms did not impact many common people. Idol worship, popular in northern Israel, also persisted among Judah's farmers and shepherds. They did not learn from the northern tribes' fate and even exceeded their practice of adultery (see [Ezekiel 16:47–48](https://ref.ly/Ezek16:47-Ezek16:48)).

*defiled the land*: Because Israel turned away from their faith, fertile fields stopped producing crops, and sheep did not graze on green grass ([Isaiah 57:6](https://ref.ly/Isa57:6)).

* **Associated Passages:** JER 3:9
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Jeremiah 3:10 (id: 17820)

Like the northern tribes of Israel, the people of Judah did not see idol worship as immoral. They ignored the Lord’s objections. The people did not truly repent; they only pretended under Josiah’s authority ([2 Chronicles 34:32](https://ref.ly/2Chr34:32)). Their religion was full of deception ([Jeremiah 12:2](https://ref.ly/Jer12:2); [Hosea 7:14](https://ref.ly/Hos7:14)).

* **Associated Passages:** JER 3:10

## Jeremiah 3:11–4.2 (id: 17821)

The Lord asked Israel to repent, return, and reconcile with him (contrast [Jeremiah 2:1–3:10](https://ref.ly/Jer2:1-Jer3:10)). Israel had sinned and faced punishment. Now, the people of Judah sinned even more openly than their northern relatives, ignoring the lesson the Lord taught Israel ([Ezekiel 16:51–52](https://ref.ly/Ezek16:51-Ezek16:52)). However, it was still not too late to repent and become the blessing to the nations ([Jeremiah 4:1–2](https://ref.ly/Jer4:1-Jer4:2)) that God intended them to be ([Genesis 12:3](https://ref.ly/Gen12:3)).

* **Associated Articles:** 

## Jeremiah 3:12 (id: 17822)

In this decree, the Lord invites the survivors of unfaithful Israel from a century ago to return home. God's unchanging character is merciful, and He wants to offer salvation and restoration ([Jeremiah 12:15](https://ref.ly/Jer12:15); [31:20](https://ref.ly/Jer31:20); [33:26](https://ref.ly/Jer33:26); [2 Kings 17:6](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:6); [Psalm 86:15](https://ref.ly/Ps86:15)).

*As surely as the Lord lives*: When offering a prayer of confession and making oaths, the right attitude shows truth, justice, and righteousness. 

* *Truth* means that the thoughts and feelings of those praying match their words.
* *Justice* means living by the Lord's laws, as He will judge the earth.
* *Righteousness* means treating others according to the Lord’s Spirit and His moral standards.

* **Associated Articles:** 

## Jeremiah 6:2–5 (id: 18261)

Jeremiah described the commanding officers of the invading army as shepherds leading their soldiers to camp around the city. The initial plan was to strike the city walls at noon, when the attackers could see their work. However, the people in the city were so weakened that a night attack was just as effective (see [2 Kings 25:1–4](https://ref.ly/2Kgs25:1-2Kgs25:4)).

## Jeremiah 6:10–15 (id: 18251)

Jeremiah, the messenger and prosecutor, used rhetorical questions to show his love for the people. He was shocked when they responded with scorn. After showing evidence of sins by all levels of society, the prophet delivered a divine decree. The use of future tense in his indictment suggests he spoke before the invasion.

The people were so driven by greed that they sought profit through violence (see [Proverbs 1:11–19](https://ref.ly/Prov1:11-Prov1:19); also [Isaiah 56:11](https://ref.ly/Isa56:11); [Micah 3:5](https://ref.ly/Mic3:5), [11](https://ref.ly/Mic3:11)). The religious leaders were dishonest; they did not act according to their roles.

* **Associated Passages:** JER 6:13

The sinful behavior of God's people led to a serious problem that justified God's judgment. Instead of urging repentance, the religious leaders falsely promised peace ([Jeremiah 23:17](https://ref.ly/Jer23:17); [Ezekiel 13:10](https://ref.ly/Ezek13:10)).

## Jeremiah 6:22–30 (id: 18264)

This conversation between Jeremiah and the Lord likely occurred at the start of the Babylonian invasion in 605 BC. In these three poems, Jeremiah shares the Lord’s message ([Jeremiah 6:22–23](https://ref.ly/Jer6:22-Jer6:23)), connects with his people's fear, and urges them to repent quickly ([6:24–26](https://ref.ly/Jer6:24-Jer6:26)).

The Lord stopped Jeremiah's lament and reminded him of his mission. God compared the prophet to a silversmith working with raw ore. The refining process would show that the silver content was too small to be valuable.

Pagans believed a symbol was the same as what it represented. In Jeremiah's time, people thought the temple was God's heavenly house. They found it absurd to think enemies could destroy it. To support this belief, they repeatedly chanted, *This is the temple of the LORD*. However, the Lord of Hosts did not need an earthly house ([2 Samuel 7:6–7](https://ref.ly/2Sam7:6-2Sam7:7); [1 Kings 8:27](https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:27)). The Israelites' security from the Temple came from the Lord himself, and only on his terms ([1 Kings 6:12](https://ref.ly/1Kgs6:12)).

Idol worship harmed the people in several ways. Spiritually, idols were illusions. Socially, idol worship ruined their community bonds. Politically, it made them overconfident against foreign armies. Without change, they had no future in the Promised Land ([Exodus 22:21–24](https://ref.ly/Exod22:21-Exod22:24); [Deuteronomy 4:40](https://ref.ly/Deut4:40); [6:14–15](https://ref.ly/Deut6:14-Deut6:15)).

Shiloh was a hill located between Shechem and Jerusalem. After Joshua led the conquest of Canaan, the Israelites set up the Tabernacle there ([Joshua 18:1](https://ref.ly/Josh18:1), [6–19](https://ref.ly/Josh18:6-Josh18:19); [Judges 18:31](https://ref.ly/Judg18:31)). It served as the center of worship for the Israelite tribes until the Philistine army destroyed Shiloh around 1045 BC (see [Jeremiah 26:6](https://ref.ly/Jer26:6); [Psalm 78:60](https://ref.ly/Ps78:60)).

God allowed the Philistines to capture the Ark of the Covenant and destroy the Tabernacle at Shiloh. The people had tried to use the Ark as a magical object ([1 Samuel 4:1–11](https://ref.ly/1Sam4:1-1Sam4:11)). Similarly, he would allow the Babylonians to destroy the Temple.

The people's offerings and sacrifices meant nothing to the Lord if they were disobedient. Their sacrifices could not force God to act against His will. Instead, these offerings showed the people's trust in God's forgiveness. When people tried to use sacrifices to manipulate God while living selfishly, it only angered Him ([Isaiah 1:10216](https://ref.ly/Isa1:10-Isa1:16); [Amos 5:21–27](https://ref.ly/Amos5:21-Amos5:27)).

The valley of Ben\-Hinnom started on the west side of Jerusalem and continued around the south side. This narrow, steep valley opened into the Kidron Valley and served as the city's garbage dump and graveyard. The bodies of the poor, whether murdered or dead from disease, were dumped there. Child sacrifice, a practice completely abhorrent to the Lord (see [2 Chronicles 28:3](https://ref.ly/2Chr28:3); [33:6](https://ref.ly/2Chr33:6)), also took place there. The valley was known as Topheth ([2 Kings 23:10](https://ref.ly/2Kgs23:10); [Isaiah 30:33](https://ref.ly/Isa30:33)), possibly referring to ritual drums (Hebrew *top*) or sacrificial fires (*tap*) used there. 

In the New Testament, it is called Gehenna, and Jesus compared hell to the fire that burned continuously in that valley (see study note on Matthew 5:29). Soon, it would be known as the Valley of Slaughter because the siege and destruction of Jerusalem, which lasted from 588 to 586 BC, would fill the valley with the bodies of the slain.

The priests in the Temple memorized and repeated prayers as part of their rituals. They believed using the exact words was crucial; otherwise, the prayers lost their magical power.

The Lord answered the questions ([Jeremiah 9:12](https://ref.ly/Jer9:12)) by repeating his earlier words. The people caused the destruction of the city, towns, and land. They rejected the Lord’s covenant instructions and deliberately disobeyed his commands. They became devoted idol worshipers because their ancestors taught them to worship images of Baal, the Canaanite god of storms and fertility.

## Jeremiah 9:24 (id: 18318)

* The Lord values only one type of boast—the testimony of those who truly know and understand that He is the one true God ([1 Corinthians 1:31](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:31); [2 Corinthians 10:17](https://ref.ly/2Cor10:17)).
* *loving devotion*: This important covenant term (Hebrew *khesed*) means passionate loyalty. It is often undeserved and can be translated as “mercy,” “grace,” “kindness,” or love. It is the Old Testament equivalent of the New Testament statement that “God is love” ([1 John 4:8](https://ref.ly/1John4:8)).
* *righteousness*: God interacts with His people on an ethical, moral level. He does what is right in every situation.
* *I delight in these things*: God does not enjoy judging and punishing sinners. Instead, He actively seeks to save them.

* **Associated Passages:** JER 9:24

* Because arrogance and sin controlled the nation, the Lord would soon announce a punishment.
* The Hebrew practice of circumcision began with Abraham ([Genesis 17:10–14](https://ref.ly/Gen17:10-Gen17:14)). Over time, this ritual became so linked with being God's chosen people that the Israelites believed it ensured a lasting bond with the Lord. However, physical circumcision is not enough; a person must also be spiritually circumcised—fully turning away from idol worship and dedicating themselves to making the Lord the focus of their life and actions ([Romans 2:25–29](https://ref.ly/Rom2:25-Rom2:29)).

The Egyptians lived southwest, on both sides of the Nile River. The Edomites lived south and southeast of Judah. The Ammonites lived east of the Jordan River. The Moabites lived east of the Dead Sea. These nations practiced circumcision, but their hearts were not circumcised (they did not follow their beliefs sincerely) because they worshiped many false gods.

## Jeremiah 10:1 (id: 17485)

As usual, Jeremiah identified the source of his message. He urged his audience not just to hear, but to pay close attention to the word of the Lord. In Hebrew thought, a person who does not respond has not truly heard.

This poetic passage criticizes idol worship and affirms the unity and majesty of the one true God. It is not a logical discussion of divinity in nature or a detailed statement about God's attributes.

The carved image had no beauty or value by itself. People had to add gold and silver to make it impressive (see [Jeremiah 10:9](https://ref.ly/Jer10:9)). Similarly, the image could not stand on its own. It needed to be secured to a foundation with a hammer and nails.

The people who made idols had to get metal from far away. They bought silver from Tarshish in southern Spain. They purchased gold from Uphaz (or *Ophir*) in Arabia. Skilled craftsmen and expert tailors worked hard to turn a worthless piece of wood or stone into an attractive artifact (see [Jeremiah 10:4–5](https://ref.ly/Jer10:4-Jer10:5)).

Pagan gods are not alive or permanent. People can destroy them or place them in museums. Stories about these idols often show them behaving immorally.

This statement challenged the core of Baal, the Canaanite god of storm and fertility. The Canaanites believed Baal was the thunder and rain. However, the Lord claimed them as his creations ([Psalm 135:5–7](https://ref.ly/Ps135:5-Ps135:7)), through which he could speak and even roar ([Job 37:2–5](https://ref.ly/Job37:2-Job37:5)).

The Lord reminded Jeremiah of several messages ([Exodus 19:5](https://ref.ly/Exod19:5)) that had formed the foundation of the relationship between the Lord and Israel for many centuries.

The Egyptians knew how to smelt iron. However, the iron\-smelting furnace of Egypt symbolized the Israelites’ slavery there. The Lord rescued them from this slavery. God also promised to be their unique God if they would be his unique people ([Exodus 6:7](https://ref.ly/Exod6:7)).

The Lord told Jeremiah not to cry or pray for the people of Jerusalem (see [Jeremiah 7:16](https://ref.ly/Jer7:16)). The Lord would not listen to their prayers. Since the people were dedicated to worshiping Baal, any prayer they offered would be insincere.

The Lord warned Jeremiah during his commissioning ([Jeremiah 1:19](https://ref.ly/Jer1:19)) that opposition would threaten his life. Jeremiah felt like a lamb led to slaughter, powerless to resist. This opposition happened before Jeremiah's trial in the Temple courtyard, early in Jehoiakim's reign (between 608 and 605 BC; see [Jeremiah 26](https://ref.ly/Jer26:1-Jer26:24)).

To experience God's compassion ([Jeremiah 12:15](https://ref.ly/Jer12:15)), people from other nations needed to stop worshiping idols and learn God's ways.

God told Jeremiah to keep a linen loincloth unwashed to represent Judah's unrighteousness (compare [Isaiah 64:5](https://ref.ly/Isa64:5); [Revelation 19:8](https://ref.ly/Rev19:8)). This garment is similar to modern\-day underwear.

The Lord instructed Jeremiah to perform a parable (see also [Jeremiah 18](https://ref.ly/Jer18:1-Jer18:23), [19](https://ref.ly/Jer19:1-Jer19:15), [27](https://ref.ly/Jer27:1-Jer27:22); see “Prophetic Sign Acts” Theme Note). This parable combined actions with words to highlight key aspects of the Lord’s response to Judah’s rebellion. Jeremiah struggled to fully understand the severe consequences of rejecting the Lord’s command for the people to worship him as the one true God. The direct relationship between Jeremiah and the Lord provided the basis for this event.

The king was likely Jehoiakim's son, Jehoiachin, who became king in 597 BC after his father's death. His mother was Nehushta (see [2 Kings 24:1–9](https://ref.ly/2Kgs24:1-2Kgs24:9)). Jehoiachin was eighteen years old and ruled for only three months. This message was probably given during his brief reign. The Babylonians would soon take his crowns (see [2 Kings 24:11–16](https://ref.ly/2Kgs24:11-2Kgs24:16)). They would also seize the treasures of the Temple and palace. The royalty and elite of Judah would be taken into exile. Meanwhile, Judah's southern neighbors would capture the towns of the Negev, the desert area from Beersheba to the Gulf of Aqaba.

For the third time (see [Jeremiah 7:16](https://ref.ly/Jer7:16); [11:14](https://ref.ly/Jer11:14)), God told Jeremiah not to pray for the people of Judah and Jerusalem. Fasting would be pointless because the Lord had decided to ignore them. The priests' burnt and grain offerings, which the Lord had given Moses as a way to worship him (see [Leviticus 1–2](https://ref.ly/Lev1:1-Lev2:16)), would be wasted because the Lord would not accept them. Instead, the Lord would respond with war, famine, and disease.

Jehoiachin had seven sons (see [1 Chronicles 3:17](https://ref.ly/1Chr3:17)), but people called him childless because none of his sons became king of Judah. His uncle Zedekiah later ruled as king of Judah. However, many Israelites considered Jehoiachin the last true king of David's dynasty (see study note on Ezekiel 1:2).

A righteous descendant from King David's line, whose rule had paused, would become a King.

This ruler would be called The Lord Our Righteousness (Hebrew *Yahweh Tsidqenu*). This name is an interesting reversal of Zedekiah’s Hebrew name (*Tsidqiyyahu*), which means “Righteous is the Lord.” Zedekiah’s character and the chaos during his reign were the opposite of the future King's character. The future King's reign would bring salvation and safety.

God gave Nebuchadnezzar control over the entire region, so resisting him was pointless. All nations would serve him and his descendants. Cyrus conquered Babylon in 539 BC during Belshazzar's reign, who was Nebuchadnezzar's grandson.

        + Interpreters of dreams predicted the future by explaining people's dreams
        + Mediums claimed to talk to dead people
        + Sorcerers cast spells to harm or bless people by saying certain words or phrases
* *You will not serve the king of Babylon*:  This prediction was incorrect. Nebuchadnezzar conquered the entire region starting in 605 BC.

Shortly after the events of [Jeremiah 27](https://ref.ly/Jer27:1-Jer27:22), a false prophet named Hananiah publicly challenged Jeremiah in the Temple courtyard. Each prophet claimed to deliver a message from the Lord, but only Jeremiah's prediction was accurate.

Jeremiah delivered the Lord's response to the false prophecy. Hananiah broke a wooden yoke, but it was replaced by a symbolic iron yoke. Submission to Babylon was certain because the Lord had decreed it.

Jeremiah's prophecy proved true when fulfilled two months later. In contrast, Hananiah's prediction that the Temple treasures would return in two years did not come true.

The exiled people of Judah would stay in Babylon for seventy years*;* this was not new information (see [Jeremiah 25:11](https://ref.ly/Jer25:11)), but Jeremiah's audiences in Jerusalem had not believed him. Now that they were in exile, they needed to accept reality.

A prophet in Babylon named Shemaiah disagreed with Jeremiah's advice that the exiles should accept a long exile ([Jeremiah 29:4–23](https://ref.ly/Jer29:4-Jer29:23)). Shemaiah sent a letter to a leading priest in Jerusalem, urging action against Jeremiah. In response, Jeremiah wrote a letter to the exiles condemning Shemaiah.

Shemaiah did not have a commission from the Lord, so he was a liar. He tried to convince the exiles that their exile would be short. Using the Lord's authority three times (see study note on Jeremiah 2:2), Shemaiah was charged, found guilty, and sentenced to execution.

This series of messages is mostly positive, with only two verses having a judgmental tone ([Jeremiah 30:23–24](https://ref.ly/Jer30:23-Jer30:24)). They describe the positive outcomes of Jerusalem's destruction and the Exile.

The fall of Jerusalem and the Exile did not end the Lord's relationship with Israel. The Lord planned a bright future for the remaining people. Descendants of those from the northern kingdom of Israel, exiled by the Assyrians in 722 BC, would return. Similarly, descendants of Judah's people, exiled to Babylon in 597 and 586 BC, would come back to the Promised Land.
* *I will restore them to the land*: The first major return from exile happened in 538 BC ([Ezra 1:1–6:22](https://ref.ly/Ezra1:1-Ezra6:22)), the second in 458 BC ([Ezra 7:1–10:44](https://ref.ly/Ezra7:1-Ezra10:44)), and the third in 445 BC ([Nehemiah 1–13](https://ref.ly/Neh1:1-Neh13:31)).

The old covenant was external and legal, while the new covenant would be a personal relationship. The new covenant would focus on changing and transforming a person's spiritual nature.

* The old covenant had to be taught (see [Deuteronomy 6:4–9](https://ref.ly/Deut6:4-Deut6:9)), but the new covenant focuses on a personal relationship with the Lord.
* *I will forgive*: Each believer who repents will experience God's forgiveness.
* *I...**will remember their sins no more*: Once sins are forgiven, they will not lead to divine judgment (see [Hebrews 10:17](https://ref.ly/Heb10:17)).
* Jesus’ death started the new covenant (see [Matthew 26:28](https://ref.ly/Matt26:28); [Mark 14:24](https://ref.ly/Mark14:24); [Luke 22:20](https://ref.ly/Luke22:20); [1 Corinthians 11:25](https://ref.ly/1Cor11:25); [2 Corinthians 3:6](https://ref.ly/2Cor3:6); [Hebrews 8](https://ref.ly/Heb8:1-Heb8:13); [9:15](https://ref.ly/Heb9:15); [12:22–24](https://ref.ly/Heb12:22-Heb12:24)).

Jeremiah had already predicted that the exile would last for seventy years ([Jeremiah 25:11–12](https://ref.ly/Jer25:11-Jer25:12); [29:10](https://ref.ly/Jer29:10)).

Jeremiah was still confused about the Lord’s command to buy the field ([Jeremiah 32:8](https://ref.ly/Jer32:8)). The Babylonian army would control that field, and Jeremiah used his savings to buy it.

This city was built during the reigns of David and Solomon, when Jerusalem became Israel's capital. In the northern kingdom of Israel, every king promoted the worship of false gods. In Judah, only a few kings encouraged worship of the Lord, but their efforts usually did not last (e.g., [2 Chronicles 14:3](https://ref.ly/2Chr14:3); [17:6](https://ref.ly/2Chr17:6); [29:5](https://ref.ly/2Chr29:5); [33:15–16](https://ref.ly/2Chr33:15-2Chr33:16); [34:3](https://ref.ly/2Chr34:3), [31–32](https://ref.ly/2Chr34:31-2Chr34:32)). The northern kingdom was already destroyed ([2 Kings 17:5–12](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:5-2Kgs17:12)), and now the Lord decided to remove the southern kingdom of Judah (see [Deuteronomy 8:19–20](https://ref.ly/Deut8:19-Deut8:20)).

Zedekiah told the people to free their slaves. He wanted to gain favor with God by following the covenant rules about Hebrew slave ownership ([Exodus 21:2–4](https://ref.ly/Exod21:2-Exod21:4)). These rules had been ignored since Moses' time. However, the order was useless because the people soon broke this new promise. They had also broken their agreement with Nebuchadnezzar (see [Ezekiel 21:23–24](https://ref.ly/Ezek21:23-Ezek21:24)) and their original covenant with the Lord.

The Lord gave the people of Judah many chances to repent. God wanted the messages of judgment to not only alarm them but also to make them aware of the consequences of idol worship.

To die without heirs or a proper burial was considered the worst fate (see [Jeremiah 22:19](https://ref.ly/Jer22:19); [Ecclesiastes 6:3](https://ref.ly/Eccl6:3)). Jehoiakim’s son, Jehoiachin, ruled for only three months. Unlike his father, Jehoiachin heeded Jeremiah’s warning and surrendered to the Babylonians. They took him and others to Babylon as captives ([Jeremiah 22:24–30](https://ref.ly/Jer22:24-Jer22:30); [2 Kings 24:8–16](https://ref.ly/2Kgs24:8-2Kgs24:16)).

These chapters describe meetings between Zedekiah and Jeremiah, highlighting Zedekiah’s struggle to fully commit to God's word (compare [Deuteronomy 10:12–13](https://ref.ly/Deut10:12-Deut10:13)). Zedekiah is a classic example of a person with divided loyalty ([James 1:6–8](https://ref.ly/Jas1:6-Jas1:8)).

## Jeremiah 37:6–10 (id: 17989)

The Lord answered Jeremiah’s prayer ([Jeremiah 37:3](https://ref.ly/Jer37:3)) with a warning for Zedekiah. The Egyptians would not offer lasting help, and the Babylonians would return to destroy Jerusalem. This prophecy came true in 586 BC.

The king asked Jeremiah about other messages from the Lord, showing his fear of the future. He still hoped the Lord would defeat the Babylonians. Jeremiah quickly and firmly said there was no hope for divine intervention like the one that destroyed the Assyrian army during Hezekiah’s reign ([2 Kings 19:8–37](https://ref.ly/2Kgs19:8-2Kgs19:37)).

* **Associated Passages:** JER 37:17

The steep slopes of the Kidron Valley on the east and the Ben\-Hinnom Valley on the west and south of Jerusalem forced the Babylonian army to focus their forces to the north.

* The Judean refugees thought they had freedom. They believed obeying the Lord meant being in bondage, while pagan worship led to fulfillment.
* The Queen of Heaven had many names across the ancient Near East. In Assyria and Babylon, she was "Ishtar," and the Canaanites called her "Astarte." In the Old Testament, she is often "Ashtoreth" and linked with Baal. Solomon worshiped Ashtoreth and built shrines for her, but Josiah later destroyed them ([2 Kings 23:13](https://ref.ly/2Kgs23:13); see [1 Kings 11:5](https://ref.ly/1Kgs11:5)). Ashtoreth was connected to the planet Venus and all types of reproduction in plants and animals, making her a popular idol for farmers and herdsmen. People believed offerings of incense, food, and liquids would magically trigger reproduction and prosperity.

The Judeans in Egypt were now free from their covenant obligations to the Lord. However, they also lost covenant protection. By choosing to end their relationship with the God of Israel, they gave up all privileges. They could not pray or make oaths in God's name. Still, the Lord would not be absent from their lives, as he would ensure that disaster affected them. Those who turned to the Lord in repentance would receive salvation and blessings. Even in Egypt, a small group of people, like Jeremiah and Baruch, trusted in the Lord.

This series of messages is aimed at foreign nations (see [Jeremiah 1:5](https://ref.ly/Jer1:5), [10](https://ref.ly/Jer1:10), and similar messages in [Isaiah 13–23](https://ref.ly/Isa13:1-Isa23:18); [Ezekiel 25–32](https://ref.ly/Ezek25:1-Ezek32:32); [Amos 1:3–2:3](https://ref.ly/Amos1:3-Amos2:3)). 

Through Nebuchadnezzar, the Lord planned to judge all nations from the Euphrates River to Egypt for their rebellion and sins against him (compare [Leviticus 18:24–25](https://ref.ly/Lev18:24-Lev18:25)). Eventually, Babylon would also face God's judgment ([Jeremiah 50–51](https://ref.ly/Jer50:1-Jer51:64)). These chapters were likely written while Jeremiah and Baruch were in hiding ([Jeremiah 36:27–32](https://ref.ly/Jer36:27-Jer36:32)). Among the warnings of doom for the foreign nations' sins are a few statements offering hope for salvation. Collections of oracles against the nations are also found in Isaiah ([Isaiah 13–23](https://ref.ly/Isa13:1-Isa23:18)) and Ezekiel ([Ezekiel 25–32](https://ref.ly/Ezek25:1-Ezek32:32)). Although God used nearby nations to punish his rebellious people, he also held those nations accountable for their actions. The Lord is not only the God of Israel; he is the God of the entire world.

Jeremiah used the outcome of a battle known to Jehoiakim to warn him and the people of Jerusalem. He said Egypt could not protect them from Babylon. Pharaoh Neco believed it was the right time to become the main power in the ancient Near East, so he moved north in 609 BC. Neco spent several years helping parts of the Assyrian army try to stop the Babylonian army's westward advance. However, he was defeated at Carchemish on the Euphrates River in 605 BC. Soon after, the Babylonian army surrounded Jerusalem and forced Jehoiakim to become a Babylonian vassal.

This chapter retells the story from [2 Kings 24:18–25:30](https://ref.ly/2Kgs24:18-2Kgs25:30), describing Jerusalem's last month, with some added details and changes. Repeating this passage highlights Jeremiah's honesty as a true prophet of God. Everything Jeremiah predicted about the city's destruction and the end of Judah's kingdom happened. Similarly, his predictions about the Exile, the hardships of the survivors in Babylon, and their return also came true.

The account in [2 Kings 24:12–14](https://ref.ly/2Kgs24:12-2Kgs24:14) says this event happened in Nebuchadnezzar’s eighth year. This difference shows two ancient Near Eastern ways of counting a king’s reign. In 2 Kings, the year Nebuchadnezzar became king is considered his first year. Jeremiah seems to count the first *full* year as Nebuchadnezzar’s first year.

The numbers in these verses add to the information in [2 Kings 24:14–16](https://ref.ly/2Kgs24:14-2Kgs24:16) about the exile in 597 BC. The deportation in [Jeremiah 52:30](https://ref.ly/Jer52:30) is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible. It was likely a Babylonian response to Gedaliah’s murder ([Jeremiah 41:1–3](https://ref.ly/Jer41:1-Jer41:3)). This suggests that the person or people who made this adaptation lived after 581 BC, probably in Babylon.
