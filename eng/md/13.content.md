## 1 Chronicles 1:1–4 (id: 13504)

A summary of the generations from Adam to the sons of Noah (compare [Genesis 5:3–32](https://ref.ly/Gen5:3-Gen5:32)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 1:1–1CH 1:4

## 1 Chronicles 1:1–2.2 (id: 13503)

The Chronicler starts by showing Israel's place among the nations. He traces their ancestry from Adam to Jacob, using information from Genesis.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 1:1–1CH 2:2

## 1 Chronicles 1:5–23 (id: 13509)

The record of Noah’s descendants shows Abraham’s place in history. The ethnic background of the seventy nations gives context to Israel’s history (compare [Genesis 10](https://ref.ly/Gen10:1-Gen10:32)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 1:5–1CH 1:23

## 1 Chronicles 1:13 (id: 13505)

*the father...of the Hittites*: Hebrew *ancestor of Heth.*

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 1:13

## 1 Chronicles 1:24–27 (id: 13506)

The summary of Shem’s descendants concludes with Abraham (see [Genesis 11:10–26](https://ref.ly/Gen11:10-Gen11:26)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 1:24–1CH 1:27

## 1 Chronicles 1:28–33 (id: 13507)

The Chronicler, like the author of Genesis, lists Abraham's descendants separately from Isaac. He mentions Ishmael's sons ([1 Chronicles 1:29–31](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:29-1Chr1:31); compare [Genesis 25:12–15](https://ref.ly/Gen25:12-Gen25:15)) and Keturah's sons ([1 Chronicles 1:32–33](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:32-1Chr1:33); compare [Genesis 25:1–3](https://ref.ly/Gen25:1-Gen25:3)) before focusing on the chosen family line.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 1:28–1CH 1:33

## 1 Chronicles 1:34–2.2 (id: 13508)

Isaac’s genealogy first lists Esau's descendants ([1 Chronicles 1:35–54](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:35-1Chr1:54)) and then continues with Israel. The history of Edom is divided into three parts: 

* Esau's sons ([1 Chronicles 1:35–37](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:35-1Chr1:37))
* Seir's descendants ([1 Chronicles 1:38–42](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:38-1Chr1:42))
* The kings who ruled Edom ([1 Chronicles 1:43–54](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:43-1Chr1:54))

This arrangement follows [Genesis 36](https://ref.ly/Gen36:1-Gen36:43).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 1:34–1CH 2:2

## 1 Chronicles 1:51–54 (id: 13510)

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 1:51–1CH 1:54

## 1 Chronicles 2:3 (id: 13560)

Er and Onan, the first two sons of Judah, faced destruction because of their sins ([Genesis 38:6–10](https://ref.ly/Gen38:6-Gen38:10)). The descendants of Shelah appear as an addition at the end of Judah's genealogies ([1 Chronicles 4:21–23](https://ref.ly/1Chr4:21-1Chr4:23)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 2:3

## 1 Chronicles 2:3–8 (id: 13559)

The genealogy of Judah is detailed, including background information on David's ancestors. Compare [Genesis 46:12](https://ref.ly/Gen46:12).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 2:3–1CH 2:8

## 1 Chronicles 2:3–4.23 (id: 13558)

The genealogies show all the people of Israel ([1 Chronicles 2:1–2](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:1-1Chr2:2)), but they focus more on David's ancestors from the tribe of Judah.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 2:3–1CH 2:15

## 1 Chronicles 2:4–5 (id: 13561)

* The main ancestral line of David comes from Perez, one of Tamar's sons. Tamar was Judah's widowed daughter\-in\-law.
* Hamul, one of Perez's sons, is not mentioned at all. The Chronicler might not have had information about him.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 2:4–1CH 2:5

## 1 Chronicles 2:6–8 (id: 13562)

For the family history of Zerah, compare [Joshua 7:1](https://ref.ly/Josh7:1), [17](https://ref.ly/Josh7:17); [1 Kings 4:31](https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:31) (Mahol might be another name for Zerah).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 2:6–1CH 2:8

## 1 Chronicles 2:7 (id: 13563)

*devoted things*: See “Complete Destruction” Theme Note.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 2:7
* **Associated Articles:** Complete Destruction (ID: `500210@TyndaleStudyNotesThemes`)

## 1 Chronicles 2:9 (id: 13565)

Caleb was the most notable direct descendant of Hezron, so the author describes his descendants in detail ([1 Chronicles 2:42–55](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:42-1Chr2:55)). This Caleb was apparently different from Caleb, son of Jephunneh, who was a descendant of Kenaz (see study note on 1 Chronicles 4:13–15).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 2:9
* **Associated Articles:** 1 Chronicles 4:13-15 (ID: `13628@TyndaleStudyNotes`)

## 1 Chronicles 2:9–55 (id: 13564)

The descendants of Hezron are listed up to the time of David in several sections: 

* The direct line from Hezron to David ([1 Chronicles 2:9–17](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:9-1Chr2:17); compare [Ruth 4:18–22](https://ref.ly/Ruth4:18-Ruth4:22))
* The other descendants of Hezron ([1 Chronicles 2:18–41](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:18-1Chr2:41))
* The descendants of Hezron’s son Caleb ([1 Chronicles 2:42–55](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:42-1Chr2:55))

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 2:9–1CH 2:55

## 1 Chronicles 2:10–17 (id: 13553)

The passage about Ram's descendants shows a direct line from Ram to Jesse and then lists Jesse's children.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 2:10–1CH 2:17

## 1 Chronicles 2:14–15 (id: 13554)

The Chronicler lists David as the seventh son of Jesse, while Samuel lists him as the eighth ([1 Samuel 16:6–13](https://ref.ly/1Sam16:6-1Sam16:13); [17:12](https://ref.ly/1Sam17:12)). Samuel does not mention the names of David’s fourth, fifth, or sixth brothers: 

* Nethanel
* Raddai
* Ozem

Later, the Chronicler mentions a brother named Elihu, who might have been an additional son (see study note on 1 Chronicles 27:18). The number seven, considered the “perfect” number, might symbolize that God chose David to rule.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 2:14–1CH 2:15
* **Associated Articles:** 1 Chronicles 27:18 (ID: `13599@TyndaleStudyNotes`)

## 1 Chronicles 2:20 (id: 13555)

The Lord selected Bezalel, a craftsman from Hezron's family, to build the Tabernacle (see [Exodus 31:1–2](https://ref.ly/Exod31:1-Exod31:2)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 2:20

## 1 Chronicles 2:21–23 (id: 13556)

Some families from Gilead, who are listed as part of the tribe of Manasseh (see [Numbers 32:39–42](https://ref.ly/Num32:39-Num32:42)), also had ties to the tribe of Judah.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 2:21–1CH 2:23

## 1 Chronicles 2:24 (id: 13557)

Tekoa was a small village in Judea, located southeast of Bethlehem (see also [1 Chronicles 4:5–8](https://ref.ly/1Chr4:5-1Chr4:8)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 2:24

## 1 Chronicles 3:1–9 (id: 13621)

The list of David's sons comes from information in the book of Samuel ([2 Samuel 3:2–5](https://ref.ly/2Sam3:2-2Sam3:5); [5:14–16](https://ref.ly/2Sam5:14-2Sam5:16)). The list separates the sons born while David ruled in Hebron from those born in Jerusalem.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 3:1–1CH 3:9

## 1 Chronicles 3:1–24 (id: 13620)

The genealogy of David continues from the genealogy of Ram ([1 Chronicles 2:10–17](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:10-1Chr2:17)), listing David as the seventh son of Jesse ([2:15](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:15)). David’s genealogy has three parts: 

1. David’s sons ([1 Chronicles 3:1–9](https://ref.ly/1Chr3:1-1Chr3:9))
2. The kings of Judah up to Jehoiachin and Zedekiah ([1 Chronicles 3:10–16](https://ref.ly/1Chr3:10-1Chr3:16)), who were exiled to Babylon
3. The descendants of Jehoiachin up to the Chronicler's time ([1 Chronicles 3:17–24](https://ref.ly/1Chr3:17-1Chr3:24))

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 3:1–1CH 3:24

## 1 Chronicles 3:10–16 (id: 13622)

The Chronicler lists the kings of Judah in order, from father to son, starting with Solomon and ending with the exile in Babylon.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 3:10–1CH 3:16

## 1 Chronicles 3:15 (id: 13623)

Three of Josiah's four sons became kings of Judah.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 3:15

## 1 Chronicles 3:16 (id: 13624)

*The successors of Jehoiakim: Jeconiah his son, and Zedekiah*: At the end of Judah's monarchy, the eldest son did not always become king.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 3:16

## 1 Chronicles 3:17–23 (id: 13625)

This part of David's family tree goes up to about 400 BC.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 3:17–1CH 3:23

## 1 Chronicles 3:21 (id: 13626)

*The descendants of Hananiah...Shecaniah*: In Hebrew, all names are listed as "the sons" of Hananiah, suggesting one generation. However, many ancient manuscripts and translations suggest the list spans several generations. They translate "sons of" (Hebrew *beney*) as "son of" (Hebrew *beno*). This genealogy then covers several generations from the time of Zerubbabel and his son Hananiah.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 3:21

## 1 Chronicles 4:1–7 (id: 13627)

The genealogy of Judah continues, linking back to [1 Chronicles 2:1–55](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:1-1Chr2:55). It immediately connects to Hur, the ancestor of Bethlehem ([1 Chronicles 4:1–4](https://ref.ly/1Chr4:1-1Chr4:4); see [2:19–20](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:19-1Chr2:20), [51–55](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:51-1Chr2:55)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 4:1–1CH 4:7

## 1 Chronicles 4:9–10 (id: 13636)

The section about Jabez stands alone, allowing the Chronicler to explain his name's origin. Jabez is not mentioned earlier, although it is also the name of a town where some of Hur's son Salma's descendants lived ([1 Chronicles 2:55](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:55)). Jabez likely got his name because he caused his mother pain, fulfilling Eve's curse ([Genesis 3:16](https://ref.ly/Gen3:16)). Despite his name being a curse, he was more honorable than his brothers, and his prayer changed his life's outcome. The prayer is poetic and includes a plea for blessing, along with requests for prosperity and protection from harm. His last request might mean "keep me from causing trouble and pain." God listened to his prayer and removed his curse.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 4:9–1CH 4:10

## 1 Chronicles 4:9–20 (id: 13637)

The exact family trees of Judah's remaining descendants are unknown. The Chronicler likely had incomplete information.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 4:9–1CH 4:20

## 1 Chronicles 4:13–15 (id: 13628)

The name Kenaz also appears as a descendant of Esau through Eliphaz ([Genesis 36:11](https://ref.ly/Gen36:11)). Kenaz's descendants are known as the Kenizzites. The Kenizzites lived in the southern part of the land and had ties with Judah and Edom. Caleb, son of Jephunneh, was a Kenizzite ([Numbers 32:12](https://ref.ly/Num32:12); [Joshua 14:6](https://ref.ly/Josh14:6)) and had a brother named Kenaz ([Joshua 15:17](https://ref.ly/Josh15:17)), whose family is listed here.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 4:13–1CH 4:15

## 1 Chronicles 4:18 (id: 13629)

Mered's wife, Bithia, was a daughter of Pharaoh. This made some of Judah's descendants part Egyptian.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 4:18

## 1 Chronicles 4:21–23 (id: 13630)

After recording Judah’s descendants through his wife Tamar ([1 Chronicles 2:4–4:20](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:4-1Chr4:20)), the text lists the descendants of Shelah, Judah’s third son with Bathshua (see [1 Chronicles 2:3](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:3); [Genesis 38:2](https://ref.ly/Gen38:2),[5](https://ref.ly/Gen38:5)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 4:21–1CH 4:23

## 1 Chronicles 4:24–43 (id: 13631)

Simeon was Jacob’s second son. His tribe's land was in southern Judah ([Joshua 19:1–9](https://ref.ly/Josh19:1-Josh19:9)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 4:24–1CH 4:43

## 1 Chronicles 4:24–8.40 (id: 13632)

After finishing the genealogy of Judah’s descendants ([1 Chronicles 2:3–4:23](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:3-1Chr4:23)), the Chronicler examines the records for the other sons of Israel (compare [2:1–2](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:1-1Chr2:2)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 4:24

## 1 Chronicles 4:34–43 (id: 13633)

The list of men described as leaders of Simeon's wealthy clans ([1 Chronicles 4:34–38](https://ref.ly/1Chr4:34-1Chr4:38)) leads into the description of Simeon's geographic expansion ([4:38–43](https://ref.ly/1Chr4:38-1Chr4:43)). The tribe expanded with thirteen family leaders during Hezekiah's time (late 700s BC) in the Gerar area. This might have been part of Hezekiah's military action against Philistine territories ([2 Kings 18:8](https://ref.ly/2Kgs18:8)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 4:34–1CH 4:43

## 1 Chronicles 4:39 (id: 13634)

*Gedor*: The exact location is unclear because *Gedor* (in Hebrew) is a common name. The Greek version, *Gerar*, likely refers to a city in Philistia, west of Judah ([Genesis 10:19](https://ref.ly/Gen10:19)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 4:39

## 1 Chronicles 4:41 (id: 13635)

## 1 Chronicles 5:1–2 (id: 13639)

Reuben was Israel's oldest son, but he lost his birthright because he had sexual relations with his father's concubine ([Genesis 35:22](https://ref.ly/Gen35:22)). Jacob gave this right to Joseph by making Ephraim and Manasseh full members of the tribes ([Genesis 48:5](https://ref.ly/Gen48:5)). This act gave Joseph the double portion usually meant for the firstborn ([Deuteronomy 21:15–17](https://ref.ly/Deut21:15-Deut21:17)). As Jacob predicted, Judah became more prominent than his brothers and was the ancestor of the ruling tribe ([Genesis 49:8–10](https://ref.ly/Gen49:8-Gen49:10)). However, Reuben is still listed first ([1 Chronicles 2:1](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:1)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 5:1–1CH 5:2

## 1 Chronicles 5:1–24 (id: 13638)

Chapter 5 lists the family histories for: 

* Reuben ([1 Chronicles 5:1–10](https://ref.ly/1Chr5:1-1Chr5:10); compare [Genesis 46:9](https://ref.ly/Gen46:9))
* Gad ([1 Chronicles 5:11–17](https://ref.ly/1Chr5:11-1Chr5:17))
* Manasseh ([1 Chronicles 5:23–24](https://ref.ly/1Chr5:23-1Chr5:24))

These are the tribes of Israel that settled in Transjordan (the area east of the Jordan River).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 5:1–1CH 5:24

## 1 Chronicles 5:3 (id: 13643)

The sons of Reuben are also mentioned in[Genesis 46:9](https://ref.ly/Gen46:9); [Exodus 6:14](https://ref.ly/Exod6:14); [Numbers 26:5–6](https://ref.ly/Num26:5-Num26:6).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 5:3

## 1 Chronicles 5:4–8 (id: 13644)

We do not know how Joel's descendants are related to the rest of the Reuben tribe.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 5:4–1CH 5:8

## 1 Chronicles 5:6 (id: 13645)

Tiglath\-pileser was the king of Assyria from 744 to 727 BC. He attacked the tribes of Transjordan during King Pekah’s reign, which lasted from 752 to 732 BC. He took the people into captivity (see [1 Chronicles 5:25–26](https://ref.ly/1Chr5:25-1Chr5:26); [2 Kings 15:29](https://ref.ly/2Kgs15:29)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 5:6

## 1 Chronicles 5:10 (id: 13640)

The tribes of Transjordan, including the Reubenites, expanded their settlements north and east during their war with the Hagrites in Saul's time (see [1 Chronicles 5:18–22](https://ref.ly/1Chr5:18-1Chr5:22); [Psalm 83:6](https://ref.ly/Ps83:6)). Later, some Hagrites joined David's men (see [1 Chronicles 11:38](https://ref.ly/1Chr11:38); [27:31](https://ref.ly/1Chr27:31)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 5:10

## 1 Chronicles 5:18–22 (id: 13641)

The story of the war against the Hagrites expands on the elements introduced in [1 Chronicles 5:10](https://ref.ly/1Chr5:10). It was a conflict among shepherds over grazing land. All three tribes took part. The Chronicler describes their skills, military abilities, and numbers. With God fighting against the enemy, they won a great victory, gaining huge spoils and complete control of the territory.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 5:18–1CH 5:22

## 1 Chronicles 5:25–26 (id: 13642)

The tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half\-tribe of Manasseh went into permanent exile due to their unfaithfulness.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 5:25–1CH 5:26

## 1 Chronicles 6:1 (id: 13650)

The three sons of Levi are mentioned, but their family trees are given after the list of high priests.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 6:1

## 1 Chronicles 6:1–48 (id: 13646)

This section gives the family histories of the three main groups of the tribe of Levi: 

1. The high priests ([1 Chronicles 6:1–15](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:1-1Chr6:15))
2. The three clans of Levites ([1 Chronicles 6:16–30](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:16-1Chr6:30))
3. The singers ([1 Chronicles 6:31–47](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:31-1Chr6:47))

Each family history starts with an introduction and then lists the names.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 6:1–1CH 6:48

## 1 Chronicles 6:1–81 (id: 13647)

This section highlights the importance of the priestly tribe of Levi due to its central position in the genealogical lists.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 6:1–1CH 6:81

## 1 Chronicles 6:2–15 (id: 13651)

After the exile in Babylon, the Judean community needed to confirm the legitimate ancestry of the priests. This genealogy of Kohath linked the ancestors from the Pentateuch to the high priests up to Judah's exile in 586 BC. Other records connected the priests after the exile to this lineage (see [Ezra 3:2](https://ref.ly/Ezra3:2); [7:1–6](https://ref.ly/Ezra7:1-Ezra7:6); [Haggai 1:1](https://ref.ly/Hag1:1)). Not all high priests were included in this list.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 6:2–1CH 6:15

## 1 Chronicles 6:10 (id: 13648)

Most Old Testament scholars agree that the phrase about the high priest at the Temple built by Solomon in Jerusalem should be in [1 Chronicles 6:9](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:9) (related to the first Azariah). They believe a scribal error changed the order. Correcting this shows 12 generations between Aaron and the Temple's construction, matching the date in [1 Kings 6:1](https://ref.ly/1Kgs6:1) (480 years equals 12 generations of 40 years each in numerical typology). The correction also shows 12 generations between the Temple's construction under Azariah and its rebuilding under Jeshua ([Ezra 3:2](https://ref.ly/Ezra3:2)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 6:10

## 1 Chronicles 6:16–30 (id: 13649)

The second introduction of the Levites ([1 Chronicles 6:16–19a](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:16-1Chr6:19)) presents the leaders of all the Levitical families ([6:19b–30](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:19-1Chr6:30)). The list includes the family trees of: 

* Gershon ([1 Chronicles 6:20–21](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:20-1Chr6:21))
* Kohath ([1 Chronicles 6:22–24](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:22-1Chr6:24))
* Merari ([1 Chronicles 6:29–30](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:29-1Chr6:30))

This explanation of the priests' rights introduces the following list.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 6:49

## 1 Chronicles 6:50–53 (id: 13657)

The list of priests from Aaron to Ahimaaz introduces the territorial list ([1 Chronicles 6:54–81](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:54-1Chr6:81)). The list continues to the time of David, when Ahimaaz served ([2 Samuel 15:36](https://ref.ly/2Sam15:36); [17:17–29](https://ref.ly/2Sam17:17-2Sam17:29); [18:19–29](https://ref.ly/2Sam18:19-2Sam18:29)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 6:50–1CH 6:53

## 1 Chronicles 6:54–81 (id: 13658)

The list of Levitical cities comes from [Joshua 21](https://ref.ly/Josh21:1-Josh21:45). It follows a geographical order, with families grouped by specific areas. This list shows Israel's unity and completeness. It presents the Levites as settled in the land just like the other tribes.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 6:54–1CH 6:81

## 1 Chronicles 7:1–40 (id: 13659)

* This chapter provides the genealogies of the remaining tribes of Israel.
* The sections on the tribes of Issachar, Benjamin, and Asher may come from a military census. These lists are almost the same length, use military terms, record the father's houses, and do not mention settlements.

## 1 Chronicles 7:12 (id: 13660)

The Hebrew text of this verse seems disrupted, likely due to a loss during scribal copying, as there is no introduction for Ir or Hushim. The names Shuppim and Huppim appear in the tribe of Benjamin ([1 Chronicles 8:8](https://ref.ly/1Chr8:8), [11](https://ref.ly/1Chr8:11); [Genesis 46:21](https://ref.ly/Gen46:21); [Numbers 26:39](https://ref.ly/Num26:39)). If the Hebrew text is indeed damaged, Hushim might be a descendant of Dan (compare [Genesis 46:23](https://ref.ly/Gen46:23); [Numbers 26:42](https://ref.ly/Num26:42)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 7:12

## 1 Chronicles 7:13 (id: 13661)

Unlike other genealogies, this list of Naphtali's sons shows only the first generation (see [Genesis 46:24](https://ref.ly/Gen46:24); [Numbers 26:48–50](https://ref.ly/Num26:48-Num26:50)). The Chronicles manuscript might have been damaged early in its copying, which could explain why Dan and Zebulun are missing. It is also possible that records for Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali were lost when Tiglath\-pileser attacked and exiled these tribes during Pekah’s reign ([2 Kings 15:29](https://ref.ly/2Kgs15:29)). In that case, the Chronicler had no records to include.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 7:13

## 1 Chronicles 7:14–19 (id: 13662)

These verses have several issues that suggest the Hebrew text might be damaged: 

1. Maacah is listed as both the sister and wife of Makir ([1 Chronicles 7:15–16](https://ref.ly/1Chr7:15-1Chr7:16)).
2. Huppim and Shuppim were earlier listed with Benjamin ([1 Chronicles 7:12](https://ref.ly/1Chr7:12)), not Manasseh.
3. Those considered Gileadites ([1 Chronicles 7:16–17](https://ref.ly/1Chr7:16-1Chr7:17)) are vaguely linked to Gilead, whose direct descendants are not listed (compare [Numbers 26:30–33](https://ref.ly/Num26:30-Num26:33)).
4. The sons of Shemida are not connected to the genealogy ([1 Chronicles 7:19](https://ref.ly/1Chr7:19)) Shemida was one of Gilead’s descendants ([Numbers 26:32](https://ref.ly/Num26:32)).

## 1 Chronicles 7:20–27 (id: 13663)

The genealogy of Ephraim's descendants includes a story about how the tribe settled in Canaan ([1 Chronicles 7:21–24](https://ref.ly/1Chr7:21-1Chr7:24)). The genealogy concludes with Joshua, son of Nun, who led Israel into the promised land.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 7:20–1CH 7:27

## 1 Chronicles 7:22 (id: 13664)

Ephraim is recorded as the father of Ezer and Elead. However, Ephraim, the son of Joseph, could not have settled in Canaan after the Exodus. Traditionally, people imagined an early exodus for Ephraim's family. Other possibilities include that the name *Ephraim* is a scribal error or that *Ephraim* referred to the tribe, not Joseph's son.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 7:22

## 1 Chronicles 8:1–40 (id: 13665)

The genealogy of Benjamin's descendants concludes the genealogies. The record starts with Judah, David's tribe, and ends with Benjamin, Saul's tribe.

## 1 Chronicles 8:3 (id: 13668)

*Gera, Abihud*: According to the translation, Bela had two sons named *Gera* ([1 Chronicles 8:3](https://ref.ly/1Chr8:3), [5](https://ref.ly/1Chr8:5)), which is unusual. If the suggestion in the New Living Translation note is correct, the second Gera was the son of the first Gera.

## 1 Chronicles 8:33–40 (id: 13667)

The Chronicler ends his account of Benjamin's history with Saul's family tree. It starts two generations before Saul and goes through Merib\-baal (also known as Mephibosheth; see study note on 2 Samuel 4:4) and continues to the families of Azel and Eshek ([1 Chronicles 8:38–40](https://ref.ly/1Chr8:38-1Chr8:40)). Micah ([1 Chronicles 8:35](https://ref.ly/1Chr8:35)) lived during Solomon's time, and Ulam ([8:39](https://ref.ly/1Chr8:39)) lived near the end of Judah's kingdom before Jerusalem's destruction. This connects Saul to his broader tribal history and a noble heritage that lasted throughout the kingdom period.

* The Book of the Kings of Israel was a source document used by the authors of both Kings and Chronicles, but it is now lost (see also study note on 1 Kings 14:19–20).

## 1 Chronicles 9:1–34 (id: 13671)

The Chronicler explains how people and institutions returning from the exile in Babylon connected with the past. The Levites and priests are important in this summary of Israel. The Chronicler believes they were central to the nation's organization. They were vital to Israel's success as a nation with God as king. The Chronicler used ancient records from Moses and David ([1 Chronicles 9:19–22](https://ref.ly/1Chr9:19-1Chr9:22)) to describe each group's homeland and rank.

Saul's family's role in the kingdom is already set ([1 Chronicles 8:29–40](https://ref.ly/1Chr8:29-1Chr8:40)). Repeating this information helps move from the genealogies to the stories, starting with Saul's death ([1 Chronicles 10](https://ref.ly/1Chr10:1-1Chr10:14)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 9:35–1CH 9:44

## 1 Chronicles 10:1–14 (id: 13511)

The story of Israel as a kingdom starts with Saul's death. Saul did not achieve God's plans for him as king or for Israel as a nation. His death made way for David, whom the Chronicler saw as Israel's first true king.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 10:1–1CH 10:14

## 1 Chronicles 10:6–12 (id: 13512)

*Saul died together with his three sons and all his house*: The Chronicler does not mention Saul’s armor bearer or the rest of his troops (see [1 Samuel 31:6](https://ref.ly/1Sam31:6)). This emphasizes God's role in removing Saul and replacing him with David ([1 Chronicles 10:14](https://ref.ly/1Chr10:14)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 10:6–1CH 10:12

## 1 Chronicles 11:1–3 (id: 13513)

David first became king of Judah in Hebron and ruled there for seven and a half years ([1 Chronicles 3:4](https://ref.ly/1Chr3:4); [2 Samuel 5:5](https://ref.ly/2Sam5:5)). The Chronicler does not include the details of that time (see [2 Samuel 2–4](https://ref.ly/2Sam2:1-2Sam4:12)) and instead focuses on David’s 33 and a half years ruling the entire nation. This began with his agreement with all the elders of Israel at Hebron (see [2 Samuel 5:1–5](https://ref.ly/2Sam5:1-2Sam5:5)).

## 1 Chronicles 12:1–22 (id: 13518)

Support for making David king started before Saul's death. When Saul was king and David was on the run, warriors joined David, forming a large group from various tribes across Israel. Even Saul's relatives left him to support David as king ([1 Chronicles 12:2](https://ref.ly/1Chr12:2)). David wisely assessed these deserters ([1 Chronicles 12:17](https://ref.ly/1Chr12:17)) to ensure they were not spies for Saul. Before David was officially anointed at Hebron, the people's wishes aligned with God's will for David to become king.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 12:1–1CH 12:22

## 1 Chronicles 12:23–40 (id: 13519)

The succession of a king was often a contentious issue, especially when the new king came from a different family. The gathering of all twelve tribes at Hebron, including some of Saul’s relatives ([1 Chronicles 12:29](https://ref.ly/1Chr12:29)), to confirm David’s rule showed that the tribes had resolved their conflicts after Saul’s death ([12:23–37](https://ref.ly/1Chr12:23-1Chr12:37)). The Chronicler emphasizes the unity among the tribes by stating that they all had the single purpose of making David the king over all Israel ([1 Chronicles 12:38](https://ref.ly/1Chr12:38)).

## 1 Chronicles 13:1–17.27 (id: 13520)

These chapters describe how Jerusalem became the political and religious center of Israel. The story begins with David's failed attempt to move the Ark of God from Kiriath\-jearim to Jerusalem ([1 Chronicles 13:1–14](https://ref.ly/1Chr13:1-1Chr13:14); compare[2 Samuel 6:2–11](https://ref.ly/2Sam6:2-2Sam6:11)).

## 1 Chronicles 14:1–7 (id: 13524)

Although the ark was not in Jerusalem ([1 Chronicles 13:1–14](https://ref.ly/1Chr13:1-1Chr13:14)), God blessed David's palace, his children, and his victory over the Philistines. God's blessing did not rely on the ark's presence. These blessings eventually motivated David to follow through with his original plan to bring the ark into Jerusalem ([1 Chronicles 15:1–29](https://ref.ly/1Chr15:1-1Chr15:29)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 14:1–1CH 14:7

## 1 Chronicles 14:8–17 (id: 13526)

When David became ruler of all Israel, the Philistines attacked. They no longer saw him as under their control, as they did when he only ruled Judah. They attacked through the valley southwest of Jerusalem (see [Joshua 15:8](https://ref.ly/Josh15:8)). Before the battle, David asked the Lord for guidance, unlike Saul, who asked a medium for help against the Philistines ([1 Chronicles 10:13](https://ref.ly/1Chr10:13); see [1 Samuel 28](https://ref.ly/1Sam28:1-1Sam28:25)).

The first attempt to bring the ark to Jerusalem ([1 Chronicles 13:1–14](https://ref.ly/1Chr13:1-1Chr13:14)) failed due to improper procedure (see [15:13](https://ref.ly/1Chr15:13)). This time, David prepared a place for the ark in Jerusalem and organized the Levites to carry it, as this was their responsibility ([Deuteronomy 10:8](https://ref.ly/Deut10:8); [18:5](https://ref.ly/Deut18:5)). The special tent David prepared for the ark was not the tabernacle, which was located at Gibeon at that time (see [1 Chronicles 16:39](https://ref.ly/1Chr16:39); [21:29](https://ref.ly/1Chr21:29)).

## 1 Chronicles 15:29 (id: 13534)

Michal's contempt for David (compare [2 Samuel 6:16–23](https://ref.ly/2Sam6:16-2Sam6:23)) contrasts with God's blessing on the celebration ([1 Chronicles 15:26](https://ref.ly/1Chr15:26)). Her description as Saul's daughter suggests her attitude reflected her father's disregard for the Lord (see [1 Samuel 10:10–12](https://ref.ly/1Sam10:10-1Sam10:12); [13:7–14](https://ref.ly/1Sam13:7-1Sam13:14); [15:10–23](https://ref.ly/1Sam15:10-1Sam15:23); [28:1–25](https://ref.ly/1Sam28:1-1Sam28:25)).

The transfer of the ark ([1 Chronicles 16:1–3](https://ref.ly/1Chr16:1-1Chr16:3)) and the event's conclusion ([16:43](https://ref.ly/1Chr16:43)) are reported just like in Samuel (see [2 Samuel 6:17–20](https://ref.ly/2Sam6:17-2Sam6:20)). However, between these parts, the Chronicler adds details about the celebrations and the permanent worship arrangements ([1 Chronicles 16:4–42](https://ref.ly/1Chr16:4-1Chr16:42)). David’s psalm of celebration is the main focus of the account.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 16:1–1CH 16:43

## 1 Chronicles 16:7–36 (id: 13537)

David’s song of thanksgiving combines three psalms: 

* [First Chronicles 16:8–22](https://ref.ly/1Chr16:8-1Chr16:22) uses [Psalm 105:1–15](https://ref.ly/Ps105:1-Ps105:15)
* [First Chronicles 16:23–33](https://ref.ly/1Chr16:23-1Chr16:33) uses [Psalm 96](https://ref.ly/Ps96:1-Ps96:13)
* [First Chronicles 16:34–38](https://ref.ly/1Chr16:34-1Chr16:38) uses [Psalm 106:1](https://ref.ly/Ps106:1), [47–48](https://ref.ly/Ps106:47-Ps106:48)

The composer adjusted the sources for this occasion. The Temple did not exist when the ark was brought to Jerusalem, so the Chronicler says strength and joy fill his dwelling ([1 Chronicles 16:27](https://ref.ly/1Chr16:27)) instead of *His sanctuary* ([Psalm 96:6](https://ref.ly/Ps96:6)) and asks the worshiper to come into his presence ([1 Chronicles 16:29](https://ref.ly/1Chr16:29)) instead of *enter* *His courts* ([Psalm 96:8](https://ref.ly/Ps96:8)). The name *Abraham* ([Psalm 105:9](https://ref.ly/Ps105:9)) changes to *Israel* ([1 Chronicles 16:13](https://ref.ly/1Chr16:13)) to focus on the nation as the fulfillment of Abraham's promises. The hymn does not mention the judgment of the earth ([Psalm 96:10](https://ref.ly/Ps96:10), [13](https://ref.ly/Ps96:13); compare [1 Chronicles 16:30](https://ref.ly/1Chr16:30), [33](https://ref.ly/1Chr16:33)) because it was not relevant to the ark's dedication.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 16:7–1CH 16:36

Gibeon was the main place of worship until they built the temple in Jerusalem (see [1 Chronicles 21:29](https://ref.ly/1Chr21:29); [2 Chronicles 1:3](https://ref.ly/2Chr1:3)). They had to reorganize the tabernacle staff because some Levites moved permanently to Jerusalem.

David wanted to build a home for the ark as grand as his palace*,* but the Lord chose David’s heir, Solomon ([1 Chronicles 22](https://ref.ly/1Chr22:1-1Chr22:19)), to build the temple. Jerusalem was to be the only place of worship for all Israel.

In [2 Samuel 7:16](https://ref.ly/2Sam7:16), God promises to establish David’s house, kingdom, and throne. Here, the promise is for Solomon. The books of Samuel and Kings portray David as Israel’s ideal king, but the Chronicler sees Solomon as David’s equal. David prepared for building the temple, but God chose Solomon to build it. The promise to Israel was fulfilled during the reigns of both David and Solomon.

## 1 Chronicles 18:1–20.8 (id: 13545)

* This section tells about David's wars and military successes, showing him as a great warrior in Israel's history. It focuses on the public and political sides of David's enemies, with little about their private lives.
* There are three main parts that match accounts in Samuel:

    1. Battles during the kingdom's expansion ([1 Chronicles 18:1–17](https://ref.ly/1Chr18:1-1Chr18:17); see [2 Samuel 8:1–16](https://ref.ly/2Sam8:1-2Sam8:16))
        2. The battle against the Ammonites ([1 Chronicles 19:1–20:3](https://ref.ly/1Chr19:1-1Chr20:3); see [2 Samuel 10:1–11:1](https://ref.ly/2Sam10:1-2Sam10:11); [12:30–31](https://ref.ly/2Sam12:30-2Sam12:31))
        3. The deeds of David's mighty men ([1 Chronicles 20:4–8](https://ref.ly/1Chr20:4-1Chr20:8); see [2 Samuel 21:18–22](https://ref.ly/2Sam21:18-2Sam21:22))
        Each part starts with a time transition (*some time later*) that loosely connects these events ([1 Chronicles 18:1](https://ref.ly/1Chr18:1); [19:1](https://ref.ly/1Chr19:1); [20:4](https://ref.ly/1Chr20:4)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 18:1–1CH 20:8

## 1 Chronicles 18:2–13 (id: 13548)

David conquered areas east of the Jordan River in stages. First, he took over Moab in the south, securing control of the plateau north of the Arnon River. His victory over the Aramean alliance led by Hadadezer resulted in an alliance with King Toi of Hamath, who was Hadadezer's enemy ([1 Chronicles 18:9–11](https://ref.ly/1Chr18:9-1Chr18:11)). After defeating Ammon and the Arameans east of the Jordan, David expanded his control over southern Edom and gained access to a southern seaport ([1 Chronicles 18:12–13](https://ref.ly/1Chr18:12-1Chr18:13)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 18:2–1CH 18:13

## 1 Chronicles 18:14–17 (id: 13546)

The list of David's officials shows the strength of his rule over all of Israel.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 18:14–1CH 18:17

## 1 Chronicles 19:1–7 (id: 13549)

The new Ammonite ruler, Hanun, opposed Israel being near his nation. The Ammonites hired Aramean armies from the north. These combined forces gathered at Medeba to challenge David's control of Moab's plateau.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 19:1–1CH 19:7

## 1 Chronicles 19:9–13 (id: 13552)

The enemy armies set up their battle lines carefully. The Ammonites positioned themselves so that the city of Medeba could be a safe place. Meanwhile, the Israelites faced a second attack from the Arameans. Joab split his forces to fight on both sides from a central gathering point.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 19:9–1CH 19:13

## 1 Chronicles 19:13 (id: 13550)

* Joab understood that the battle aimed to protect the people and cities of Israel from invasion, not to gain more land (see [1 Chronicles 19:8](https://ref.ly/1Chr19:8)).
* Joab trusted God, believing the outcome relied on the Lord's guidance.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 19:13

## 1 Chronicles 19:16–19 (id: 13551)

In the battle against the Arameans*,* David achieved three goals: 

1. He challenged Hadadezer's power
2. He disrupted the Aramean alliance
3. He stopped any future alliance between the Arameans and the Ammonites

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 19:16–1CH 19:19

## 1 Chronicles 20:1–3 (id: 13566)

This war against the Ammonites happened during David's sin with Bathsheba ([2 Samuel 11:2–12:25](https://ref.ly/2Sam11:2-2Sam12:25)), which the Chronicler does not mention.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 20:1–1CH 20:3

## 1 Chronicles 21:1 (id: 13569)

Satan, (also called *the adversary*), encouraged David to count his military forces (see [2 Samuel 24:1](https://ref.ly/2Sam24:1)). The Chronicler views the story in Samuel through his understanding of Satan as an opponent of God and humanity. God allows Satan to act in the world, and through this, Satan unknowingly serves God's purposes (see [2 Chronicles 18:3–34](https://ref.ly/2Chr18:3-2Chr18:34); [Job 1:6–2:7](https://ref.ly/Job1:6-Job2:7); [Zechariah 3:1–2](https://ref.ly/Zech3:1-Zech3:2); [Matthew 4:1–11](https://ref.ly/Matt4:1-Matt4:11); [John 13:27](https://ref.ly/John13:27); [1 Corinthians 5:5](https://ref.ly/1Cor5:5); [2 Corinthians 12:7](https://ref.ly/2Cor12:7); [1 Timothy 1:20](https://ref.ly/1Tim1:20); [Revelation 20:3](https://ref.ly/Rev20:3), [7–9](https://ref.ly/Rev20:7-Rev20:9)).

## 1 Chronicles 21:1–22.1 (id: 13567)

This account of the census is similar to [2 Samuel 24:1–25](https://ref.ly/2Sam24:1-2Sam24:25) but focuses on different aspects. The Chronicler’s version sets the stage for dedicating the altar and preparing to build the temple ([1 Chronicles 22](https://ref.ly/1Chr22:1-1Chr22:19)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 21:1–1CH 22:1

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 21:9

## 1 Chronicles 21:16–17 (id: 13568)

These verses describe the angel and David's response in more detail than the similar text in [2 Samuel 24:17](https://ref.ly/2Sam24:17). Seeing the angel on his mission moved David to plead for the people.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 21:16–1CH 21:17

## 1 Chronicles 21:26–22.1 (id: 13570)

The census and plague led to dedicating Araunah’s threshing floor as the site for the new sanctuary. Normally, offerings were made at Gibeon, where the tabernacle was located (see [1 Chronicles 16:39](https://ref.ly/1Chr16:39); [21:29](https://ref.ly/1Chr21:29); [2 Chronicles 1:3](https://ref.ly/2Chr1:3)). The plague stopped at the *threshing floor*, allowing David to make offerings there as instructed by Gad the seer ([1 Chronicles 21:18](https://ref.ly/1Chr21:18)). David then chose this new location for the future temple of the Lord God.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 21:26–1CH 22:1

## 1 Chronicles 22:2–19 (id: 13573)

God promised David that his kingdom would last forever and that his son would build a temple for the Lord ([1 Chronicles 17:11–12](https://ref.ly/1Chr17:11-1Chr17:12)). After choosing the site ([1 Chronicles 21:18–22:1](https://ref.ly/1Chr21:18-1Chr22:1)), David prepared to build the temple of God. He gathered materials ([1 Chronicles 22:2–5](https://ref.ly/1Chr22:2-1Chr22:5)) and instructed Solomon ([22:6–16](https://ref.ly/1Chr22:6-1Chr22:16)) and the leaders of Israel ([22:17–19](https://ref.ly/1Chr22:17-1Chr22:19)) to build the temple after his death.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 22:2–1CH 22:19

## 1 Chronicles 22:5 (id: 13574)

When Solomon was young and inexperienced (see also [1 Chronicles 29:1](https://ref.ly/1Chr29:1); compare [1 Kings 3:7](https://ref.ly/1Kgs3:7); [2 Chronicles 13:7](https://ref.ly/2Chr13:7)), David used his wisdom and skill to prepare for building the temple. David also designed the temple ([1 Chronicles 28:11–12](https://ref.ly/1Chr28:11-1Chr28:12)). Later, God gave Solomon the wisdom he needed to build the temple and govern well (see [2 Chronicles 1:7–12](https://ref.ly/2Chr1:7-2Chr1:12)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 22:5

## 1 Chronicles 22:8 (id: 13575)

God did not allow David to build the temple because he had shed much blood (see [1 Kings 5:3–4](https://ref.ly/1Kgs5:3-1Kgs5:4)). David's wars were not wrong, and God had blessed and supported them. However, the bloodshed and deaths in battle made David ceremonially unclean (see [1 Chronicles 28:3](https://ref.ly/1Chr28:3); compare [Genesis 4:10–12](https://ref.ly/Gen4:10-Gen4:12); [Leviticus 17:3–4](https://ref.ly/Lev17:3-Lev17:4); [Deuteronomy 21:1–9](https://ref.ly/Deut21:1-Deut21:9); [Matthew 27:24–25](https://ref.ly/Matt27:24-Matt27:25)). Therefore, he could not build a holy sanctuary for the Lord.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 22:8

## 1 Chronicles 22:9–10 (id: 13576)

* Solomon was a man of peace, avoiding war and bloodshed in battle. The temple was constructed during his peaceful rule (see [2 Chronicles 2–7](https://ref.ly/2Chr2:1-2Chr7:22)).
* The Hebrew text uses two different words to describe conditions during Solomon’s reign:

    + *peace* (Hebrew *shalom*, related to Solomon’s name)
        + *quiet* (Hebrew *menukhah*, related to the idea of redemption)

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 22:9–1CH 22:10

## 1 Chronicles 23:1–2 (id: 13577)

* When David appointed his son Solomon as Israel’s king (see [1 Kings 1](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:1-1Kgs1:53)), he outlined the kingdom's organizational structure and made provisions for the temple's operation.
* The account of Solomon’s coronation continues in [1 Chronicles 28–29](https://ref.ly/1Chr28:1-1Chr29:30); the chapters in between ([23:3–27:24](https://ref.ly/1Chr23:3-1Chr27:24)) detail the kingdom's organization.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 23:3–1CH 23:5

## 1 Chronicles 23:6–23 (id: 13581)

David organized the Levites into groups based on their family lines. There were more clerics than needed for one temple. These groups allowed all priests and Levites to take turns serving in the temple (see[Luke 1:5](https://ref.ly/Luke1:5), [8](https://ref.ly/Luke1:8)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 23:6–1CH 23:23

## 1 Chronicles 23:24–27 (id: 13578)

In the census of [1 Chronicles 23:3](https://ref.ly/1Chr23:3), individuals were counted at age thirty. However, the registration of the divisions included those who were twenty years old or older (see [Numbers 1:3](https://ref.ly/Num1:3)). The age for starting Levitical service seemed to change over time based on need.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 23:24–1CH 23:27

## 1 Chronicles 23:28–32 (id: 13579)

The Levites helped the priests in many ways. They maintained the temple, arranged the sacred bread and other offerings, sang, and assisted with sacrifices. Different family groups of Levites had specific duties ([1 Chronicles 23:4–6](https://ref.ly/1Chr23:4-1Chr23:6)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 23:28–1CH 23:32

## 1 Chronicles 24:1–2 (id: 13583)

The priests were organized into divisions for service, starting with Aaron’s sons, Eleazar and Ithamar. All of Israel’s priests came from these two men.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 24:1–1CH 24:2

## 1 Chronicles 24:1–19 (id: 13582)

The information about the priests’ duties only covers their organization into orders and how they assign responsibilities by casting lots. The Chronicler does not explain their duties because these were well established long ago (see [Exodus 28:1–5](https://ref.ly/Exod28:1-Exod28:5); [Leviticus 1–7](https://ref.ly/Lev1:1-Lev7:38); [Numbers 6:22–27](https://ref.ly/Num6:22-Num6:27)).

Zadok and Ahimelech led the two priestly families during King David's time (see [1 Chronicles 6:8](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:8); [18:16](https://ref.ly/1Chr18:16); [2 Samuel 8:17](https://ref.ly/2Sam8:17)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 24:3–1CH 24:6

## 1 Chronicles 24:7–18 (id: 13587)

The twenty\-four divisions for the priests stayed the same for many generations. The order of Abijah ([1 Chronicles 24:10](https://ref.ly/1Chr24:10)) is mentioned in [Luke 1:5](https://ref.ly/Luke1:5), [8](https://ref.ly/Luke1:8).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 24:7–1CH 24:18

The other family leaders might refer to tribe members who were not priests but had been documented (see [1 Chronicles 23:6–23](https://ref.ly/1Chr23:6-1Chr23:23)), or it might refer to Levites not mentioned before. However, most families were already in the previous list. Therefore, this list seems to be a separate, additional list that complements the earlier register of Levites, possibly updating it at a later time.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 24:20–1CH 24:31

## 1 Chronicles 27:1–15 (id: 13597)

David organized his reserve army into twelve divisions. Each division served for one month each year. Their duties likely included protecting borders, policing, maintaining order in conquered areas, manning fortresses, and taking care of military equipment like horses and chariots. The divisions were not based on Israel’s tribal structure. Each division included people from different tribes, showing the kingdom's integration.

## 1 Chronicles 28:2 (id: 13608)

David described the temple as a place where the ark of the Lord’s covenant could rest. The word "rest" signifies the conquest of the land and the establishment of peace (for example, [Deuteronomy 12:9](https://ref.ly/Deut12:9)). In the wilderness, the ark rested after battles ([Numbers 10:35–36](https://ref.ly/Num10:35-Num10:36)). When David brought the ark to Jerusalem, its "rest" became permanent. David expressed this in a psalm of worship: *Arise, O LORD, to Your resting place, You and the ark of Your strength* ([Psalm 132:8](https://ref.ly/Ps132:8)). God chose Mount Zion as his resting place.

## 1 Chronicles 28:9–10 (id: 13610)

David's message to Solomon focused on the responsibilities of becoming king, not the privileges. Solomon's main duty was to seek, worship, and serve the Lord. The Lord also demanded a strong commitment to building the temple sanctuary.

In God's throne room, the most holy place of Israel's sanctuary, *cherubim* on top of the ark of the covenant served a similar role (see [Exodus 25:18–22](https://ref.ly/Exod25:18-Exod25:22); [2 Samuel 6:2](https://ref.ly/2Sam6:2); [Psalm 99:1](https://ref.ly/Ps99:1); compare [Ezekiel 10](https://ref.ly/Ezek10:1-Ezek10:22)).

## 1 Chronicles 29:1–9 (id: 13611)

David convinced Israel's leaders ([1 Chronicles 28:1](https://ref.ly/1Chr28:1)) to give gifts to the Lord for the temple. David's generous gift set an example for the leaders. The Chronicler highlights that Solomon did not bear the heavy cost of building the temple alone. Solomon added to the contributions made by David and Israel's leaders (see [1 Chronicles 22:14](https://ref.ly/1Chr22:14)).

*10,000 darics of gold*: Persian *darics* were first minted during the reign of King Darius I of Persia, who ruled from 522 to 486 BC. When describing the temple gifts during Solomon's time, the Chronicler updated the information to match his era, similar to how the New Living Translation converts Hebrew weights and measures to modern equivalents.

## 1 Chronicles 29:10–19 (id: 13612)

David’s prayer of praise ended his speeches at Solomon’s coronation. The prayer praises God’s power and the glory of his kingdom*,* and it dedicates the offerings for building the temple. The prayer has three parts: 

1. The doxology ([1 Chronicles 29:10b–13](https://ref.ly/1Chr29:10-1Chr29:13))
2. The presentation and dedication of the offerings ([1 Chronicles 29:14–17](https://ref.ly/1Chr29:14-1Chr29:17))
3. The petition ([1 Chronicles 29:18–19](https://ref.ly/1Chr29:18-1Chr29:19))

## 1 Chronicles 29:18–19 (id: 13613)

David did not ask God for power, victory, or riches, nor for Solomon's kingdom to be established. Instead, he asked God to help the people of Israel, especially Solomon, always want to obey the Lord. Having this kind of heart is a gift from the Lord; success and prosperity come second.

## 1 Chronicles 29:21–25 (id: 13614)

After the speeches and prayers at Solomon's coronation, sacrifices took place. Solomon and Zadok were anointed, and Solomon took the throne. Zadok was not starting his priestly role but was dedicated to serve in the temple itself. (The descendants of Zadok are mentioned in [Ezekiel 40:46](https://ref.ly/Ezek40:46); [43:19](https://ref.ly/Ezek43:19); [44:15](https://ref.ly/Ezek44:15); [48:11](https://ref.ly/Ezek48:11).)

## 1 Chronicles 29:26–30 (id: 13615)

The Chronicler ends his account of David’s reign with a formal summary, similar to those for all the kings of Israel and Judah (for example, [1 Kings 22:41–50](https://ref.ly/1Kgs22:41-1Kgs22:50)). Like Abraham ([Genesis 25:8](https://ref.ly/Gen25:8)) and Isaac ([Genesis 35:29](https://ref.ly/Gen35:29)), David died at an old age with wealth and honor.

3. Gad ([1 Chronicles 21:9](https://ref.ly/1Chr21:9))

The Chronicler also used other sources besides the books of Samuel and Kings (see study note on 1 Chronicles 9:1; see also [1 Kings 11:41–43](https://ref.ly/1Kgs11:41-1Kgs11:43); [14:19–20](https://ref.ly/1Kgs14:19-1Kgs14:20), [29–31](https://ref.ly/1Kgs14:29-1Kgs14:31)).
