## Ecclesiastes 1:1 (id: 10607)

Ecclesiastes does not mention the Teacher's name (*Qoheleth* in Hebrew), but King David's son likely refers to Solomon (see also [Ecclesiastes 1:12](https://ref.ly/Eccl1:12), [16](https://ref.ly/Eccl1:16); [2:4–9](https://ref.ly/Eccl2:4-Eccl2:9)).

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 1:1
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Ecclesiastes 1:2 (id: 10609)

*Futility of futilities...Everything is futile* (literally *vapor of vapors*): Whenever "meaningless" appears in this book, it translates the Hebrew word *hebel*, which means "breath" or "vapor." The Teacher concludes that everything is temporary and lacks meaning, like vapor.

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 1:2
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Ecclesiastes 1:2–11 (id: 10608)

The Teacher starts by noting that every natural and historical activity has a repetitive cycle of coming and going, existing and not existing. This can cause some to feel that everything is meaningless. The Teacher quickly shifts from one topic to another and ends this section with the topic he began with, using a literary style that reflects the cycles he describes in nature and human history.

## Ecclesiastes 1:3 (id: 10610)

The Hebrew phrase *under the sun* appears twenty\-nine times in Ecclesiastes. The New Living Translation sometimes translates it as "here on earth" ([Proverbs 2:18](https://ref.ly/Eccl2:18)) or "in this world" ([Proverbs 2:20](https://ref.ly/Eccl2:20)). It suggests a view of life focused on earthly matters rather than God's perspective.

## Ecclesiastes 1:13 (id: 10605)

*What a miserable task God has laid*: The harsh truths of human experience remind us of the Fall in Eden ([Genesis 3](https://ref.ly/Gen3:1-Gen3:24)). Ecclesiastes does not avoid sad topics like death, oppression, and loneliness. Instead, it faces them directly and includes them in realistic conclusions.

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 2:1–ECC 2:11
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Ecclesiastes 2:3 (id: 10659)

* The Teacher realized that using wine to cheer himself was foolish, yet he did it while still seeking wisdom. He wanted to understand how to find happiness. This effort turned out to be pointless ([Ecclesiastes 2:11](https://ref.ly/Eccl2:11)).
* *the few days of their lives*: All human experiences are like "a breath."

Solomon built both small structures like porches and gates and large ones like entire cities (see [1 Kings 9:15–19](https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:15-1Kgs9:19)).

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 2:12

## Ecclesiastes 2:12–23 (id: 10649)

The Teacher now examines the value of wisdom ([Ecclesiastes 2:12–17](https://ref.ly/Eccl2:12-Eccl2:17)) and hard work ([2:18–23](https://ref.ly/Eccl2:18-Eccl2:23)). These, too, are futile ([Ecclesiastes 2:17](https://ref.ly/Eccl2:17)).

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 2:12–ECC 2:23
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Ecclesiastes 2:13–14 (id: 10651)

*wisdom exceeds folly*: Wisdom is useful because it helps navigate life successfully. However, it cannot prevent death or give life meaning ([Ecclesiastes 2:15–16](https://ref.ly/Eccl2:15-Eccl2:16)).

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 2:13–ECC 2:14
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Ecclesiastes 2:15–16 (id: 10652)

* *The fate of the fool will also befall me. What then have I gained by being wise?*: Since the lives of both are short, the conclusion is that everything is meaningless.
* *both will be forgotten*: Future generations will not remember us or our achievements, so our efforts will amount to nothing (compare [Ecclesiastes 1:11](https://ref.ly/Eccl1:11); [9:13–16](https://ref.ly/Eccl9:13-Eccl9:16)).

The Teacher began to dislike life because of its:

* Hard work ([Ecclesiastes 2:18](https://ref.ly/Eccl2:18))
* Seeming pointlessness ([Ecclesiastes 2:19–20](https://ref.ly/Eccl2:19-Eccl2:20))

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 2:17–ECC 2:20
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Ecclesiastes 2:19 (id: 10654)

Foolish and destructive successors pose a greater threat to wise accomplishments than wise successors do. However, since the Teacher could not predict the type of successors he would have, his accomplishments felt meaningless to him. Solomon's immediate successor, his son Rehoboam, turned out to be foolish (see [1 Kings 12:1–20](https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:1-1Kgs12:20)).

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 2:19

Even though life *under the sun* ([Ecclesiastes 1:3](https://ref.ly/Eccl1:3)) is like a vapor ([2:23](https://ref.ly/Eccl2:23), *futile*), we should enjoy God's gifts of food, work, and wisdom.

## Ecclesiastes 3:1–8 (id: 10665)

*To everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under heaven*: Wisdom knows that everything has its own time. Both in human activities and in nature (see [Ecclesiastes 1:3–7](https://ref.ly/Eccl1:3-Eccl1:7)). A wise person knows when to start any activity ([Ecclesiastes 8:5](https://ref.ly/Eccl8:5)). Opportunities do not last long ([Ephesians 5:16](https://ref.ly/Eph5:16); [Colossians 4:5](https://ref.ly/Col4:5)).

Every activity has a right time ([Ecclesiastes 3:1–8](https://ref.ly/Eccl3:1-Eccl3:8)), but only God knows when that time is ([Ecclesiastes 3:9–11](https://ref.ly/Eccl3:9-Eccl3:11)). People should accept uncertainty and trust God, who rewards wise and righteous work with enjoyment.

*the burden that God has laid upon the sons of men*: God made our work harder after humans rebelled against Him ([Genesis 3:17–19](https://ref.ly/Gen3:17-Gen3:19)). This burden is not too heavy for us to enjoy our work and its rewards ([Ecclesiastes 3:11213](https://ref.ly/Eccl3:11-Eccl3:13)).

* **Associated Articles:**

* *He has made everything beautiful in its time*: We can sometimes see this beauty in our work and the world. However, many people cannot see it. God keeps the understanding of how everything fits together for himself (see [Romans 8:22–28](https://ref.ly/Rom8:22-Rom8:28)).

Most people are driven to succeed by competition. Since the rewards have no real value, the Teacher suggests moderation ([Ecclesiastes 4:5–6](https://ref.ly/Eccl4:5-Eccl4:6)) instead of envy.

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 4:4
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Ecclesiastes 4:5–6 (id: 10686)

Fools do not try to succeed and end up poor. Others work frantically, using all their time and effort, to chase temporary wealth they will not have time to enjoy (compare [Proverbs 23:4–5](https://ref.ly/Prov23:4-Prov23:5)). Wise people practice moderation and contentment (*tranquility*).

*for one official is watched by a superior, and others higher still are over them. The produce of the earth is taken by all; the king himself profits from the fields*: The New Living Translation sees these verses as saying that bureaucracy causes oppression instead of justice, even up to the king (see also [1 Samuel 8:11–18](https://ref.ly/1Sam8:11-1Sam8:18)). This is not surprising because bureaucracies often work this way. Others interpret the verses to mean that the king and his officials oversee to prevent injustice and oppression. The first view aligns more with the Teacher's realistic perspective.
