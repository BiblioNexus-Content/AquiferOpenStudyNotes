--------------------------------

## Ecclesiastes 1:1 (id: 10607)

Ecclesiastes does not mention the Teacher's name (*Qoheleth* in Hebrew), but King David's son likely refers to Solomon (see also [Ecclesiastes 1:12](https://ref.ly/Eccl1:12), [16](https://ref.ly/Eccl1:16); [2:4–9](https://ref.ly/Eccl2:4-Eccl2:9)).

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 1:1

## Ecclesiastes 1:2 (id: 10609)

*Futility of futilities...Everything is futile* (literally *vapor of vapors*): Whenever "meaningless" appears in this book, it translates the Hebrew word *hebel*, which means "breath" or "vapor." The Teacher concludes that everything is temporary and lacks meaning, like vapor.

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 1:2

## Ecclesiastes 1:2–11 (id: 10608)

The Teacher starts by noting that every natural and historical activity has a repetitive cycle of coming and going, existing and not existing. This can cause some to feel that everything is meaningless. The Teacher quickly shifts from one topic to another and ends this section with the topic he began with, using a literary style that reflects the cycles he describes in nature and human history.

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 1:2–ECC 1:11

## Ecclesiastes 1:3 (id: 10610)

The Hebrew phrase *under the sun* appears twenty\-nine times in Ecclesiastes. The New Living Translation sometimes translates it as "here on earth" ([Proverbs 2:18](https://ref.ly/Eccl2:18)) or "in this world" ([Proverbs 2:20](https://ref.ly/Eccl2:20)). It suggests a view of life focused on earthly matters rather than God's perspective.

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 1:3

## Ecclesiastes 1:4 (id: 10611)

Generations come and go, and individual lives often seem to pass without importance.

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 1:4

## Ecclesiastes 1:7–8 (id: 10612)

The sea is never full, and we are never satisfied. This image shows how life can feel unfulfilling.

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 1:7–ECC 1:8

## Ecclesiastes 1:11 (id: 10603)

*There is no remembrance*: We cannot rely on others to remember what we believe we have accomplished.

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 1:11

## Ecclesiastes 1:12–2.26 (id: 10604)

The Teacher examines how wisdom, work, and pleasure relate to each other.

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 1:12–ECC 2:26

## Ecclesiastes 1:13 (id: 10605)

*What a miserable task God has laid*: The harsh truths of human experience remind us of the Fall in Eden ([Genesis 3](https://ref.ly/Gen3:1-Gen3:24)). Ecclesiastes does not avoid sad topics like death, oppression, and loneliness. Instead, it faces them directly and includes them in realistic conclusions.

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 1:13

## Ecclesiastes 1:14 (id: 10606)

*a pursuit of the wind.*: Life comes and goes quickly, just like the wind.

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 1:14

## Ecclesiastes 2:1–11 (id: 10646)

The Teacher says seeking pleasure for its own sake is empty. Even great achievements are like smoke.

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 2:1–ECC 2:11

## Ecclesiastes 2:3 (id: 10659)

* The Teacher realized that using wine to cheer himself was foolish, yet he did it while still seeking wisdom. He wanted to understand how to find happiness. This effort turned out to be pointless ([Ecclesiastes 2:11](https://ref.ly/Eccl2:11)).
* *the few days of their lives*: All human experiences are like "a breath."

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 2:3

## Ecclesiastes 2:4 (id: 10661)

The Bible mentions Solomon's vineyards in [Song of Solomon 8:11–12](https://ref.ly/Song8:11-Song8:12).

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 2:4

## Ecclesiastes 2:4–8 (id: 10660)

Solomon built both small structures like porches and gates and large ones like entire cities (see [1 Kings 9:15–19](https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:15-1Kgs9:19)). He mainly built these projects for his own enjoyment, including the palace and its related buildings (see [1 Kings 7:1–12](https://ref.ly/1Kgs7:1-1Kgs7:12)).

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 2:4–ECC 2:8

## Ecclesiastes 2:7 (id: 10662)

Solomon's slaves managed large herds and flocks. Caring for them used many resources ([1 Kings 4:22–23](https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:22-1Kgs4:23); [9:20–21](https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:20-1Kgs9:21)).

## Ecclesiastes 2:8 (id: 10663)

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 2:8

## Ecclesiastes 2:9 (id: 10664)

*I became great*: Compare [1 Kings 10:23](https://ref.ly/1Kgs10:23).

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 2:9

## Ecclesiastes 2:10 (id: 10647)

*For my heart took delight in all my work*: The Teacher highlights a key theme: Joy comes from wise and diligent work ([Ecclesiastes 5:12](https://ref.ly/Eccl5:12), [18–20](https://ref.ly/Eccl5:18-Eccl5:20)).

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 2:10

## Ecclesiastes 2:11 (id: 10648)

*futile...nothing to be gained*: Accomplishments may lead to hopelessness and discouragement because they lack lasting meaning ([Ecclesiastes 2:18–23](https://ref.ly/Eccl2:18-Eccl2:23)).

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 2:11

## Ecclesiastes 2:12 (id: 10650)

*what more can the king’s successor do than what has already been accomplished?*: After the Teacher, no one will have a better way to compare wisdom and foolishness because nothing new will happen under the sun ([Ecclesiastes 1:9–10](https://ref.ly/Eccl1:9-Eccl1:10)).

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 2:12

## Ecclesiastes 2:12–23 (id: 10649)

The Teacher now examines the value of wisdom ([Ecclesiastes 2:12–17](https://ref.ly/Eccl2:12-Eccl2:17)) and hard work ([2:18–23](https://ref.ly/Eccl2:18-Eccl2:23)). These, too, are futile ([Ecclesiastes 2:17](https://ref.ly/Eccl2:17)).

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 2:12–ECC 2:23

## Ecclesiastes 2:13–14 (id: 10651)

*wisdom exceeds folly*: Wisdom is useful because it helps navigate life successfully. However, it cannot prevent death or give life meaning ([Ecclesiastes 2:15–16](https://ref.ly/Eccl2:15-Eccl2:16)).

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 2:13–ECC 2:14

## Ecclesiastes 2:15–16 (id: 10652)

* *The fate of the fool will also befall me. What then have I gained by being wise?*: Since the lives of both are short, the conclusion is that everything is meaningless.
* *both will be forgotten*: Future generations will not remember us or our achievements, so our efforts will amount to nothing (compare [Ecclesiastes 1:11](https://ref.ly/Eccl1:11); [9:13–16](https://ref.ly/Eccl9:13-Eccl9:16)).

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 2:15–ECC 2:16

## Ecclesiastes 2:17–20 (id: 10653)

The Teacher began to dislike life because of its: 

* Sorrows ([Ecclesiastes 1:18](https://ref.ly/Eccl1:18))
* Hard work ([Ecclesiastes 2:18](https://ref.ly/Eccl2:18))
* Seeming pointlessness ([Ecclesiastes 2:19–20](https://ref.ly/Eccl2:19-Eccl2:20))

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 2:17–ECC 2:20

## Ecclesiastes 2:19 (id: 10654)

Foolish and destructive successors pose a greater threat to wise accomplishments than wise successors do. However, since the Teacher could not predict the type of successors he would have, his accomplishments felt meaningless to him. Solomon's immediate successor, his son Rehoboam, turned out to be foolish (see [1 Kings 12:1–20](https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:1-1Kgs12:20)).

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 2:19

## Ecclesiastes 2:21 (id: 10655)

* *labored with wisdom, knowledge, and skill*: Skill in work shows wisdom (for example, see [Exodus 31:1–5](https://ref.ly/Exod31:1-Exod31:5)).
* *give his portion to a man who has not worked for it*: A person with little personal investment tends to waste it or take foolish risks.

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 2:21

## Ecclesiastes 2:24 (id: 10657)

*this is from the hand of God*: Do not overlook God's gifts, like enjoying food and work. Without God, these would not exist. We can be thankful and content.

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 2:24

## Ecclesiastes 2:24–26 (id: 10656)

Even though life *under the sun* ([Ecclesiastes 1:3](https://ref.ly/Eccl1:3)) is like a vapor ([2:23](https://ref.ly/Eccl2:23), *futile*), we should enjoy God's gifts of food, work, and wisdom.

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 2:24–ECC 2:26

## Ecclesiastes 2:26 (id: 10658)

If a sinner becomes wealthy*,* it is meaningless because God takes the wealth away.

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 2:26

## Ecclesiastes 3:1–8 (id: 10665)

*To everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under heaven*: Wisdom knows that everything has its own time. Both in human activities and in nature (see [Ecclesiastes 1:3–7](https://ref.ly/Eccl1:3-Eccl1:7)). A wise person knows when to start any activity ([Ecclesiastes 8:5](https://ref.ly/Eccl8:5)). Opportunities do not last long ([Ephesians 5:16](https://ref.ly/Eph5:16); [Colossians 4:5](https://ref.ly/Col4:5)).

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 3:1–ECC 3:8

## Ecclesiastes 3:2–8 (id: 10675)

*gain from his toil?*: See [Ecclesiastes 3:12–13](https://ref.ly/Eccl3:12-Eccl3:13).

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 3:9

## Ecclesiastes 3:9–14 (id: 10679)

Every activity has a right time ([Ecclesiastes 3:1–8](https://ref.ly/Eccl3:1-Eccl3:8)), but only God knows when that time is ([Ecclesiastes 3:9–11](https://ref.ly/Eccl3:9-Eccl3:11)). People should accept uncertainty and trust God, who rewards wise and righteous work with enjoyment.

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 3:9–ECC 3:14

## Ecclesiastes 3:10 (id: 10666)

*the burden that God has laid upon the sons of men*: God made our work harder after humans rebelled against Him ([Genesis 3:17–19](https://ref.ly/Gen3:17-Gen3:19)). This burden is not too heavy for us to enjoy our work and its rewards ([Ecclesiastes 3:11213](https://ref.ly/Eccl3:11-Eccl3:13)).

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 3:10

## Ecclesiastes 3:11 (id: 10667)

* *He has made everything beautiful in its time*: We can sometimes see this beauty in our work and the world. However, many people cannot see it. God keeps the understanding of how everything fits together for himself (see [Romans 8:22–28](https://ref.ly/Rom8:22-Rom8:28)).
* God has planted eternity, an awareness of the infinite, within each of us. This is enough for us to be in awe of him who is infinite and eternal, and enough to hope for eternal life after death.

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 3:11

## Ecclesiastes 3:12–13 (id: 10668)

*rejoice and do good while they live*: Even though life and work can be hard, the Teacher's conclusion (repeated from [Ecclesiastes 2:24](https://ref.ly/Eccl2:24)) can still be true.

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 3:12–ECC 3:13

*what will be has already been*: The same events repeat throughout history ([Ecclesiastes 1:9–10](https://ref.ly/Eccl1:9-Eccl1:10)) which is part of God's plan.

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 3:15

## Ecclesiastes 3:16 (id: 10672)

*the place of justice*: In ancient Israel, local court proceedings took place at the city gates. The city’s elders sat there to hear and decide legal matters (for example, see [Ruth 4:1–12](https://ref.ly/Ruth4:1-Ruth4:12)).

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 3:16

## Ecclesiastes 3:17 (id: 10673)

*God will judge*: Human injustices ([Ecclesiastes 3:16](https://ref.ly/Eccl3:16)) are temporary and God will correct them. The narrator repeats this to conclude the book ([Ecclesiastes 12:14](https://ref.ly/Eccl12:14)).

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 3:17

## Ecclesiastes 3:19 (id: 10674)

When it comes to breathing and dying, people are like animals*,* but we have other advantages (for example, see [Genesis 1:26–28](https://ref.ly/Gen1:26-Gen1:28)).

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 3:21

## Ecclesiastes 3:22 (id: 10678)

*enjoy his work*: Work is now a separate source of enjoyment, different from food and drink (compare [Ecclesiastes 2:24–25](https://ref.ly/Eccl2:24-Eccl2:25); [3:12–13](https://ref.ly/Eccl3:12-Eccl3:13)).

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 3:22

In places with oppression, the dead are better off than the living. The dead no longer suffer mistreatment.

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 4:2

## Ecclesiastes 4:4 (id: 10685)

Most people are driven to succeed by competition. Since the rewards have no real value, the Teacher suggests moderation ([Ecclesiastes 4:5–6](https://ref.ly/Eccl4:5-Eccl4:6)) instead of envy.

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 4:4

## Ecclesiastes 4:5–6 (id: 10686)

Fools do not try to succeed and end up poor. Others work frantically, using all their time and effort, to chase temporary wealth they will not have time to enjoy (compare [Proverbs 23:4–5](https://ref.ly/Prov23:4-Prov23:5)). Wise people practice moderation and contentment (*tranquility*).

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 4:5–ECC 4:6

## Ecclesiastes 4:7–8 (id: 10687)

This lonely man is an example of the idea in [Ecclesiastes 4:6](https://ref.ly/Eccl4:6).

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 4:7–ECC 4:8

## Ecclesiastes 4:9–12 (id: 10688)

*Two are better than one*: The solitary man ([Ecclesiastes 4:8](https://ref.ly/Eccl4:8)) reminds us of the benefits of partnerships in business and personal life.

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 4:9–ECC 4:12

## Ecclesiastes 4:13–14 (id: 10681)

*Better is a...wise youth*: Wisdom is valuable because it helps in real\-life situations.

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 4:13–ECC 4:14

## Ecclesiastes 4:15–16 (id: 10682)

A ruler's popularity is temporary and fleeting, like the wind.

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 4:15–ECC 4:16

## Ecclesiastes 5:1 (id: 10694)

The house of God offers a chance for respectful words and thoughtful promises, but it is mainly a place for listening.

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 5:1

## Ecclesiastes 5:3 (id: 10695)

*many cares...many words*: We should aim for moderation in our actions and speech (see [Proverbs 10:19](https://ref.ly/Prov10:19)).

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 5:3

## Ecclesiastes 5:4–5 (id: 10696)

*Fulfill your vow*: This is almost a direct quote from the law ([Deuteronomy 23:21–23](https://ref.ly/Deut23:21-Deut23:23); see also [Proverbs 12:22](https://ref.ly/Prov12:22); [20:25](https://ref.ly/Prov20:25)). Vows to God were voluntary, but once made, you had to keep them.

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 5:4–ECC 5:5

## Ecclesiastes 5:7 (id: 10697)

*fear God*: Respecting God is the basis for meaningful words and helpful actions (see [Ecclesiastes 12:1](https://ref.ly/Eccl12:1); [Proverbs 1:7](https://ref.ly/Prov1:7)).

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 5:7

## Ecclesiastes 5:8–9 (id: 10698)

*for one official is watched by a superior, and others higher still are over them. The produce of the earth is taken by all; the king himself profits from the fields*: The New Living Translation sees these verses as saying that bureaucracy causes oppression instead of justice, even up to the king (see also [1 Samuel 8:11–18](https://ref.ly/1Sam8:11-1Sam8:18)). This is not surprising because bureaucracies often work this way. Others interpret the verses to mean that the king and his officials oversee to prevent injustice and oppression. The first view aligns more with the Teacher's realistic perspective.

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 5:8–ECC 5:9

## Ecclesiastes 5:10 (id: 10689)

We are spiritual and physical beings, so possessions and wealth cannot fully satisfy us.

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 5:10

## Ecclesiastes 5:12 (id: 10690)

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 5:12

## Ecclesiastes 5:13–14 (id: 10691)

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 5:13–ECC 5:14

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 5:16–ECC 5:17

## Ecclesiastes 5:18–20 (id: 10693)

The advice for enjoying life is clear: Enjoy your food, drink, and work. Appreciate them as gifts from God.

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 5:18–ECC 5:20

## Ecclesiastes 6:1–2 (id: 10699)

This parable of the "unfortunate man" is similar to [Ecclesiastes 4:7–8](https://ref.ly/Eccl4:7-Eccl4:8) and [5:13–17](https://ref.ly/Eccl5:13-Eccl5:17). It is a sad tragedy when someone succeeds but cannot enjoy their success. This person misses the only real benefit of success.

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 6:1–ECC 6:2

## Ecclesiastes 6:3–6 (id: 10704)

*a hundred children and live for many years*: The blessings of old age and children mean nothing if life is not enjoyable or does not end well with a proper burial. It is better to be stillborn than to live a life full of unhappiness.

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 6:3–ECC 6:6

## Ecclesiastes 6:7 (id: 10705)

People often feel unsatisfied with what they have, regardless of the amount (compare [Ecclesiastes 5:10](https://ref.ly/Eccl5:10)).

* *he cannot contend with one stronger than he*: See[Romans 9:20–24](https://ref.ly/Rom9:20-Rom9:24).

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 6:10

## Ecclesiastes 6:10–7.22 (id: 10700)

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 6:10–ECC 7:22

## Ecclesiastes 6:11 (id: 10702)

*For the more words, the more futility*: Compare with [Proverbs 10:19](https://ref.ly/Prov10:19) and [Proverbs 17:28](https://ref.ly/Prov17:28).

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 6:11

## Ecclesiastes 6:12 (id: 10703)

* *Who knows?... Who can tell?*: These questions have already been answered. We should spend our days living wisely, enjoying our work, and appreciating God's gifts ([Ecclesiastes 2:13–14](https://ref.ly/Eccl2:13-Eccl2:14), [24](https://ref.ly/Eccl2:24); [3:22](https://ref.ly/Eccl3:22); [5:18](https://ref.ly/Eccl5:18)). What will happen on this earth has already happened ([Ecclesiastes 1:9](https://ref.ly/Eccl1:9), [10](https://ref.ly/Eccl1:10); [3:15](https://ref.ly/Eccl3:15)).
* *like a shadow*: Compare [Psalms 39:4–6](https://ref.ly/Ps39:4-Ps39:6); [90:3–6](https://ref.ly/Ps90:3-Ps90:6), [10–12](https://ref.ly/Ps90:10-Ps90:12); [109:23](https://ref.ly/Ps109:23); [144:4](https://ref.ly/Ps144:4).

* **Associated Passages:** ECC 6:12

## Ecclesiastes 7:1 (id: 10714)

* It is better to seek a good reputation for wisdom and righteousness than to pursue luxuries like expensive perfume ([Proverbs 22:1](https://ref.ly/Prov22:1); [28:6](https://ref.ly/Prov28:6)).
* *one’s day of death is better than his day of birth*: There is relief when life's troubles end. Life's difficulties can make one look forward to the peace of death ([Ecclesiastes 1:18](https://ref.ly/Eccl1:18); [2:22](https://ref.ly/Eccl2:22); [4:2–3](https://ref.ly/Eccl4:2-Eccl4:3); [12:1](https://ref.ly/Eccl12:1)).

It is unwise to engage in carefree fun when wisdom calls for serious reflection on death (see also [Ecclesiastes 2:12–13](https://ref.ly/Eccl2:12-Eccl2:13)).
