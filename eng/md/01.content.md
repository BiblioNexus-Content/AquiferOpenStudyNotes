## Genesis 1:1 (id: 12229)

In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth: This statement summarizes the entire creation account ([1:3–2:3](https://ref.ly/Gen1:3-Gen2:3)). Already a key question—Who created the world?—is answered (see also [Prov 8:22–31](https://ref.ly/Prov8:22-Prov8:31); [John 1:1–3](https://ref.ly/John1:1-John1:3)). Although the modern naturalistic mindset rejects this question and that of creation’s purpose, Genesis affirms God’s role and purpose in creation. • The common name for God (Hebrew ’elohim) emphasizes his grand supremacy. The word ’elohim is plural, but the verbs used with it are usually singular, reflecting the consistent scriptural proclamation of a single, all\-powerful God. • created (Hebrew bara’): In the Old Testament, God is always the agent of creation expressed by this verb. It describes the making of something fresh and new—notably the cosmos ([1:1](https://ref.ly/Gen1:1), [21](https://ref.ly/Gen1:21); [2:3](https://ref.ly/Gen2:3)), humankind ([1:27](https://ref.ly/Gen1:27)), the Israelite nation ([Isa 43:1](https://ref.ly/Isa43:1)), and the future new creation ([Isa 65:17](https://ref.ly/Isa65:17)). • The heavens and the earth are the entire ordered cosmos.

## Genesis 1:1–2.3 (id: 12225)

These verses introduce the Pentateuch (Genesis—Deuteronomy) and teach Israel that the world was created, ordered, and populated by the one true God and not by the gods of surrounding nations. • God blessed three specific things: animal life ([1:22–25](https://ref.ly/Gen1:22-Gen1:25)), human life ([1:27](https://ref.ly/Gen1:27)), and the Sabbath day ([2:3](https://ref.ly/Gen2:3)). This trilogy of blessings highlights the Creator’s plan: Humankind was made in God’s image to enjoy sovereign dominion over the creatures of the earth and to participate in God’s Sabbath rest.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 1:1–GEN 2:3

## Genesis 1:2 (id: 12236)

This verse gives the background for the summary in [1:1](https://ref.ly/Gen1:1) and the detailed description in [1:3–2:3](https://ref.ly/Gen1:3-Gen2:3). God’s creative utterances bring order to the chaotic state of the universe. • formless . . . empty (Hebrew tohu . . . bohu): This terse idiom means something like “wild and waste.” It sets a stark contrast to the final ordered state of the heavens and the earth ([1:1](https://ref.ly/Gen1:1)). • deep waters (Hebrew tehom): Some scholars say this alludes to the Mesopotamian goddess Tiamat (representing chaos), but Genesis views tehom as inhospitable chaos, not as a deity or goddess that God engaged in cosmic battle. • the Spirit of God: God directly superintended the creation process.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 1:2

## Genesis 1:3 (id: 12239)

Then God said: Nothing in ch [1](https://ref.ly/Gen1:1-Gen1:31) is created apart from God’s powerful word (cp. [Ps 33:6](https://ref.ly/Ps33:6), [9](https://ref.ly/Ps33:9)). • “Let there be . . .” and there was: God’s command enacted his will to create the world. God is not a part of creation or limited by it; he is the supreme ruler over everything (cp. [Neh 9:6](https://ref.ly/Neh9:6)).

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 1:3

## Genesis 1:3–13 (id: 12237)

In the first three days, God formed the chaos into a habitable world.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 1:3–GEN 1:13

## Genesis 1:4 (id: 12240)

Light is antithetical to chaotic darkness ([1:2](https://ref.ly/Gen1:2)); the light is declared good but the darkness is not (cp. [John 1:5](https://ref.ly/John1:5)). God is the source of this light (cp. [Gen 1:14–19](https://ref.ly/Gen1:14-Gen1:19)). God separated the light, as he did water (cp. [1:6–8](https://ref.ly/Gen1:6-Gen1:8)), by his creative word. Light is associated with life and blessing ([Job 38:19–20](https://ref.ly/Job38:19-Job38:20); [Pss 19:1–6](https://ref.ly/Ps19:1-Ps19:6); [97:11](https://ref.ly/Ps97:11); [104:19–20](https://ref.ly/Ps104:19-Ps104:20); [Isa 60:19–20](https://ref.ly/Isa60:19-Isa60:20)) and sets a boundary on the darkness that would destroy cosmic order. Darkness often typifies terror, death, and evil (see [Gen 15:12](https://ref.ly/Gen15:12); [Job 18:6](https://ref.ly/Job18:6), [18](https://ref.ly/Job18:18); [Ps 88:12](https://ref.ly/Ps88:12); [Eph 5:11–12](https://ref.ly/Eph5:11-Eph5:12); [1 Jn 1:5](https://ref.ly/1John1:5)).

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 1:4

## Genesis 1:5 (id: 12241)

God called (or *named*): To name something is to exercise authority over it (see also [2:19–20](https://ref.ly/Gen2:19-Gen2:20)). • day: The Hebrew yom can refer to daylight ([1:5a](https://ref.ly/Gen1:5)), to a 24\-hour period ([1:5b](https://ref.ly/Gen1:5)), or to an unspecified time period ([2:4b](https://ref.ly/Gen2:4), “When,” literally *in the day;* cp. [Exod 20:8–11](https://ref.ly/Exod20:8-Exod20:11)). • evening . . . morning: The Hebrew day began at sundown, just as the first day began with darkness and brought the first morning light.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 1:5

## Genesis 1:6–8 (id: 12242)

The creation account describes the appearance of things from a human perspective. The sky is viewed as a shiny dome that is a buffer between two collections of water (cp. [Job 37:18](https://ref.ly/Job37:18); [Ezek 1:22](https://ref.ly/Ezek1:22)). In the ancient Near East, the cosmos was understood as a three\-tier system, with rain originating from the outermost tier (see [Gen 7:11–12](https://ref.ly/Gen7:11-Gen7:12) and study note).

* **Associated Articles:** Genesis 7:11-12 (ID: `12957@TyndaleStudyNotes`)

## Genesis 1:9–10 (id: 12243)

Let the waters . . . flow together: Other ancient cultures viewed the sea as a hostile force. Genesis shows God as further restraining chaos (see study note on 1:2) by prescribing specific boundaries for the sea. The flood—an act of God’s judgment ([6:7](https://ref.ly/Gen6:7))—undid these boundaries and returned the earth to chaos ([7:1–24](https://ref.ly/Gen7:1-Gen7:24)).

* **Associated Articles:** Genesis 1:2 (ID: `12236@TyndaleStudyNotes`)

## Genesis 1:14 (id: 12227)

Let them . . . mark the seasons, days, and years: The movement of the heavenly bodies defined Israel’s liturgical calendar, whose roots in creation gave a sacred timing to Israel’s festivals and celebrations (see [Exod 23:15](https://ref.ly/Exod23:15); [Lev 23:4](https://ref.ly/Lev23:4)).

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 1:14

## Genesis 1:14–31 (id: 12226)

On days 4–6, God filled the domains that had been formed during days 1–3 ([1:3–13](https://ref.ly/Gen1:3-Gen1:13)).

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 1:14–GEN 1:31

## Genesis 1:16 (id: 12228)

In the surrounding pagan cultures, the two great lights were worshiped as deities, but in Genesis they serve God and humanity (see [Ps 136:7–9](https://ref.ly/Ps136:7-Ps136:9); [Jer 31:35](https://ref.ly/Jer31:35)). The sun and moon are not named; they are simply called the larger one and the smaller one. Not including their names may have reminded Israel that they were not gods. • govern: Cp. [1:26](https://ref.ly/Gen1:26), [28](https://ref.ly/Gen1:28); [Ps 136:9](https://ref.ly/Ps136:9). • the stars: The starry heavens testify to God’s creative power as they proclaim his glory ([Pss 19:1](https://ref.ly/Ps19:1); [148:3](https://ref.ly/Ps148:3)). They do not predict the future, as Israel’s neighbors believed (see [Jer 10:2](https://ref.ly/Jer10:2)).

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 1:16

## Genesis 1:21 (id: 12230)

Contrary to the pagan idea that the great sea creatures were co\-eternal with God, Genesis states that God created them and is sovereign over them. The Hebrew word tanninim (“creatures”) elsewhere refers to crocodiles ([Ezek 29:3](https://ref.ly/Ezek29:3)), powerful monsters ([Jer 51:34](https://ref.ly/Jer51:34)), or the sea creature Leviathan ([Isa 27:1](https://ref.ly/Isa27:1); cp. [Job 41:1–34](https://ref.ly/Job41:1-Job41:34)).

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 1:21

## Genesis 1:22 (id: 12231)

God blessed them: God’s blessing commissions and enables the fulfillment of what God has spoken (see “Blessing” Theme Note). • Let the fish . . . let the birds: These directives define the blessing. The fish and birds are fertile by God’s command, not by pagan ritual, as some of Israel’s neighbors thought.

* **Associated Articles:** Blessing (ID: `500163@TyndaleStudyNotesThemes`)

## Genesis 1:26 (id: 12232)

Let us make is more personal than the remote “Let there be” (e.g., [1:3](https://ref.ly/Gen1:3),[6](https://ref.ly/Gen1:6)). • The plural us has inspired several explanations: (1\) the Trinity; (2\) the plural to denote majesty; (3\) a plural to show deliberation with the self; and (4\) God speaking with his heavenly court of angels. The concept of the Trinity—one true God who exists eternally in three distinct persons—was revealed at a later stage in redemptive history, making it unlikely that the human author intended that here. Hebrew scholars generally dismiss the plural of majesty view because the grammar does not clearly support it (the plural of majesty has not been demonstrated to be communicated purely through a plural verb). The plural of self\-deliberation also lacks evidence; the only clear examples refer to Israel as a corporate unity (e.g., [2 Sam 24:14](https://ref.ly/2Sam24:14)). God’s speaking to the heavenly court, however, is well\-attested in the Old Testament (see [Gen 3:22](https://ref.ly/Gen3:22); [11:7](https://ref.ly/Gen11:7); [1 Kgs 22:19–22](https://ref.ly/1Kgs22:19-1Kgs22:22); [Job 1:6–12](https://ref.ly/Job1:6-Job1:12); [2:1–6](https://ref.ly/Job2:1-Job2:6); [38:7](https://ref.ly/Job38:7); [Ps 89:5–6](https://ref.ly/Ps89:5-Ps89:6); [Isa 6:1–8](https://ref.ly/Isa6:1-Isa6:8); [Dan 10:12–13](https://ref.ly/Dan10:12-Dan10:13)). • The descriptors in our image and like us are virtually synonymous in Hebrew. Humans enjoy a unique relationship with God. • They will reign: Humans represent the Creator as his ambassadors, vice\-regents, and administrators on earth.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 1:26

## Genesis 1:27 (id: 12233)

The first poetry of Genesis reflectively celebrates God’s climactic feat in creating humankind. • human beings: This term (Hebrew ha\-’adam, “the man”) is often used to denote humanity collectively (see [6:1](https://ref.ly/Gen6:1), [5–7](https://ref.ly/Gen6:5-Gen6:7); [9:5–6](https://ref.ly/Gen9:5-Gen9:6)). Though traditionally translated “man,” gender is not at issue here; both male and female are included.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 1:27

## Genesis 1:28 (id: 12234)

God blessed them: See study note on 1:22; see also [17:16](https://ref.ly/Gen17:16); [48:16](https://ref.ly/Gen48:16); [Deut 7:13](https://ref.ly/Deut7:13). • said: God’s message to humankind is direct and intimate; we are stewards of his delegated authority. • govern. . . . Reign: As God’s vice\-regents, humans are entrusted with the care and management of the world God created (see also [Gen 9:2](https://ref.ly/Gen9:2); [Ps 8:5–8](https://ref.ly/Ps8:5-Ps8:8)).

## Genesis 1:29–30 (id: 12235)

These verses highlight the extent (throughout the earth) and variety (every seed\-bearing plant . . . all the fruit trees) of God’s provision for humans, animals, and birds.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 1:29–GEN 1:30

## Genesis 1:31 (id: 12238)

The Creator declares his work good seven times in ch [1](https://ref.ly/Gen1:1-Gen1:31); following the creation of human beings, God declares it all very good.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 1:31

## Genesis 2:1–3 (id: 12395)

Humankind is the high point of God’s creative acts ([1:26–31](https://ref.ly/Gen1:26-Gen1:31)), while day 7 is the climax of the creation week. When God rested, he endorsed all of creation—there was nothing more to do! This seven\-day framework structured Israel’s week, with the seventh day as the precedent for their weekly Sabbath. The Sabbath was intended to celebrate God’s finished work; the seventh day would be set apart as holy and dedicated to the Creator, who also rested (see [Exod 20:8–11](https://ref.ly/Exod20:8-Exod20:11); [31:12–17](https://ref.ly/Exod31:12-Exod31:17); cp. [Matt 12:1–8](https://ref.ly/Matt12:1-Matt12:8); [Rom 14:5–6](https://ref.ly/Rom14:5-Rom14:6); [Col 2:16–17](https://ref.ly/Col2:16-Col2:17); [Heb 4:1–11](https://ref.ly/Heb4:1-Heb4:11)).

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 2:1–GEN 2:3

## Genesis 2:3 (id: 12410)

The first six days of creation involved separation (light from darkness, day from night, water from dry land). The last act of creation separated what is ordinary from what is holy, thus laying the foundation for Israel’s worship. It also anticipated a coming age of rest ([Heb 4:1–11](https://ref.ly/Heb4:1-Heb4:11); [12:2](https://ref.ly/Heb12:2); [13:14](https://ref.ly/Heb13:14)). • The absence of the usual “morning and evening” reflects the Creator’s willingness to enter into unending fellowship with humankind.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 2:3

## Genesis 2:4 (id: 12412)

This is the account (literally *These are the generations*; Hebrew toledoth): This or a similar phrase is repeated throughout Genesis, creating an internal outline for the book. In other occurrences, it introduces the genealogy or story of a key personality ([5:1](https://ref.ly/Gen5:1); [6:9](https://ref.ly/Gen6:9); [10:1](https://ref.ly/Gen10:1); [11:10](https://ref.ly/Gen11:10), [27](https://ref.ly/Gen11:27); [25:12](https://ref.ly/Gen25:12), [19](https://ref.ly/Gen25:19); [36:1](https://ref.ly/Gen36:1); [37:2](https://ref.ly/Gen37:2)). • Some have argued that the first half of [2:4](https://ref.ly/Gen2:4) belongs with [1:1–2:3](https://ref.ly/Gen1:1-Gen2:3), but it is more likely the introduction to the account that follows. • Lord God (Hebrew Yahweh Elohim) is the second name used for God in the early chapters of Genesis. Elohim ([1:1–2:3](https://ref.ly/Gen1:1-Gen2:3)) describes the all\-powerful creator God. Yahweh Elohim speaks of the eternal God who formed a lasting covenant with Israel ([Exod 3:6](https://ref.ly/Exod3:6), [13–15](https://ref.ly/Exod3:13-Exod3:15)). Accordingly, [Gen 2:4–25](https://ref.ly/Gen2:4-Gen2:25) focuses on God as provider more than as creator. The three themes of sexuality, dominion, and food in ch [1](https://ref.ly/Gen1:1-Gen1:31) are now addressed in reverse order (food, [2:8–17](https://ref.ly/Gen2:8-Gen2:17); dominion, [2:18–20](https://ref.ly/Gen2:18-Gen2:20); sexuality, [2:21–25](https://ref.ly/Gen2:21-Gen2:25)).

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 2:4

## Genesis 2:4–25 (id: 12411)

This account (see study note on 2:4) of the heavens and the earth is not a second creation account; rather, it is a theological and historical expansion on [1:1–2:3](https://ref.ly/Gen1:1-Gen2:3). The focus is now on what the cosmos produced rather than on its creation. Special attention is given to the first man and woman. As the story progresses, it is colored by contrasts of good and evil, knowledge and ignorance, life and death, harmony and discord.

## Genesis 2:5 (id: 12413)

Work does not result from sin; it was part of the original structure of creation and is directly tied to human identity and purpose ([1:28](https://ref.ly/Gen1:28); [2:15](https://ref.ly/Gen2:15)).

springs: The word refers to subterranean springs that rose to the surface of the ground.

## Genesis 2:7 (id: 12415)

In [1:1–2:3](https://ref.ly/Gen1:1-Gen2:3), creation happens at a distance, by divine command (“Let there be . . . and that is what happened”). In this account, the creative act is much more intimate (see also [2:8–9](https://ref.ly/Gen2:8-Gen2:9), [21–22](https://ref.ly/Gen2:21-Gen2:22)). • from the dust of the ground: In Hebrew, ’adamah (“ground”) forms a wordplay with ’adam (“man”). The earth remains the definitive reference point for humans, who in death return to dust ([3:17–19](https://ref.ly/Gen3:17-Gen3:19); [4:11](https://ref.ly/Gen4:11); [Job 4:19](https://ref.ly/Job4:19); [10:8–9](https://ref.ly/Job10:8-Job10:9); [Isa 29:16](https://ref.ly/Isa29:16)). • breathed . . . into the man’s nostrils: God’s breath is not imparted to other animals; only humans are formed in God’s image ([Gen 1:27](https://ref.ly/Gen1:27)) and enjoy dialogue with their Creator ([2:16–17](https://ref.ly/Gen2:16-Gen2:17); [3:8–13](https://ref.ly/Gen3:8-Gen3:13)). They alone have spiritual awareness and moral conscience (see [Job 32:8](https://ref.ly/Job32:8)).

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 2:7

## Genesis 2:8 (id: 12417)

Eden was the general location in which the garden was placed, not the garden itself. The term could mean “plain,” “delight,” or “fertility.” The description that follows favors the idea of fertility. • in the east: The exact location of Eden is left to speculation, but it was east of Canaan, Israel’s later home. • God placed the man in the garden for divine fellowship and physical blessing (see also [2:15](https://ref.ly/Gen2:15) and study note there).

## Genesis 2:8–14 (id: 12416)

Analogous to the sacred time marked out on the seventh day of creation ([2:2–3](https://ref.ly/Gen2:2-Gen2:3)), the sacred space of the garden in Eden was separate from the surrounding world. It functioned as a garden\-temple or sanctuary because the Lord manifested his presence there in a special way.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 2:8–GEN 2:14

## Genesis 2:9 (id: 12418)

Beauty and bounty characterized humanity’s original environment (cp. [13:10](https://ref.ly/Gen13:10)). • The tree of life represented God’s presence and provision. The one who ate of it would have everlasting life ([3:22](https://ref.ly/Gen3:22)), which made it a rich image for later Israelite and Christian reflection ([Prov 3:18](https://ref.ly/Prov3:18); [11:30](https://ref.ly/Prov11:30); [13:12](https://ref.ly/Prov13:12); [Rev 2:7](https://ref.ly/Rev2:7); [22:2](https://ref.ly/Rev22:2), [14](https://ref.ly/Rev22:14), [19](https://ref.ly/Rev22:19)). The candlestick in Israel’s Tabernacle may have been a stylized representation of it ([Exod 25:31–35](https://ref.ly/Exod25:31-Exod25:35)). • Eating the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil enabled humanity’s capacity for wisdom ([Gen 3:6](https://ref.ly/Gen3:6)) and moral discernment ([3:5](https://ref.ly/Gen3:5), [22](https://ref.ly/Gen3:22); cp. [Deut 1:39](https://ref.ly/Deut1:39), “innocent”). Eating from it represented a human grasp for autonomy and wisdom that were God’s alone (cp. [Prov 30:1–4](https://ref.ly/Prov30:1-Prov30:4)). Humans sidestepped God’s revelation as the means of moral discernment, flaunting their independence rather than submitting to God’s will (cp. [Prov 1:7](https://ref.ly/Prov1:7)). Choosing human wisdom over God’s instruction brings death and destruction (see [Ps 19:7–9](https://ref.ly/Ps19:7-Ps19:9); [Ezek 28:6](https://ref.ly/Ezek28:6), [15–17](https://ref.ly/Ezek28:15-Ezek28:17)).

## Genesis 2:10 (id: 12397)

The river that was watering the garden was a material blessing (bringing agricultural fertility) and a symbol of God’s presence (cp. [Ps 46:4](https://ref.ly/Ps46:4); [Ezek 47:1–12](https://ref.ly/Ezek47:1-Ezek47:12); [Zech 14:8](https://ref.ly/Zech14:8); [Rev 22:1–2](https://ref.ly/Rev22:1-Rev22:2)). • dividing into four branches (literally *heads*): The common understanding is that one river had its source in Eden, flowed down through the garden, and then split into the four rivers named.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 2:10

## Genesis 2:10–14 (id: 12396)

This detailed description portrays the eastern region around Eden as a mountain with rivers flowing out to the world. Eden’s beauty and fertility enriched the whole earth.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 2:10–GEN 2:14

## Genesis 2:11 (id: 12398)

The Pishon and the Gihon ([2:13](https://ref.ly/Gen2:13)) cannot be identified with certainty. If the land of Havilah was in southeast Arabia or on the African coast, as some biblical data suggest (see [10:7](https://ref.ly/Gen10:7); [25:18](https://ref.ly/Gen25:18); [1 Sam 15:7](https://ref.ly/1Sam15:7)), then the Pishon was possibly the Nile River. Josephus thought that Havilah and the Pishon were in India (*Antiquities* 1\.1\.3\). Two other proposals suggest: (1\) rivers in the mountains of eastern Turkey where the Tigris and Euphrates ([Gen 2:14](https://ref.ly/Gen2:14)) also flow, and (2\) the marshy delta near the Persian Gulf. Current geographical conditions make any theory impossible to prove conclusively.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 2:11

## Genesis 2:12 (id: 12399)

The magnificence and fertility of the garden are pictured as spreading to the surrounding regions through the rivers flowing out from it. The four rivers possibly imply that the garden’s bounty flowed out to the four corners of the earth. • Gold and onyx were later used for decorating the Tabernacle, the Temple ([Exod 25:3–9](https://ref.ly/Exod25:3-Exod25:9); [1 Chr 29:2](https://ref.ly/1Chr29:2)), and the priests’ clothing ([Exod 28:9–14](https://ref.ly/Exod28:9-Exod28:14), [20](https://ref.ly/Exod28:20)). • Resin was used in sacred incense ([Exod 30:34](https://ref.ly/Exod30:34)).

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 2:12

## Genesis 2:13 (id: 12400)

Gihon: Though unknown, proposals have included the Nile (as in the Greek version of [Jer 2:18](https://ref.ly/Jer2:18); Josephus, *Antiquities* 1\.1\.3\), the Jordan, or, according to Jewish tradition, a river that formerly ran through the Kidron Valley ([1 Kgs 1:33](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:33); [2 Chr 33:14](https://ref.ly/2Chr33:14)). • Although Cush is the name of ancient Ethiopia, Mesopotamian regions associated with Babylon seem to be the immediate setting (see [10:8](https://ref.ly/Gen10:8)); Cush is possibly the land of the Kassites, a dynasty ruling in Babylonia.

## Genesis 3:1 (id: 12598)

Genesis describes the deceiver as a serpent, one of the animals God created (see also [3:14](https://ref.ly/Gen3:14) and study note). He is later identified as Satan, the great enemy of God’s people ([Rev 12:9](https://ref.ly/Rev12:9); [20:2](https://ref.ly/Rev20:2)). His manipulative language and his disguise as a serpent, the shrewdest of all creatures, show him as a master deceiver. Satan has various methods for opposing God’s people (see [1 Chr 21:1](https://ref.ly/1Chr21:1); [Zech 3:1–2](https://ref.ly/Zech3:1-Zech3:2)); deception remains among his key strategies (cp. [2 Cor 11:3](https://ref.ly/2Cor11:3), [14](https://ref.ly/2Cor11:14)). The Hebrew term for shrewd (‘arum) can be positive (“prudent,” [Prov 14:8](https://ref.ly/Prov14:8)) or negative (as here; see [Job 5:12](https://ref.ly/Job5:12)). It forms a wordplay with “naked” (‘arummim) in [Gen 2:25](https://ref.ly/Gen2:25). Adam and Eve were naked and vulnerable; the serpent was shrewd and cunning. • Probably the serpent asked the woman because the prohibition was given to Adam prior to Eve’s creation (see [2:16–17](https://ref.ly/Gen2:16-Gen2:17)). Adam was probably aware of the serpent’s cunning, having assessed and named all the animals before Eve was created ([2:19–20](https://ref.ly/Gen2:19-Gen2:20), [23](https://ref.ly/Gen2:23)). • Did God really say? The deceiver began by twisting God’s language to cast doubt on God’s goodness. God’s original prohibition applied to only one tree ([2:16–17](https://ref.ly/Gen2:16-Gen2:17)), not to all (any) of them.

You won’t die! This is the exact negation of God’s clear and emphatic words: “you are sure to die” ([2:17](https://ref.ly/Gen2:17)). The serpent capitalizes on the woman’s uncertainty by baldly denying the penalty and quickly diverting her attention to the supposed prize—to be like God, knowing both good and evil. The deceiver falsely implies that this would be an unqualified good for them. The term rendered God is Elohim; it can also mean “divine beings” (i.e., God and the angels; e.g., [Pss 29:1](https://ref.ly/Ps29:1); [89:7](https://ref.ly/Ps89:7)).

The ancient Near Eastern concept of corporate solidarity (e.g., “you and your descendants,” [Gen 28:14](https://ref.ly/Gen28:14)) is also behind this description of the ongoing hostility that would exist between humans and snakes. The pattern is set using singular terms (He . . . you).

God highlighted his original command not to eat the fruit by speaking of eating several times in [3:17–19](https://ref.ly/Gen3:17-Gen3:19).

Adam’s naming of Eve in such close proximity to [3:16](https://ref.ly/Gen3:16) may suggest that the narrator views it as Adam’s first act of ruling over the woman after the Fall (see study note on 2:19–20).

These back\-to\-back genealogies do more than list names for the record. They contrast the ways that human culture spread, some in rebellion against God (Cain, [4:17–24](https://ref.ly/Gen4:17-Gen4:24)) and some in obedience to God (Seth, [4:25–5:32](https://ref.ly/Gen4:25-Gen5:32)). In Genesis, the history of the rejected branch is generally explained before carrying forward the line that led to Israel. Two points of contrast are especially worth noting: (1\) Lamech, the seventh from Adam through the lineage of Cain, is the main focus of the first genealogy. Like his ancestor, Lamech took human life and had to live in constant fear of death as a consequence ([4:23–24](https://ref.ly/Gen4:23-Gen4:24)). By contrast, Enoch, the seventh from Adam through the lineage of Seth (see [4:25–5:32](https://ref.ly/Gen4:25-Gen5:32)), lived in a way that pleased God and avoided death altogether ([5:24](https://ref.ly/Gen5:24)). (2\) Advances in human culture and technology came through Cain’s line (the first city, livestock, shelter, metallurgy, music), but the effects of sin still dominated. No technological advances are mentioned in Seth’s line; instead, people began “to worship the Lord” ([4:26](https://ref.ly/Gen4:26)) and to find “favor with the Lord” (see [6:8](https://ref.ly/Gen6:8)).

Lamech’s chilling taunt shows the further escalation of sin’s effects on humanity. Cain’s line had reached a crescendo of violence with Lamech’s contempt for life. In his arrogance, he put his deed into poetic verse. • punished seventy\-seven times! God warned that anyone who tried to kill Cain would experience the full weight of justice ([4:15](https://ref.ly/Gen4:15)). Lamech’s declaration that anyone who harmed him would receive an even more severe penalty is a claim to be accountable to no one, including God.

Enosh means “humankind.” In the Old Testament, the term is often used in poetic texts that emphasize human mortality, frailty, and weakness (e.g., [Ps 144:3](https://ref.ly/Ps144:3), “mere mortals”). Enosh was born at the time when people began to worship the Lord by name (literally *call on the name of the* Lord). In Genesis, that meant calling on the name of the Lord through sacrifice and prayer (similar Hebrew terminology is found in [Gen 12:8](https://ref.ly/Gen12:8); [13:4](https://ref.ly/Gen13:4); [21:33](https://ref.ly/Gen21:33); [26:25](https://ref.ly/Gen26:25)).

## Genesis 5:1–32 (id: 12919)

The genealogies of Genesis go beyond simply recording history. By selective information and by structure, they communicate spiritual truth. The genealogies highlight God’s blessing, authenticate the family heritage of important individuals, and hold the Genesis narrative together by showing familial continuity. Adam’s genealogy through Seth traces ten generations to Noah (see [1 Chr 1:1–4](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:1-1Chr1:4); [Luke 3:36–38](https://ref.ly/Luke3:36-Luke3:38)), with the flood intervening before another ten generations from Noah to Abram. The number ten indicates completeness (ten plagues, [Exod 7:8–11:10](https://ref.ly/Exod7:8-Exod11:10); Ten Commandments, [Exod 20:2–17](https://ref.ly/Exod20:2-Exod20:17)).

As with Enoch ([5:21–24](https://ref.ly/Gen5:21-Gen5:24)), the normal genealogical formula is interrupted to highlight important theological information about Noah. Noah sounds like Hebrew nakham*,* “relief” or “comfort,” and nuakh*,* “rest.” As the first person born after Adam’s death (see study note on 5:5), Noah prompted his father Lamech to hope that the curse brought on by Adam’s sin ([3:17](https://ref.ly/Gen3:17)) might be lifted. See [8:21](https://ref.ly/Gen8:21); [2 Cor 1:3–7](https://ref.ly/2Cor1:3-2Cor1:7); [2 Thes 2:16–17](https://ref.ly/2Thess2:16-2Thess2:17).

## Genesis 6:1–2 (id: 12941)

The sons of God have generally been understood as fallen angels (cp. the same Hebrew phrase in [Job 1:6](https://ref.ly/Job1:6); [2:1](https://ref.ly/Job2:1); [38:7](https://ref.ly/Job38:7); [Pss 29:1](https://ref.ly/Ps29:1); [89:7](https://ref.ly/Ps89:7)). This interpretation is prominent in ancient Jewish and Christian literature (e.g., *1 Enoch* 6:1–7:6; Justin Martyr, *Apology* 2\.5\) and is apparently supported by the New Testament (see [1 Pet 3:18–20](https://ref.ly/1Pet3:18-1Pet3:20); [2 Pet 2:4](https://ref.ly/2Pet2:4); [Jude 1:6–7](https://ref.ly/Jude1:6-Jude1:7)). Some interpreters do not believe that God would permit angels to procreate with humans and doubt that the above New Testament texts should be read in this way. Another possibility is that *sons of God* refers to the righteous descendants of Seth, while the beautiful women were female descendants of Cain’s wicked line. This interpretation is in harmony with [Gen 4:17–5:32](https://ref.ly/Gen4:17-Gen5:32) but is weakened by the language of [6:1–2](https://ref.ly/Gen6:1-Gen6:2), which seems to refer to the daughters of humanity in general, not the daughters of Cain specifically. Others believe that *sons of God* refers to tyrannical human kings (possibly demon\-possessed) who took Lamech’s polygamy ([4:19](https://ref.ly/Gen4:19)) to a new height of wickedness by seizing the daughters of the righteous. Language reminiscent of [3:6](https://ref.ly/Gen3:6) (saw . . . took) shows the rebellious nature of this act.

Human wickedness reached a climax, prompting God to send the flood to destroy all living things. A glimmer of hope appears in God’s favor toward Noah ([6:8](https://ref.ly/Gen6:8)).

## Genesis 6:3 (id: 12950)

will not put up with: Many think that this is an announcement of God’s decision to withdraw the restraining influence of his Spirit from human society and allow human wickedness to run its full course. Others think it means that God would withdraw his life\-giving breath from humans at an earlier age (ruakh, the Hebrew term for “spirit,” can also mean “breath”; see [6:17](https://ref.ly/Gen6:17); [7:22](https://ref.ly/Gen7:22); see also [Ps 104:29–30](https://ref.ly/Ps104:29-Ps104:30)). • normal lifespan will be no more than 120 years (literally *his days will be 120 years*): It is possible that this was a new restriction on the number of years individuals would generally be allowed to live (so the NLT). However, for generations after the flood, humans lived well beyond 120 years (see, e.g., [Gen 11:10–26](https://ref.ly/Gen11:10-Gen11:26)). An alternative interpretation sees this as a 120\-year grace period before the arrival of the flood (see [Jon 3:4](https://ref.ly/Jonah3:4); [Matt 24:37–38](https://ref.ly/Matt24:37-Matt24:38); [1 Pet 3:20](https://ref.ly/1Pet3:20); [2 Pet 2:5](https://ref.ly/2Pet2:5)).

giant Nephilites (Hebrew nepilim): The term may mean “fallen ones.” The context implies that they were the offspring of the “sons of God” and would be destroyed in the flood.

The *raven* is the biggest bird in the crow family and in Noah's time the raven was considered ceremonially unclean ([Leviticus 11:15](https://ref.ly/Lev11:15); [Deuteronomy 14:14](https://ref.ly/Deut14:14)). As a scavenger that eats dead animals, it could survive without returning to the boat.

This first mention of an altar in the Bible shows Noah’s gratitude for having passed through the judgment. • sacrificed as burnt offerings: The same wording is used of the whole burnt offering in Leviticus ([Lev 1:3–9](https://ref.ly/Lev1:3-Lev1:9)); however, it can refer to any offering that is burned.

pleased with the aroma of the sacrifice (literally *smelled the sweet aroma*): The narrator uses anthropomorphic language (i.e., he describes God’s activity in human terms) to show God’s acceptance of Noah’s offering (see also [Exod 29:18](https://ref.ly/Exod29:18); [Lev 1:9](https://ref.ly/Lev1:9); [Num 15:3](https://ref.ly/Num15:3)). The common ancient Near Eastern notion that the gods ate the sacrifices offered to them is notably absent. • to himself (literally *in his heart*): The phrase echoes “broke his heart” ([6:6](https://ref.ly/Gen6:6)), just as think or imagine echoes “everything they thought or imagined” ([6:5](https://ref.ly/Gen6:5)). God’s commitment to a new order replaced his grief over the old. • I will never again curse . . . destroy: The old curse was not lifted ([5:29](https://ref.ly/Gen5:29)), but God promised not to add to it, thus establishing new limits for life in a disordered world (cp. [Isa 54:9](https://ref.ly/Isa54:9)). The flood was to stop violence, not to reform the human heart ([Gen 6:5](https://ref.ly/Gen6:5)).

There are two modifications to the original created order. (1\) Previously, humans reigned over the animals ([1:28](https://ref.ly/Gen1:28)), but now animals would live in terror of humans (similar military language is found in [Exod 23:27–31](https://ref.ly/Exod23:27-Exod23:31); [Deut 11:25](https://ref.ly/Deut11:25); [31:8](https://ref.ly/Deut31:8)).

A key restriction is imposed.

The law of Moses prohibited eating animals that died naturally, since their blood had not been drained ([Deut 14:21](https://ref.ly/Deut14:21)). God provided animal blood to atone for human sin ([Lev 17:11](https://ref.ly/Lev17:11); [Heb 9:22](https://ref.ly/Heb9:22)).

Violence, including murder, was a major factor in bringing about God’s judgment of the flood ([4:8](https://ref.ly/Gen4:8); [6:11](https://ref.ly/Gen6:11), [13](https://ref.ly/Gen6:13)). At this new beginning for humans, God affirmed the sanctity of human life and established a system of retributive justice for the taking of human life (see also [Ps 9:12](https://ref.ly/Ps9:12); “Retribution” Theme Note). The function of law is to restrain human wickedness and preserve moral order. This law was further developed in the law of Moses ([Exod 21:12–14](https://ref.ly/Exod21:12-Exod21:14); [Lev 24:17–22](https://ref.ly/Lev24:17-Lev24:22); [Num 35:16–34](https://ref.ly/Num35:16-Num35:34); [Deut 17:6–7](https://ref.ly/Deut17:6-Deut17:7); [19:15](https://ref.ly/Deut19:15)).

For God made human beings in his own image: The death penalty has a theological basis. God’s image gives humans a unique status and authority within creation ([1:26–28](https://ref.ly/Gen1:26-Gen1:28)). Since murder destroys a person made in God’s image, the ultimate penalty must be imposed on a murderer. See also [Exod 21:23–25](https://ref.ly/Exod21:23-Exod21:25). We are not to pursue personal revenge ([Rom 12:17–19](https://ref.ly/Rom12:17-Rom12:19)) but are to uphold the justice of the “governing authorities” that God has established ([Rom 13:1–7](https://ref.ly/Rom13:1-Rom13:7)).

Ham is the father of Canaan: See also [9:20–27](https://ref.ly/Gen9:20-Gen9:27); [10:6–20](https://ref.ly/Gen10:6-Gen10:20). The text emphasizes Canaan’s ancestral connection to Ham to show that the Canaanite identity was inseparably linked to Ham’s shameful behavior ([9:20–27](https://ref.ly/Gen9:20-Gen9:27)). The citizens of both Egypt (from which Israel escaped slavery) and Canaan (to which Israel was headed) were Ham’s descendants ([10:6](https://ref.ly/Gen10:6); see [Lev 18:3](https://ref.ly/Lev18:3), [24–26](https://ref.ly/Lev18:24-Lev18:26); [Pss 105:23](https://ref.ly/Ps105:23), [27](https://ref.ly/Ps105:27); [106:22](https://ref.ly/Ps106:22)).

The Table of Nations precedes the Babel story even though the Babel incident caused the geopolitical situation reflected in the Table of Nations. By reversing the order, Genesis links the repopulation of the earth with the blessing conferred upon Noah and his sons (see [9:1](https://ref.ly/Gen9:1) and study note) and shows that Abram’s call ([12:1–3](https://ref.ly/Gen12:1-Gen12:3)) was God’s solution to the problem of human estrangement from God as reflected in the Babel story ([11:1–9](https://ref.ly/Gen11:1-Gen11:9)).

They were known for shipping (cp. [Ezek 27:8](https://ref.ly/Ezek27:8)). • The Zemarites inhabited Sumur (modern Sumra), north of Arka on the Phoenician coast. • The Hamathites founded what is now Hama on the Orontes River, the northern boundary of Canaan (see [Num 34:8](https://ref.ly/Num34:8); [Josh 13:5](https://ref.ly/Josh13:5); [2 Sam 8:9–10](https://ref.ly/2Sam8:9-2Sam8:10); [1 Kgs 8:65](https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:65); [2 Kgs 14:25–28](https://ref.ly/2Kgs14:25-2Kgs14:28)).

## Genesis 11:1–9 (id: 12267)

The story of the unfinished tower carries forward themes of language and solidarity from the Table of Nations (ch [10](https://ref.ly/Gen10:1-Gen10:32)). The builders’ desire for autonomy recalls the rebellion in Eden (ch [3](https://ref.ly/Gen3:1-Gen3:24)) and establishes the need for Abram’s redemptive faith in the midst of international disorder (ch [12](https://ref.ly/Gen12:1-Gen12:20)). The scattering of the nations anticipates the warning to Israel that idolatry would result in their being scattered and their cities devastated (see [Lev 26:33](https://ref.ly/Lev26:33); [Num 10:35](https://ref.ly/Num10:35); [Deut 4:27](https://ref.ly/Deut4:27); [28:64](https://ref.ly/Deut28:64); [30:3](https://ref.ly/Deut30:3)).

Far from the original garden ([2:15](https://ref.ly/Gen2:15)), the first cities of Genesis represent arrogance ([4:17](https://ref.ly/Gen4:17)), tyranny ([10:8–12](https://ref.ly/Gen10:8-Gen10:12)), and wickedness ([18:20–21](https://ref.ly/Gen18:20-Gen18:21)). The city on the Babylonian plain was a magnet for human pride and idolatry. • a tower that reaches into the sky: This was probably a temple\-tower (a ziggurat). Common in ancient Babylonian urban culture, ziggurats were regarded as sacred mountains by which deities descended to earth (Jacob’s dream in [28:12](https://ref.ly/Gen28:12) possibly reflects this idea). • This will make us famous (literally *let us make a name for ourselves*): The tower builders sought fame through idolatrous ambition.

Babel: The Babylonians viewed their city as the residence or gateway of the gods. The pun that concludes this account accurately reveals Babylon’s spiritual confusion.

This account of Shem’s family resumes the line of Shem from [10:21–32](https://ref.ly/Gen10:21-Gen10:32), now with special focus on the line leading to Abram. Only Abram and Israel are heirs to Shem’s God (see [9:26–27](https://ref.ly/Gen9:26-Gen9:27); [Deut 32:8–9](https://ref.ly/Deut32:8-Deut32:9)). The Babel story vividly repudiates the culture that Abram was called to abandon ([Gen 12:1](https://ref.ly/Gen12:1); [24:6–7](https://ref.ly/Gen24:6-Gen24:7)). Together with the account of Terah’s descendants ([11:27–32](https://ref.ly/Gen11:27-Gen11:32)), this second account of Shem’s line forms a bridge from the universal history of chs [1–11](https://ref.ly/Gen1:1-Gen11:32) to the national history of Israel that begins in ch [12](https://ref.ly/Gen12:1-Gen12:20).

The family had moved there perhaps generations before the call. Their ancestral home (“native country,” [Gen 12:1](https://ref.ly/Gen12:1)) was apparently near Haran, in the region of the descendants of Shem ([11:10–26](https://ref.ly/Gen11:10-Gen11:26)); thus they settled there when they left Ur ([11:31](https://ref.ly/Gen11:31)) and were later described as “Arameans” ([Deut 26:5](https://ref.ly/Deut26:5)). • land of his birth: The same Hebrew phrase is repeated in [12:1](https://ref.ly/Gen12:1) (“native country”), making Ur, not Haran, the location of Abram’s call (see [15:7](https://ref.ly/Gen15:7); [Neh 9:7](https://ref.ly/Neh9:7); [Acts 7:2](https://ref.ly/Acts7:2)).

Sarai means “princess” in Hebrew. No mention is made of Sarai’s parentage, perhaps to add suspense to the Abimelech story, which reveals that she was Abram’s half sister ([20:9–12](https://ref.ly/Gen20:9-Gen20:12)). Later, the law prohibited such a marriage ([Lev 18:9](https://ref.ly/Lev18:9); [20:17](https://ref.ly/Lev20:17); [Deut 27:22](https://ref.ly/Deut27:22)). • Nahor’s wife was Milcah: Milcah was Haran’s daughter and Nahor’s niece (see [Gen 11:29](https://ref.ly/Gen11:29)). Her son Bethuel was the father of Rebekah, the wife of Abram’s son Isaac ([24:10](https://ref.ly/Gen24:10), [15](https://ref.ly/Gen24:15), [24](https://ref.ly/Gen24:24)). The name Milcah is related to the Hebrew word meaning “queen.” In Akkadian, it is a title of the goddess Ishtar, the moon\-god’s daughter. Terah’s name is related to the word for “moon” in Hebrew; his whole family appears to have worshiped Sin, the moon\-god (see [Josh 24:14](https://ref.ly/Josh24:14)).

Sarai’s situation in particular highlights the paradox between the apparent reality and God’s promise to give many descendants ([12:2](https://ref.ly/Gen12:2)). The Israelite nation’s origin from barren women fixes its identity in the sovereignty of God, who miraculously gives children to barren women (see also [1 Sam 1:2](https://ref.ly/1Sam1:2); [2:5](https://ref.ly/1Sam2:5); [Ps 113:9](https://ref.ly/Ps113:9); [Isa 54:1](https://ref.ly/Isa54:1)).

Terah took: The text is clear that Abram’s departure from Ur was prompted by God’s calling (see study note on 11:28), but the event is described from Terah’s perspective, in keeping with the patriarchy of ancient Near Eastern culture. This cultural deference to the oldest male is evidently why Abram did not continue on to Canaan by himself at this time (see [Acts 7:2–4](https://ref.ly/Acts7:2-Acts7:4)). • Haran was 550 miles northwest of Ur, near the Syrian\-Turkish border. Despite the similar name, there is no connection with Terah’s son Haran, who had died in Ur ([11:28](https://ref.ly/Gen11:28)). •*Haran* means “caravan.” Ancient commercial routes converged there, making it a key site for trade. •*Haran* was also well known for the moon worship to which Terah’s family was apparently devoted (see study note on 11:29).

Abram’s obedience to God’s call corresponded to God’s commands (see study note on 12:1–3). He journeyed to Canaan ([12:4–6](https://ref.ly/Gen12:4-Gen12:6)) and became a blessing ([12:5–9](https://ref.ly/Gen12:5-Gen12:9)).

The oak of Moreh was apparently a Canaanite shrine; fertile groves of trees were sacred to the Canaanites (cp. [Isa 1:29](https://ref.ly/Isa1:29)), and *Moreh* means “teacher.” Abram proclaimed (Luther: “preached”) the Lord’s name beside a pagan place of worship and instruction ([Gen 12:8](https://ref.ly/Gen12:8)). • Abram continued to be a blessing when he built an altar to worship God at Shechem and east of Bethel ([12:8](https://ref.ly/Gen12:8)).

## Genesis 12:10–13 (id: 12288)

Abram’s scheme was rooted in fear that jeopardized his family and God’s promises. Abram was not walking by faith when he went to Egypt. He stopped building altars and his deceptiveness took center stage. Deception would plague his family throughout Genesis ([26:1–11](https://ref.ly/Gen26:1-Gen26:11); [27:1–29](https://ref.ly/Gen27:1-Gen27:29); [29:15–30](https://ref.ly/Gen29:15-Gen29:30); [30:34–36](https://ref.ly/Gen30:34-Gen30:36); [31:6–11](https://ref.ly/Gen31:6-Gen31:11); [37:18–35](https://ref.ly/Gen37:18-Gen37:35); [39:7–20](https://ref.ly/Gen39:7-Gen39:20)). • Abram’s plan was probably based on a social custom whereby a brother arranged the marriage of his sister (cp. [24:29–61](https://ref.ly/Gen24:29-Gen24:61)). Abram may have thought that any potential suitor would have to deal with him, giving him time to leave with Sarai. He did not count on Pharaoh’s acting without negotiation ([12:14–16](https://ref.ly/Gen12:14-Gen12:16)).

## Genesis 12:10–20 (id: 12289)

This episode shows that God would not allow Abram to jeopardize his promises. Just after Abram’s obedience to the call, a famine tested his weak faith. God delivered him and his family, even though Abram foolishly used deception rather than trusting in God to preserve him in Egypt. • This story deliberately parallels Israel’s later bondage in Egypt. Because of a famine ([Gen 12:10](https://ref.ly/Gen12:10) *//* [Gen 47:13](https://ref.ly/Gen47:13)), Abram/Israel went to Egypt ([Gen 12:10](https://ref.ly/Gen12:10) *//* [Gen 47:27](https://ref.ly/Gen47:27)); there was an attempt to kill the males and save the females ([Gen 12:12](https://ref.ly/Gen12:12) *//* [Exod 1:22](https://ref.ly/Exod1:22)); God plagued Egypt ([Gen 12:17](https://ref.ly/Gen12:17) *//* [Exod 7:14–11:10](https://ref.ly/Exod7:14-Exod11:10)); Abram/Israel plundered Egypt ([Gen 12:16](https://ref.ly/Gen12:16) *//* [Exod 12:35–36](https://ref.ly/Exod12:35-Exod12:36)); they were expelled (Hebrew shalakh, “send”; [Gen 12:19–20](https://ref.ly/Gen12:19-Gen12:20) *//* [Exod 12:31–33](https://ref.ly/Exod12:31-Exod12:33)) and ascended to the Negev ([Gen 13:1](https://ref.ly/Gen13:1) *//* [Num 13:17](https://ref.ly/Num13:17), [22](https://ref.ly/Num13:22)).

Abram was bound by the king’s gift to an unwanted agreement about Sarai that he could not prevent.

Abram and Lot had to separate (ch [13](https://ref.ly/Gen13:1-Gen13:18)), and Hagar, an Egyptian maiden, became the mother of the Ishmaelites, perennial enemies of Israel (ch [16](https://ref.ly/Gen16:1-Gen16:16)).

The holy God made (literally *cut*) a unilateral covenant with Abram; its promises were absolutely sure because they did not depend on what Abram or his descendants might do.

## Genesis 15:18–19 (id: 12341)

God specified the boundaries of the Promised Land. His clear message to Abram was that despite prospects of death and suffering (enslavement), he and his descendants would eventually receive the promises, for God had sworn an oath (see [Heb 6:13–14](https://ref.ly/Heb6:13-Heb6:14)). Nothing can separate God’s people from his love or the fulfillment of his plans (see [Rom 8:18–39](https://ref.ly/Rom8:18-Rom8:39); [2 Pet 1:3–4](https://ref.ly/2Pet1:3-2Pet1:4)).

Abram and Sarai faced the tension of her being barren and beyond childbearing years. By custom, a barren woman could give her servant to her husband as a slave\-wife; the child born to that union was considered the wife’s child and could be adopted as the heir. Sarai’s suggestion, unobjectionable by custom, set a problematic human plan in motion. God’s promises would be fulfilled by faith.

The angel’s rhetorical questions encouraged Hagar to pour out her heart to God. When she did, God commanded her to return and submit ([16:9](https://ref.ly/Gen16:9)), promising that her son would have innumerable descendants. The angel of the Lord never referred to Hagar as Abram’s wife, only as Sarai’s servant. She would have Abram’s child, but Ishmael was not central to God’s covenant with Abram.

Hagar’s son would become the father of a great but wild and hostile nation living in the Arabian Desert as perennial enemies of Israel (cp. [25:18](https://ref.ly/Gen25:18)).

Names in Genesis often capture the message of a passage and aid the remembrance of the events and their significance in the history of the faith. The name Ishmael, which means “God hears,” commemorates that the Lord . . . heard Hagar’s cry of distress (see also study note on 16:14–15). This name would have greatly comforted Hagar; God listened to her prayers and acknowledged her complaint.

The names Beer\-lahai\-roi, which means “well of the Living One who sees me,” and Ishmael (see [16:11](https://ref.ly/Gen16:11)) were a message and a rebuke for Abram and Sarai. God sees affliction and hears the cries of those in need. Sarai and Abram should have prayed rather than taking the fulfillment of the promise into their own hands by following social custom (cp. [25:21](https://ref.ly/Gen25:21)). Giving children to the barren woman is God’s work ([Ps 113:9](https://ref.ly/Ps113:9); cp. [1 Sam 1:1–28](https://ref.ly/1Sam1:1-1Sam1:28); [Luke 1:1–25](https://ref.ly/Luke1:1-Luke1:25)); impossible difficulties cannot be resolved by human intervention.

God guaranteed his promise by changing Abram’s name. Abram referred to his noble lineage, as Terah was the “exalted father” ([11:27](https://ref.ly/Gen11:27)). His new name, Abraham (Hebrew ’ab hamon) was a wordplay on the promise of his own progeny (see also [John 8:31–59](https://ref.ly/John8:31-John8:59); [Rom 4:16–17](https://ref.ly/Rom4:16-Rom4:17); [Gal 3:7](https://ref.ly/Gal3:7), [15–19](https://ref.ly/Gal3:15-Gal3:19), [29](https://ref.ly/Gal3:29)).

Abraham’s peaceful and generous reception of the visitors contrasts sharply with the chaos and corruption of Sodom (ch [19](https://ref.ly/Gen19:1-Gen19:38)). Eating together was important in making or confirming covenants; when God was ready to fulfill the covenant promise, he came in person to share a meal with Abraham. Fellowship with God has always been signified by a communal meal (see [Exod 24:9–11](https://ref.ly/Exod24:9-Exod24:11); [Matt 26:17–30](https://ref.ly/Matt26:17-Matt26:30) *//* [Luke 22:7–38](https://ref.ly/Luke22:7-Luke22:38); [Acts 2:42](https://ref.ly/Acts2:42); [1 Cor 11:20–34](https://ref.ly/1Cor11:20-1Cor11:34)).

Abraham probably thought there were more righteous people in Sodom and Gomorrah than there were (see study note on 19:14). In his concern for them, he approached the Lord with a legal appeal based on God’s justice. His prayer seems too bold at times, as though he were bargaining with God, but he approached God with genuine humility and reverence. He did not try to talk God into doing something against his will, but prayed for the well\-being of others (contrast Lot’s prayer, [19:18–23](https://ref.ly/Gen19:18-Gen19:23)). God is a righteous judge; righteousness exalts a nation ([Prov 14:34](https://ref.ly/Prov14:34)), and righteous people help to preserve society (cp. [Matt 5:13](https://ref.ly/Matt5:13)).

The two angels also first appeared to Abraham as men ([18:2](https://ref.ly/Gen18:2)). • Lot was no longer living in tents next to Sodom ([13:12](https://ref.ly/Gen13:12))—he had become a citizen and leader in Sodom, sitting there at the entrance of the city. Community leaders (elders) usually congregated in the gates, where legal and business transactions were publicly finalized (cp.

As a righteous man ([2 Pet 2:7–8](https://ref.ly/2Pet2:7-2Pet2:8)), Lot tried to modify the townspeople’s wickedness by giving advice on good living (cp. [Gen 19:9](https://ref.ly/Gen19:9)). Although he denounced gross evil, Lot preferred Sodom’s sumptuous lifestyle to life in the hills (cp. [13:10–11](https://ref.ly/Gen13:10-Gen13:11)), where there was clean living but no “good life.” As long as the Lord left Lot and his family alone in Sodom, he lived comfortably there and kept his personal belief in God; but finally, he could not hold to both. Sodom would have destroyed Lot if the Lord had not destroyed Sodom. • This account showed Israel that God is the righteous judge of the whole earth ([18:25](https://ref.ly/Gen18:25)) who will judge evildoers with justice and equity.

The character of Lot’s daughters was formed by Sodom’s culture more than by their father’s heritage, so they had no qualms about having children by their drunk father (cp. [9:21–22](https://ref.ly/Gen9:21-Gen9:22)). They saw no other way to carry on their line.

The daughters’ plan worked, and they each became pregnant by their own father. From these two incest\-born sons came two perennial enemies of Israel, the nations of Moab and Ammon.

## Genesis 20:1–18 (id: 12419)

This second “sister story” in Genesis (cp. [12:10–20](https://ref.ly/Gen12:10-Gen12:20)) occurred shortly before Sarah became pregnant with Isaac (ch [21](https://ref.ly/Gen21:1-Gen21:34)). On both occasions, God protected Abraham and Sarah’s marriage in purity for the sake of the covenant promises. Participation in God’s plan requires separation from worldly corruption. • This story took place in the Promised Land; it showed Israel how God intervened in people’s lives to fulfill his plan, how God continued to protect them against threats from other tribes, and how God used his chosen people to mediate his relationship with the nations. • God’s preventing the destruction of Abraham’s marriage by adultery reminded the Israelites to keep their marriages morally and racially pure ([Ezra 9:1–4](https://ref.ly/Ezra9:1-Ezra9:4); [Neh 13:23–27](https://ref.ly/Neh13:23-Neh13:27); [Mal 2:10–17](https://ref.ly/Mal2:10-Mal2:17)); they should not allow any opportunity for temptation ([Exod 20:14](https://ref.ly/Exod20:14), [17](https://ref.ly/Exod20:17); [Lev 20:10](https://ref.ly/Lev20:10); [21:13–15](https://ref.ly/Lev21:13-Lev21:15)).

Abimelech was innocent ([20:6](https://ref.ly/Gen20:6)); his conscience was clear. Nonetheless, he was about to commit adultery, and ignorance does not excuse guilt ([Lev 4:13–14](https://ref.ly/Lev4:13-Lev4:14)). • will you destroy an innocent nation? Abimelech’s appeal to God echoes Abraham’s earlier words (cp. [18:23–32](https://ref.ly/Gen18:23-Gen18:32)) and rebukes Abraham’s lack of faith on this occasion.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 20:4–GEN 20:5

## Genesis 20:6 (id: 12428)

Because Abimelech acted with a clear conscience, God kept him from sinning. God will graciously help those who try to do what is right.

Abraham's prayer saved the king's life and restored his family ([20:17–18](https://ref.ly/Gen20:17-Gen20:18)). Abimelech learned that Abraham's God was sovereign (meaning God has complete power and authority over everything). Abraham, as God's prophet, received God's messages and would pray for others (see [Numbers 12:13](https://ref.ly/Num12:13); [Deuteronomy 9:20](https://ref.ly/Deut9:20)).

Abraham had earned rebukes from Abimelech and from God (cp. [12:17–19](https://ref.ly/Gen12:17-Gen12:19)). Abimelech was angry that Abraham’s deception had made him guilty of this great sin (see study note on 20:3–7). He knew that taking a married woman into his harem was wrong.

Sarah’s wordplay on the name *Isaac* (Hebrew yitskhaq, “he laughs”) shows that the laughter of unbelief when the promise was given ([18:12](https://ref.ly/Gen18:12)) had changed to the laughter of joy at its fulfillment. Isaac’s name could refer to the pleasure of God and of his parents at his birth. Sarah knew that everyone who heard about this would laugh with her and rejoice at the news.

The feast for Isaac’s weaning probably occurred when he was three and Ishmael was about seventeen years old ([16:16](https://ref.ly/Gen16:16)). Sarah saw Ishmael making fun of her son, Isaac: The verb metsakheq (“making fun of”) is related to the word for “laughter”; this theme ([21:6](https://ref.ly/Gen21:6)) is given a sour twist by Ishmael’s mockery.

God again rescued Hagar in the wilderness and guaranteed her future (cp. [16:7–14](https://ref.ly/Gen16:7-Gen16:14)). This passage is similar to ch [16](https://ref.ly/Gen16:1-Gen16:16), but the differences are great. Here, Hagar and Ishmael are rescued, but there is no commemorative naming. God’s earlier promise to Hagar is reiterated, but this time Hagar is not told to return to Sarah. The repeated motifs on the two occasions confirm God’s sovereign plan for Hagar and Ishmael. As Joseph later told Pharaoh, a twofold event demonstrated God’s confirmation ([41:32](https://ref.ly/Gen41:32)). God did not abandon Hagar and Ishmael but met them in their despair (cp. [16:7](https://ref.ly/Gen16:7)), provided sustenance for them, and promised again that Ishmael would found a great nation ([21:13](https://ref.ly/Gen21:13); cp. [16:11–12](https://ref.ly/Gen16:11-Gen16:12)).

## Genesis 22:1 (id: 12457)

Some time later: Abraham had sent Ishmael away and settled in the land. Now God tested Abraham’s faith by telling him to give up Isaac. This pushed the limits of logic and of Abraham’s knowledge of God. Would he still obey when God seemed to be working against him and against the covenant? Would he cling to the boy or surrender him to God (see [Exod 13:11–13](https://ref.ly/Exod13:11-Exod13:13))?

Obedience to God’s earlier call ([12:1–3](https://ref.ly/Gen12:1-Gen12:3)) was rewarded with great blessing; now Abraham had the opportunity to show even greater obedience. • Take your son . . . Isaac, whom you love so much: By this detailed description of Isaac, God reminded Abraham that the young man was his beloved son, and intensified his awareness of the cost of the sacrifice. • The name Moriah is explained by the Chronicler ([2 Chr 3:1](https://ref.ly/2Chr3:1)) as the place of the later Temple Mount in Jerusalem. • Go: By wording the command in this way, God helped Abraham to obey by recalling his former call (cp.

We will worship there, and then we will come (or *We will worship there so that we may come back*): Abraham’s amazing statement makes us wonder what he was thinking. Abraham knew that God had planned the future of the covenant around Isaac and that God wanted him to sacrifice Isaac. He could not reconcile these things in his mind; he could only do what God commanded him to do, and leave the future to God (cp. [Heb 11:17–19](https://ref.ly/Heb11:17-Heb11:19)).

God’s intervention was dramatic and instructive, confirming that he never intended for Isaac to be sacrificed.

God wanted Abraham to sacrifice his own will and surrender it to God, and when he did, God intervened. This passage sets a pattern for all sacrificial worshipers. Like Abraham, true worshipers of God know that everything belongs to God—it all came from God and must therefore be acknowledged as God’s possession. A true worshiper holds nothing back but obediently gives God what he asks, trusting that God will provide for all needs, and then discovering through experience that God always does so.

Now God knew that Abraham would hold nothing back from him, that he did truly fear God. To fear the Lord means to reverence him as sovereign, trust him implicitly, and obey him without protest.

God provided a ram caught by its horns in a thicket for the sacrifice. God graciously allowed Abraham to substitute an animal sacrifice in place of Isaac.

As with many patriarchal narratives, the heart of the matter is retained through commemorative naming. Yahweh\-Yireh . . . means “the Lord will provide” (see [22:8](https://ref.ly/Gen22:8)). That Abraham used the holy name in this act shows that the patriarchs knew the name Yahweh (cp. [Exod 6:2–3](https://ref.ly/Exod6:2-Exod6:3)) but not its full meaning (see study note on Exod 6:2–3). • To this day: Later Israelites understood this passage as a lesson about their own worship in Jerusalem. Abraham’s sacrifice took place on the mountain of the Lord, later the location of the Temple in Jerusalem (see study note on 22:2). Three times a year, the people of Israel brought their best to God as a sacrifice, trusting that he would continue to provide for their needs.

This transaction was the first sign that a permanent transition had taken place, as people were normally buried in their ancestral homeland (cp. [49:29–50:13](https://ref.ly/Gen49:29-Gen50:13)). In burying Sarah, Abraham detached from his just\-mentioned ancestral home (where his relatives still lived, [22:20–24](https://ref.ly/Gen22:20-Gen22:24)); his future would be in Canaan, where his descendants would realize the promise.

## Genesis 23:3–4 (id: 12473)

Abraham bargained with local Hittite elders for a piece of land for a burial site. These Hittites had apparently migrated south to Canaan from the great Hittite empire in eastern Asia Minor (modern Turkey; cp. [10:15](https://ref.ly/Gen10:15)). • Abraham was a stranger and a foreigner among these people; his hope was in God’s promise that he would eventually possess the land.

## Genesis 23:5–6 (id: 12474)

my lord, you are an honored prince: Either Abraham was highly regarded by these people, or they were politely appealing to his generosity. • Choose the finest. . . . No one here will refuse: They were willing to accommodate his request, especially if they could legally obligate him to themselves ([23:11](https://ref.ly/Gen23:11)).

## Genesis 23:9 (id: 12476)

This would be a permanent burial place for Abraham’s family. The site was near Mamre ([23:19](https://ref.ly/Gen23:19)), where Abraham lived (see [13:18](https://ref.ly/Gen13:18); [14:13](https://ref.ly/Gen14:13); [18:1](https://ref.ly/Gen18:1)). Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, and Jacob and Leah would all be buried in this cave ([23:19](https://ref.ly/Gen23:19); [25:9](https://ref.ly/Gen25:9); [35:27–29](https://ref.ly/Gen35:27-Gen35:29); [49:29–31](https://ref.ly/Gen49:29-Gen49:31); [50:13](https://ref.ly/Gen50:13)), their permanent place in the Promised Land.

## Genesis 23:11 (id: 12469)

Ephron did not intend to give the cave to Abraham; Abraham was expected to “give” the full price in return. Ephron wanted to sell as much as he could to avoid responsibility for caring for the cave and to receive as high a price as possible.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 23:15

## Genesis 23:16–20 (id: 12472)

Abraham paid the amount and finalized the transaction, avoiding indebtedness by accepting no gifts from the people (cp. [14:21–24](https://ref.ly/Gen14:21-Gen14:24)). The Hittite elders witnessed the transaction, ensuring that no one could challenge Abraham’s full ownership of the land. The transaction took place at the city gate, where public legal and business dealings were conducted (cp. [19:1](https://ref.ly/Gen19:1)). The land became Abraham’s permanent possession, a down payment on God’s promise to give him the land. Abraham knew that God’s promise was not fulfilled ([12:7](https://ref.ly/Gen12:7)) by this acquisition, so he planned for the future. By buying land for his dead, he declared that God’s promises do not end with this life. This is the hope of all who die in faith.

## Genesis 24:1–9 (id: 12478)

Confident in the Lord’s promise, Abraham had his chief servant (probably Eliezer, [15:2](https://ref.ly/Gen15:2)) swear to find a wife among Abraham’s relatives in his homeland, some 450 miles away. Abraham was faithful to the covenant by preparing for Isaac’s future.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 24:1–GEN 24:9

## Genesis 24:1–67 (id: 12477)

Isaac’s marriage to Rebekah ensured that God’s plan would continue into the next generation. God showed covenant faithfulness by working through his faithful people ([24:12](https://ref.ly/Gen24:12), [27](https://ref.ly/Gen24:27), [49](https://ref.ly/Gen24:49)).

## Genesis 24:3 (id: 12492)

Isaac knew how wicked and threatening the local Canaanite people were, so he maintained separation from them (cp. [26:34–35](https://ref.ly/Gen26:34-Gen26:35); [27:46](https://ref.ly/Gen27:46); [28:8–9](https://ref.ly/Gen28:8-Gen28:9)).

Aram\-naharaim (“Aram of the two rivers”) was also called *Paddan\-aram* (“the field of Aram,” cp. [25:20](https://ref.ly/Gen25:20)). It was a two\-week journey in each direction, so the servant had ten . . . camels for provisions and gifts ([24:22](https://ref.ly/Gen24:22), [53](https://ref.ly/Gen24:53)).

The servant faithfully carried out the mission, and he glorified God in displaying faithful covenant love for Abraham’s family by bringing all the details together. God sovereignly worked behind the scenes to accomplish his will through the circumstances of those acting responsibly in faith.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 24:10–GEN 24:60

## Genesis 24:14 (id: 12482)

Abraham’s future daughter\-in\-law manifested hospitality and industry like Abraham’s (see [18:1–8](https://ref.ly/Gen18:1-Gen18:8)). Ten thirsty camels could drink 250 gallons of water, so a woman who would work that hard for a stranger was certainly not lazy, but generous and hospitable.

The servant was not diverted from his mission; he insisted on telling his story before he would eat. He recounted his mission and acknowledged God’s providence in directing him to Rebekah before attending to his personal needs. The servant wanted everyone to know that this was God’s work, not a chance or humanly arranged meeting.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 24:33–GEN 24:48

## Genesis 24:48 (id: 12493)

The way that God directed this event from behind the scenes is different than in most of Genesis, but it is true to how the life of faith normally works. Faith, expressed in personal prayer and obedience, looks for evidence of God’s working. Believers usually have to make wise choices and remain faithful to the covenant, trusting that God will guide them through the circumstances of life to accomplish his will.

## Genesis 24:57–58 (id: 12497)

Rebekah’s decision to leave immediately to be with her new husband settled the impasse. Rebekah submitted to the Lord’s obvious leading. Young women were normally eager to marry (not to marry was a catastrophe), and later accounts of Laban suggest why Rebekah preferred to leave (cp. [31:14–15](https://ref.ly/Gen31:14-Gen31:15)). Rebekah displayed faithful love to the servant, Abraham’s family, and Isaac by going to be Isaac’s wife.

The name Jacob (Hebrew ya‘aqob, from Hebrew ‘aqeb, “heel, footprint”) was originally positive, meaning “protect” (like a rear guard), but it took on the negative meaning of “heel grabber” or “deceiver” in the context of Jacob’s deceptive, grasping, usurping character (see [27:36](https://ref.ly/Gen27:36)).

## Genesis 25:27–34 (id: 12518)

Jacob and Esau each developed in accord with his initial characteristics ([25:24–26](https://ref.ly/Gen25:24-Gen25:26)). Esau, the reddish, hairy man, cared about physical things rather than spiritual things (see [Heb 12:16](https://ref.ly/Heb12:16)); he was finally overcome by physical appetites and sold his birthright. Jacob, the heel grabber, knew the birthright’s value and drove a ruthless bargain to gain it presumptuously from his brother.

Ironically, Jacob proved the more cunning hunter. The word cooking (Hebrew wayyazed, “boiling”) sounds like the word for “hunter” (Hebrew tsayid). While boiling stew, Jacob was laying a trap for the hairy red animal. He may have waited a long time for this opportunity. This word for “boil” was also used for presumptuous action (like water boiling over the rim of the pot). Jacob overstepped his boundaries when he seized the promise for himself. By contrast, Abraham knew the promise was his and was secure in giving the land away (see study note on 13:8–13). • Esau was exhausted and hungry, but his life was not in danger ([25:32](https://ref.ly/Gen25:32); see study note on 25:33–34).

Jacob was the better hunter on this occasion, but great danger lay in exercising such strong ambition. God’s people should desire the things of God, but they must not seek them in the flesh (see [Zech 4:6](https://ref.ly/Zech4:6); [Gal 5:16–17](https://ref.ly/Gal5:16-Gal5:17); [Eph 6:10–12](https://ref.ly/Eph6:10-Eph6:12)). The Lord dealt severely with Jacob to purge him of carnal methods.

Esau eagerly took Jacob’s bait and fell into the trap. He ate and left too quickly to have been near death ([25:32](https://ref.ly/Gen25:32)). The final comment on the passage explains that Esau showed contempt for his birthright, considering it worthless ([Heb 12:16](https://ref.ly/Heb12:16)).

The Lord assured Isaac that the covenant promises (cp.

These terms were later used in Deuteronomy to describe God’s full legal covenant with Israel. An Israelite reader would immediately think of the complete Torah when hearing these words and be prompted to obey God’s law as Abraham did, though Abraham had only a few commands from the Lord. Through these words, the text emphasizes that Abraham would have obeyed the later commands if he had had them, because he was an obedient servant of the Lord.

## Genesis 26:6–11 (id: 12539)

While staying in Gerar, Isaac, like his father, deceived people into believing that his wife was his sister. Some suppose that this story duplicates the stories of Abraham’s deception ([12:10–20](https://ref.ly/Gen12:10-Gen12:20); [20:1–18](https://ref.ly/Gen20:1-Gen20:18)), but the differences are greater than the similarities, and the son’s repetition of his father’s lie is natural. Through numerous parallels with Abraham, ch [26](https://ref.ly/Gen26:1-Gen26:35) shows how God’s plan continued with Isaac. Even when Isaac jeopardized the covenant as his father had, God prevented disaster and preserved the marriage. Abraham’s descendants would be blessed because of Abraham, but they had to exercise their own faith to enjoy the blessings. Genuine faith in God’s promises engenders a fearless walk with him; cowering in fear endangers the blessing and mocks the faith.

## Genesis 26:8 (id: 12540)

Abimelech . . . saw Isaac caressing Rebekah: The word for “caressing” (Hebrew metsakheq) is the same as the word used for Ishmael’s “making fun of” Isaac ([21:9](https://ref.ly/Gen21:9)); the word is related to the name “Isaac” (Hebrew yitskhaq). It is as though Isaac’s lapse of faith made fun of Abimelech and made a mockery of Rebekah and the great promise embodied in Isaac’s name.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 26:8

## Genesis 26:10–11 (id: 12529)

Isaac, like his father, was rebuked by Abimelech (see study note on 20:1–18). This legal wording would remind Israel of how important it was to preserve marital purity. Abimelech recognized the danger to his own people. Though his decree preserved his own society, it was also a word from God that preserved the sanctity of Isaac’s and Israel’s marriages. If Isaac’s marriage had ended here, there would have been no Israelite society.

Isaac lived in the land as a temporary settler, enjoying abundant prosperity because of God’s blessing; his crops flourished and he became very rich.

## Genesis 26:14–16 (id: 12531)

The Philistines envied Isaac’s prosperity and filled his wells with dirt. The king then ordered Isaac to leave that region because he was too powerful for them (cp. [21:22–23](https://ref.ly/Gen21:22-Gen21:23)).

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 26:14–GEN 26:16

## Genesis 26:17–22 (id: 12532)

Isaac moved . . . to the Gerar Valley (away from the city of Gerar itself, [26:6](https://ref.ly/Gen26:6), but probably still within ten miles) and reopened his father’s wells. Isaac was also opposed there, but chose not to fight back; he relinquished one well after another until God’s blessing outdid the opposition. Whenever Isaac reopened a well, and regardless of how often enemies caused them to cave in, he found water. God was blessing Isaac and that blessing could not be hindered. Finally, the Philistines left Isaac alone.

At Beersheba, . . . the Lord appeared to Isaac to confirm his covenant (cp. [21:31–33](https://ref.ly/Gen21:31-Gen21:33)). Isaac responded in faith as his father had done by building an altar to the Lord and proclaiming the Lord’s identity and nature (see study note on 12:8; [21:33](https://ref.ly/Gen21:33)).

This treaty is similar to the one an earlier king had made with Abraham (cp. [21:22–31](https://ref.ly/Gen21:22-Gen21:31)). This king acknowledged that God was blessing Isaac and realized that a treaty with Isaac would benefit him. No opposition can hinder God’s blessing—it will flourish, and other nations will see it and seek peace with God’s people to share in the blessing.

## Genesis 26:34–35 (id: 12538)

Esau’s marriages illustrate how unfit he was to lead the covenant people into God’s blessings, and how foolish was Isaac’s later attempt to bless Esau ([27:1–40](https://ref.ly/Gen27:1-Gen27:40)). Esau later married a third wife in a vain attempt to do the right thing ([28:6–9](https://ref.ly/Gen28:6-Gen28:9)).

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 26:34–GEN 26:35

The first scene sets up the chapter’s crisis. Isaac knew of God’s oracle ([25:22–23](https://ref.ly/Gen25:22-Gen25:23)), yet he thwarted or ignored it by trying to bless Esau. • Isaac was old and turning blind: He was losing his senses, both physically and spiritually.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 27:1–GEN 27:4

## Genesis 27:1–40 (id: 12541)

Jacob got his father Isaac’s blessing through deception. In this story, an entire family tries to carry out their responsibilities by physical means rather than by faith. Faith would have provided Rebekah and Jacob a more honorable solution to the crisis.

Rebekah and Jacob got the blessing but reaped hatred from Esau and separation from one another; there is no indication that Rebekah and Jacob ever saw each other again.

Jacob met the Lord on a road that Abraham had traveled 125 years earlier. The story in [27:42–33:17](https://ref.ly/Gen27:42-Gen33:17) follows a pattern (called a "chiasm") focusing on Jacob’s exile: 

* A: Jacob runs away from Esau ([27:42–28:9](https://ref.ly/Gen27:42-Gen28:9))

    + B: Angels of God meet Jacob at Bethel ([28:10–22](https://ref.ly/Gen28:10-Gen28:22))

    - C: Jacob lives in exile in Paddan\-aram ([29:1–31:55](https://ref.ly/Gen29:1-Gen31:55))

Isaac remained in the land, but Jacob had to leave it. God would deal with Jacob under the hand of Laban, his uncle (see study note on 29:1–31:55). • Believers in any age must remain spiritually pure by marrying other believers ([2 Cor 6:14–18](https://ref.ly/2Cor6:14-2Cor6:18)). The Canaanite people incorporated dozens of groups and clans into their society and religion by wars, treaties, and marriages (see [Gen 34:20–23](https://ref.ly/Gen34:20-Gen34:23)). Abraham’s family was to resist such mixing (cp. [24:3](https://ref.ly/Gen24:3); ch [34](https://ref.ly/Gen34:1-Gen34:31)); they were to marry within their clan to maintain the purity of the line and of the faith that identified them as the chosen seed. The surest way to lose their distinctiveness was to intermarry with people of other tribal backgrounds and beliefs (see [Ezra 9–10](https://ref.ly/Ezra9:1-Ezra10:44); [Neh 13:23–29](https://ref.ly/Neh13:23-Neh13:29)).

Before Jacob departed, Isaac gave him a pure, legitimate blessing. He did not hold back, because he now knew what God wanted him to do. Isaac clearly passed on the blessing God Almighty (Hebrew El\-Shaddai; see [17:1](https://ref.ly/Gen17:1)) had given to Abraham and to him regarding prosperity and the land (cp. [15:5](https://ref.ly/Gen15:5), [18–20](https://ref.ly/Gen15:18-Gen15:20)).

Despite Jacob’s previous means of securing the blessing, God assured him of protection and provision. The God of Abraham and Isaac was also the God of Jacob. The revelation dramatically changed Jacob’s outlook and brought faith into clearer focus.

stairway (traditionally *ladder*): This word occurs nowhere else in Scripture. The imagery probably reminded readers of a staircase or ramp up the front of a ziggurat that signified communication between heaven and earth (see study note on 11:4). God initiated a divine communication between heaven and earth to guide and protect Jacob, the steward of his covenant ([28:13–15](https://ref.ly/Gen28:13-Gen28:15); see [Ps 91:11–15](https://ref.ly/Ps91:11-Ps91:15)). • Jesus said that he himself is the stairway between heaven and earth ([John 1:51](https://ref.ly/John1:51)).

## Genesis 28:12–15 (id: 12563)

The point of the vision was that God and his angels were with Jacob on his journey. God reiterated to Jacob the covenant promises made to Abraham and Isaac, promising him land, descendants numerous as the dust (cp. [13:16](https://ref.ly/Gen13:16); [22:17](https://ref.ly/Gen22:17)), and universal blessing through him (cp.

Jacob inherited Abraham’s entire covenant (see [22:17](https://ref.ly/Gen22:17)), which confirmed Isaac’s blessing ([28:3–4](https://ref.ly/Gen28:3-Gen28:4)) and stipulated a temporary exile ([28:15](https://ref.ly/Gen28:15); see [15:12–16](https://ref.ly/Gen15:12-Gen15:16)).

I am with you: The promise of God’s presence meant that God would protect and provide for Jacob in a special way. God’s promise to be with his people is repeated throughout Scripture (see also [26:24](https://ref.ly/Gen26:24)), prompting a response of worship and confidence in those who have faith ([28:16–22](https://ref.ly/Gen28:16-Gen28:22)).

## Genesis 28:16–22 (id: 12566)

The second half of the passage gives Jacob’s response to the revelation. He felt reverential fear and awe in the Lord’s presence, and his acts of devotion became archetypes of Israel’s worship. When God graciously visits his people and promises to be with them and make them a blessing to the world, his people respond in faith with reverential fear, worship, offerings, and vows. They preserve their faith in memory for future worshipers.

## Genesis 29:1 (id: 12579)

Jacob hurried on: The Hebrew text says that he “picked up his feet” as if he felt the wind at his back; he continued his journey with fresh enthusiasm. His changed outlook was the direct result of the vision he received at Bethel, a marvelous revelation that God was going to protect and bless him. He now sought the fulfillment of God’s promises to him, not just an escape from Esau. Jacob’s attitude had become positive and magnanimous to the point of being naive and vulnerable.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 29:1

## Genesis 29:1–31.55 (id: 12573)

These chapters tell how God kept his promise by abundantly blessing Jacob with family and possessions. God also disciplined Jacob, leaving him to struggle with Laban for many years. Laban was Jacob’s match in deception, and thus a means of correction. • The story of Jacob and Laban parallels Israel’s later sojourn in Egypt. Jacob struggled while serving his uncle but finally emerged with a large family (the founders of the twelve tribes) and great wealth. In Egypt, the Israelites suffered under their oppressors, but they also flourished, becoming a great nation of twelve large tribes and escaping with great riches.

Jacob’s meeting Rachel at the well was providentially timed by the sovereign God who was leading Jacob to fulfillment of the promises (cp. [24:12–20](https://ref.ly/Gen24:12-Gen24:20)).

In contrast to the lazy, unhelpful shepherds ([29:7–8](https://ref.ly/Gen29:7-Gen29:8)), Jacob is portrayed as generous, industrious, and energetic. • Jacob . . . watered his uncle’s flock: Laban’s flocks would flourish under Jacob’s care.

## Genesis 29:14–30 (id: 12576)

Jacob’s joyful prospect of marriage to the lovely Rachel became an occasion for Laban’s shrewdness and Jacob’s discipline. Jacob and his mother had deceived his father and brother to gain the blessing; now his mother’s brother deceived him. Jacob received a dose of his own duplicity through twenty years of labor, affliction, and deception in Laban’s service ([31:38](https://ref.ly/Gen31:38)). In God’s justice, people harvest what they plant ([Gal 6:7](https://ref.ly/Gal6:7)). Laban’s deception was perfectly designed to make Jacob aware of his own craftiness. God often brings people into the lives of believers to discipline them. But Jacob was tenacious, and God blessed him abundantly with a large family and many possessions ([30:25–43](https://ref.ly/Gen30:25-Gen30:43)) during this time of service.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 29:14–GEN 29:30

Seven years of service was a high bride\-price in the ancient world, but Rachel was beautiful (like Sarah and Rebekah), and Jacob was in love with her.

## Genesis 29:23–26 (id: 12581)

Like Isaac, Jacob was plied with food and wine (cp. [27:25](https://ref.ly/Gen27:25)), deprived of sight in the darkness (cp. [27:1](https://ref.ly/Gen27:1)), baffled by clothing (cp. [27:15](https://ref.ly/Gen27:15)), and misled by touch (cp. [27:23](https://ref.ly/Gen27:23)). The marriage had been consummated ([29:23](https://ref.ly/Gen29:23); see [2:24](https://ref.ly/Gen2:24)), so Jacob was bound to Leah. • It’s not our custom here to marry off a younger daughter ahead of the firstborn: Laban’s words are a reminder of what Jacob did when he, the younger son, pretended to be his older brother to gain the blessing (ch [27](https://ref.ly/Gen27:1-Gen27:46)). Now Leah, the older sister, pretended to be the younger sister to get a husband. God gave the deceiver a dose of his own deception as a discipline in his life.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 29:23–GEN 29:26

## Genesis 29:28–30 (id: 12582)

After the bridal week ended ([29:27](https://ref.ly/Gen29:27)), Jacob also received Rachel as his wife, though he then would have to work an additional seven years (cp. [31:41](https://ref.ly/Gen31:41)). Laban seemed to have gained the upper hand.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 29:28–GEN 29:30

## Genesis 29:30 (id: 12583)

Jacob loved Rachel much more than Leah: Favoritism was an ongoing cause of dysfunction in Jacob’s family (cp. [25:28](https://ref.ly/Gen25:28); [37:3](https://ref.ly/Gen37:3)). Jacob’s favoritism had lasting effects: his family was never together, and their descendants, the tribes of Israel, were rarely unified.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 29:30

## Genesis 29:31–35 (id: 12585)

Leah’s first four sons were born in rapid succession, but Rachel could not conceive. She was barren, like Sarah and Rebekah (cp.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 29:31–GEN 29:35

## Genesis 29:31–30.24 (id: 12584)

The rivalry between these sisters explains much of the later rivalry among their sons, and then among the tribes, just as the rivalry between Jacob and Laban foreshadowed conflict between Israel and the Arameans of Damascus ([2 Sam 8:5–6](https://ref.ly/2Sam8:5-2Sam8:6); [10:8–19](https://ref.ly/2Sam10:8-2Sam10:19); [1 Kgs 20:1–34](https://ref.ly/1Kgs20:1-1Kgs20:34); [2 Kgs 5:1–8:29](https://ref.ly/2Kgs5:1-2Kgs8:29); [13:1–25](https://ref.ly/2Kgs13:1-2Kgs13:25); [Isa 7:1–9](https://ref.ly/Isa7:1-Isa7:9)). • God champions the cause of the poor and oppressed; he exalted Leah, the despised first wife, as the first to become a mother. Judah’s kingly tribe and Levi’s priestly line came through her despite Jacob’s favoritism for Rachel and her children. Despite the tension and jealousy resulting from Laban’s treachery and Jacob’s favoritism, God still built Jacob’s family and brought about the births of the tribal ancestors.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 29:31–GEN 30:24

## Genesis 29:32 (id: 12586)

Reuben (Hebrew re’uben) sounds like the Hebrew for “He has seen my misery” (ra‘ah be‘onyi). His birth gave Leah consolation from God and hope for Jacob’s love. Jacob seems not to have seen her misery, but God did (cp. [16:14](https://ref.ly/Gen16:14); [24:62](https://ref.ly/Gen24:62); [25:11](https://ref.ly/Gen25:11)). The name was a reminder of God’s intervention.

## Genesis 29:33 (id: 12587)

Leah named her second son Simeon. The name suggests that she had cried out to the Lord and was heard (cp. [16:11](https://ref.ly/Gen16:11)).

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 29:33

Leah named her third son Levi, hoping that her husband would become “attached” to her since she had given him three sons. This hope was not fulfilled.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 29:34

## Genesis 29:35 (id: 12589)

Leah reconciled herself to the reality that nothing would turn Jacob’s affections toward her. She named her fourth son Judah with the sentiment, “I will praise the Lord.” She seems to have given up on Jacob, taking her consolation from the Lord.

## Genesis 30:1–2 (id: 12611)

In that culture, it was like death for a woman not to have children (cp. [1 Sam 1](https://ref.ly/1Sam1:1-1Sam1:28)); only God could open Rachel’s womb.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 30:1–GEN 30:2

## Genesis 30:1–8 (id: 12612)

Rachel’s naming of sons through Bilhah does not reflect faith as Leah’s namings had. Rachel felt wronged over the marriage and her barrenness. The names of Bilhah’s sons reflect Rachel’s bitter struggle with her sister and her feeling of some victory.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 30:1–GEN 30:8

## Genesis 30:3–4 (id: 12621)

Rachel’s decision to have children through her servant, and Jacob’s compliance, recall Sarai’s use of Hagar ([16:1–4](https://ref.ly/Gen16:1-Gen16:4)).

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 30:3–GEN 30:4

## Genesis 30:9 (id: 12631)

When Leah saw that she had stopped bearing children, she countered Rachel’s effort by giving her servant . . . to Jacob as a wife even though she already had four sons.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 30:9

## Genesis 30:10–13 (id: 12613)

*Gad* (meaning "fortune") was the name of a god associated with fortune. *Asher* (meaning "happy") was the name of a god associated with luck. These names show Leah's pagan background, but there is no indication she believed in these gods.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 30:10–GEN 30:13

## Genesis 30:14–17 (id: 12614)

People believed *mandrakes* could increase sexual desire and help women become pregnant (see [Song 7:13](https://ref.ly/Song7:13)). Rachel hoped they would help her become pregnant, so she made a deal with Leah. Rachel would let Leah spend one night with Jacob in exchange for mandrakes. Yet, Leah became pregnant, not Rachel.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 30:14–GEN 30:17

## Genesis 30:18 (id: 12615)

The name Issachar captures the sense of Jacob’s being hired ([30:16](https://ref.ly/Gen30:16)) and of the Lord’s rewarding Leah (Hebrew sekari, “my hire”).

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 30:18

## Genesis 30:19–20 (id: 12616)

Zebulun means “honor” or “gift,” as in a dowry or tribute. Leah thought that God gave her Zebulun so that her husband would honor her. This hope never fully left her.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 30:21

## Genesis 30:22–24 (id: 12618)

Rachel finally gave birth to her own son, Joseph. His birth was brought about by God’s intervention, not by superstitious practices ([30:14–16](https://ref.ly/Gen30:14-Gen30:16)) or the social custom of giving servants as wives. • Removed (Hebrew ’asap, “take away”) sounds similar to Joseph (Hebrew yosep, “may he add”). Rachel rejoiced over Joseph’s birth, yet she prayed that the Lord would add yet another son to her family.

## Genesis 30:25–34 (id: 12619)

After his fourteen years of service, Jacob asked Laban for permission to go home. The two bedouin leaders negotiated politely but remained cautiously on guard. Laban wanted to get more out of Jacob. Jacob wanted to gain his wages by selective breeding.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 30:25–GEN 30:34

## Genesis 30:27 (id: 12620)

I have become wealthy: God had prospered Laban through Jacob’s presence (see [22:18](https://ref.ly/Gen22:18)). Laban may have looked for omens, or simply have perceived what was happening. Since dark\-colored sheep ([30:32](https://ref.ly/Gen30:32)) were rare, a large number of them was considered an omen of God’s blessing.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 30:27

## Genesis 30:30–33 (id: 12622)

Jacob agreed that God had blessed Laban through him, so he made a plan to gain something for himself. He proposed for his wages the rare black and multicolored goats and the speckled and spotted sheep that were born.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 30:30–GEN 30:33

## Genesis 30:32 (id: 12623)

As Abraham had done with Lot ([13:9](https://ref.ly/Gen13:9)), Jacob gave Laban what he valued most. White sheep were more common and more valuable than dark or multicolored sheep; as a man of faith, Jacob was willing to take the rejects (cp. [1 Cor 1:26](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:26)).

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 30:32

## Genesis 30:34–36 (id: 12624)

Laban verbally agreed with Jacob’s plan, but he tried to prevent Jacob from accruing wealth by removing animals from the flock that would fulfill the agreement. • Laban’s deception with his goats reminds us of Jacob’s deception of Esau (cp.

*exposing the white inner wood:* This clever wordplay explains the entire section. When Jacob *exposed the white* (Hebrew *laban*) streaks of wood underneath, he played the "white" game (the *Laban* game) and won. By outsmarting Laban ("Whitey"), Jacob's flocks increased and he became successful.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 30:37

## Genesis 30:37–43 (id: 12625)

God blessed Jacob despite Laban’s duplicity. Not to be outwitted, Jacob used selective breeding to acquire a flock, following the traditional belief that peeled sticks influenced the kind of animal that would be born. The peeled branches seemingly made his animals produce streaked and spotted young; Jacob later acknowledged that God had prospered him ([31:7–12](https://ref.ly/Gen31:7-Gen31:12)). Jacob gained stronger animals for himself and weaker ones for Laban ([30:41–42](https://ref.ly/Gen30:41-Gen30:42)).

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 30:37–GEN 30:43

Laban now received due recompense for his treatment of Jacob. Laban’s attempt to defraud Jacob resulted in Jacob’s coming out ahead, because God was at work in his life.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 30:42

## Genesis 30:43 (id: 12628)

Jacob became very wealthy, in fulfillment of God’s promises to him ([27:28](https://ref.ly/Gen27:28); [28:13–15](https://ref.ly/Gen28:13-Gen28:15)).

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 30:43

## Genesis 31:1–2 (id: 12633)

The animosity of Laban’s sons against Jacob grew because his flocks were multiplying faster than Laban’s. They were jealous of God’s blessing on Jacob and afraid that he would completely overrun them.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 31:1–GEN 31:2

## Genesis 31:1–21 (id: 12632)

Jacob’s return journey precipitated a confrontation with Laban that set a permanent boundary between Israel (Jacob) and Aram (Laban). God kept his word to Jacob by prospering him in Paddan\-aram and protecting him on his journey home.

## Genesis 31:3 (id: 12644)

* *the land of your fathers* was Canaan, to which God had called Abraham ([12:1–7](https://ref.ly/Gen12:1-Gen12:7); [17:8](https://ref.ly/Gen17:8)).
* *Go back … I will be with you:* See study notes on 26:2–5; 28:12–15. God protected Jacob (also called “Israel,” [32:28](https://ref.ly/Gen32:28)) as he led his family back to the land God promised them. Later, God brought Israel back to Canaan after many years of slavery in Egypt.

    This return had many similarities to this passage:

    + God defeated foreign gods and beliefs.
        + He used dreams for rescue and protection.
        + He gave victory over threats.
        + He set boundaries between nations and tribes (see [Deuteronomy 32:8](https://ref.ly/Deut32:8)).

## Genesis 31:4–13 (id: 12645)

Jacob explained to his wives how God had blessed him despite Laban’s opposition. He was not sure they would want to leave Laban and go to Canaan. He wanted to take a willing family, so he had to make an effective appeal. He rehearsed God’s leading and provision over the years and then told them that he had to keep the vow he had made at Bethel ([28:20–22](https://ref.ly/Gen28:20-Gen28:22)).

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 31:4–GEN 31:13

## Genesis 31:14–16 (id: 12634)

The women responded immediately that they would go with Jacob because God had blessed him. They were very willing to leave Laban, who had squandered their wealth (the property that would have provided for them). They knew that what God had given to Jacob would also be theirs.

## Genesis 31:19–20 (id: 12636)

Rachel stole her father’s household idols: Rachel probably wanted to regain some of the assets Laban had squandered; possibly she also worshiped idols (cp. [35:2–4](https://ref.ly/Gen35:2-Gen35:4)). To have the idols may have signified claiming the family inheritance, as customs in subsequent periods indicate. Laban apparently felt vulnerable without them. Whatever her reasons, Rachel’s theft almost brought disaster on the fleeing family when Laban caught up with them. • A wordplay shows that Rachel and Jacob were very much alike—Rachel stole (Hebrew wattignob) Laban’s household gods, and Jacob outwitted (Hebrew wayyignob, “stole the heart of, deceived”) Laban.

## Genesis 31:22–23 (id: 12638)

The theft of the idols ([31:19](https://ref.ly/Gen31:19)) was probably the main reason that Laban and his men chased Jacob. It was one thing for Jacob to take his family and flocks—Laban probably still believed they were all his—but another matter entirely to take his household gods. Laban may have feared that Jacob would return someday to claim all of Laban’s estate. When he failed to find the gods, he asked for a treaty to keep Jacob away ([31:43–53](https://ref.ly/Gen31:43-Gen31:53)). • It took Laban seven days to catch up with Jacob.

The God that Isaac feared (see textual note) was with Jacob ([31:3](https://ref.ly/Gen31:3)), had seen his hard work and faithfulness despite Laban’s abuse, and had rewarded Jacob. Laban’s dream only proved to Jacob that he was in the right.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 31:42

## Genesis 31:45–48 (id: 12649)

The stone and the heap of stones were a monument to the border treaty between the two men, as a witness to future generations. Each man named the monument witness pile in his native language. It remained the perpetual border between Israel and the kingdom of Aram (Syria), two nations often at war.

Laban added some face\-saving stipulations to the treaty, using many words to cover up his own untrustworthiness and portray Jacob as the unethical party.

Jacob divided his company into two groups or camps (Hebrew makhanoth, related to “Mahanaim” in [32:2](https://ref.ly/Gen32:2)) because he was afraid, remembering Esau’s character and his threat to kill Jacob (see [25:25](https://ref.ly/Gen25:25); [27:41](https://ref.ly/Gen27:41)).

Jacob’s prayer is a wonderful example of how to address God. He based his appeal on God’s will, reminding God of his relationship with him, his command for him to return to the land, and his promise ([32:9](https://ref.ly/Gen32:9)). He had a correct attitude of genuine humility and total dependence on God ([32:10](https://ref.ly/Gen32:10)). Finally, he asked that God rescue him from his brother, and he repeated God’s promises (see [22:17](https://ref.ly/Gen22:17)).

The Jabbok River flows westward to the Jordan Valley, dividing the region of Bashan on the north from Gilead on the south. Wordplays on Jacob’s name and character preserve the memory of this encounter. Jacob (Hebrew ya‘aqob), while at Jabbok (Hebrew yabboq), wrestled (Hebrew wayye’abeq).

What is your name? The Lord’s question was really about Jacob’s character, not his identity (cp. [3:9](https://ref.ly/Gen3:9); [4:9](https://ref.ly/Gen4:9)). By giving his name, Jacob confessed his nature, his way of doing things as “Heel\-grabber, Deceiver, Usurper.” Before God would bless him, he had to acknowledge who he was, and then God would change his identity.

Jacob knew the importance of the blessing, but he was too self\-sufficient and proud to let the blessing be given to him.

## Genesis 32:30 (id: 12664)

Peniel (which means “face of God”): The name shows that Jacob recognized the man as a manifestation of God (a *theophany*). • yet my life has been spared (or *and I have been rescued*): The saying probably meant that Jacob realized that his prayer to be rescued from Esau ([32:11](https://ref.ly/Gen32:11)) had been answered, for if he could meet God like this and walk away, he had nothing to fear from Esau. The saying may also reflect an ancient understanding that no one could see God and live (see [Exod 33:20](https://ref.ly/Exod33:20)).

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 32:30

## Genesis 32:31 (id: 12665)

God injured Jacob’s hip, thus curtailing his proud self\-sufficiency. Since the Lord had restricted his natural strength, Jacob would have to rely on the Lord with greater faith. He had thought that returning to his land would be a matter of outwitting his brother once again ([32:3–21](https://ref.ly/Gen32:3-Gen32:21)), but here at the land’s threshold he met its true proprietor. He would get the land, but only if God fought for him. Self\-sufficiency—trying to achieve the blessing by our own strength or by the ways of the world—will not suffice. If we persist, God may have to cripple our self\-sufficiency to make us trust him more.

Jacob’s identity had been changed ([32:27–28](https://ref.ly/Gen32:27-Gen32:28)), but he had not yet learned to live up to the new name; he still showed the favoritism that divides families. He lined up his family and his possessions in the order of their importance to him, with the slave wives and their children in front (to face danger first), Leah’s group behind them, and Rachel and Joseph in the back, where it was safest.

## Genesis 33:1–17 (id: 12669)

Jacob’s long\-anticipated meeting with his brother Esau turned out far better than he had feared. Esau’s changed heart is an example of how “God fights” (See [32:28](https://ref.ly/Gen32:28)). Earlier, he had cared little about the birthright ([25:32–34](https://ref.ly/Gen25:32-Gen25:34)); now he cared little for old grudges. Jacob recognized that God had intervened.

this gift I have brought you (literally *my blessing*): Jacob perceived Esau as a threat and tried to appease him with a gift (cp.

## Genesis 34:1–31 (id: 12682)

Once Jacob and his family settled in the land, the Canaanite presence became a threat. This account is a stern warning to the Israelites about the possibility of their being defiled by the Canaanites. The nation of Israel was later commanded not to intermarry or make treaties with them, for they were a corrupt and corrupting people. This chapter implicitly warns against becoming familiar with the way they lived ([34:1–2](https://ref.ly/Gen34:1-Gen34:2)). It also taught Israel that in dealing with the Canaanites, they were to keep their integrity and not use the holy things of the covenant for deception and slaughter ([34:13](https://ref.ly/Gen34:13)); Israel’s reputation was at stake in the land ([34:30](https://ref.ly/Gen34:30)). For their ruthless violence, Simeon and Levi were passed over in the birthright blessing ([49:5–7](https://ref.ly/Gen49:5-Gen49:7)).

While Shechem’s intense feelings for Dinah made him willing to undergo significant hardship ([34:11–12](https://ref.ly/Gen34:11-Gen34:12), [17–18](https://ref.ly/Gen34:17-Gen34:18), [24](https://ref.ly/Gen34:24)), the way he showed his “love” for her was selfish, impetuous, and in violation of customary decency (cp. [Judg 14:2](https://ref.ly/Judg14:2); see [1 Cor 13:4–7](https://ref.ly/1Cor13:4-1Cor13:7); [1 Jn 4:10](https://ref.ly/1John4:10)). His character illustrated why Israel needed to remain separate from the Canaanites.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 34:3–GEN 34:4

## Genesis 34:5–7 (id: 12688)

Jacob’s response to this crime is surprising. When he heard that Dinah had been defiled, he said nothing about it until his sons came home. Because Jacob did not act, his sons did, though without the wisdom and integrity necessary for justice. Dinah’s full brothers were shocked and furious that Shechem had done such a disgraceful thing to Jacob’s family (literally *in Israel;* this is the first use of the name *Israel* to describe the family). This sexual crime was an outrage against the community of God’s people and deserved punishment, but the leader of the clan did nothing.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 34:5–GEN 34:7

## Genesis 34:8–10 (id: 12689)

Hamor proposed an alliance of intermarriage with the prospect of mutual economic benefit, but God had already promised Jacob everything, including the land ([34:10](https://ref.ly/Gen34:10); see [14:21–24](https://ref.ly/Gen14:21-Gen14:24)). Hamor wanted to gain control of Israel’s wealth ([34:23](https://ref.ly/Gen34:23)); no good could come of trusting the defiling Canaanites. For some of these reasons, intermarriage with Canaanites was not allowed under the law (see [Exod 23:27–33](https://ref.ly/Exod23:27-Exod23:33); [Deut 7:1–5](https://ref.ly/Deut7:1-Deut7:5))—unless, of course, they came to faith (see [Josh 2:1–15](https://ref.ly/Josh2:1-Josh2:15); [6:23–25](https://ref.ly/Josh6:23-Josh6:25); [Matt 1:5](https://ref.ly/Matt1:5)).

## Genesis 34:13–17 (id: 12683)

Dinah’s brothers responded to the proposal without waiting for Jacob to respond, and they acted deceitfully. They may not have thought that Shechem and his people would ever agree to the rite of circumcision, but they knew what they would do if the Canaanites accepted ([34:25](https://ref.ly/Gen34:25)).

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 34:13–GEN 34:17

## Genesis 34:18–24 (id: 12684)

The Canaanites accepted the stipulation and every male in the town was circumcised. This was not just to allow Shechem to marry Dinah, but to give them the opportunity to acquire everything that Jacob possessed ([34:23](https://ref.ly/Gen34:23)).

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 34:18–GEN 34:24

## Genesis 34:25–29 (id: 12685)

When Simeon and Levi used circumcision to deceive and slaughter the Canaanites, they showed disdain for the sign of the covenant. Their slaughter of all the males and their plunder of the city was not justice, but brutal and excessive revenge. In their moral outrage and desire to right the wrong, they should have demanded compensation (see [Exod 22:16–17](https://ref.ly/Exod22:16-Exod22:17); [Deut 22:28–29](https://ref.ly/Deut22:28-Deut22:29)).

This chapter highlights God’s promises, Jacob’s vow, and the transition to Jacob’s sons’ carrying on the covenant. Deborah, Rachel, and Isaac all died, marking the end of an era and of the account of Isaac’s family ([25:19–35:29](https://ref.ly/Gen25:19-Gen35:29)). • Idols were removed ([35:1–4](https://ref.ly/Gen35:1-Gen35:4)) and pure worship was established ([35:6–7](https://ref.ly/Gen35:6-Gen35:7)).

Jacob had vowed wholehearted devotion to the Lord ([28:20–22](https://ref.ly/Gen28:20-Gen28:22)); establishing this required that his family remove all pagan idols and cease their devotion to other gods.

The account of Esau stresses two points. First, Esau’s sons were born . . . in the land of Canaan ([36:5](https://ref.ly/Gen36:5)) before he moved to Seir ([36:8](https://ref.ly/Gen36:8)). Jacob’s children, by contrast, were almost all born outside the land but then moved into it. God was giving the land to Jacob and his descendants and so made room for them by providing for Esau in a different place. Second, Esau’s other name was Edom. Israel often struggled with the Edomites (see [1 Sam 21:7](https://ref.ly/1Sam21:7); [22:9–22](https://ref.ly/1Sam22:9-1Sam22:22); [Obad 1](https://ref.ly/Obad1:1-Obad1:21)).

These chiefs descended from Esau, who was a great and powerful overlord. As father of the Edomites, he ruled over clans and regions, with eleven chiefs descended from him.

In ch [36](https://ref.ly/Gen36:1-Gen36:43), Esau was well on his way to power and prosperity; by contrast, Jacob, still waiting for the promise, settled in the land as a foreigner, like his father.

The account of Jacob and his family tells of Joseph and his brothers. Jacob is still prominent, but the focus is on Joseph, who is introduced as an obedient seventeen\-year\-old son. • Joseph reported . . . the bad things his brothers were doing: Bringing a bad report has never been popular, but it was the right thing to do and shows that Joseph was faithful from the beginning. As the story progresses, we see more of his brothers’ wickedness displayed until, like Cain, they tried to eliminate the brother who pleased God.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 37:2

## Genesis 37:2–50.26 (id: 12724)

The story of Joseph and his brothers comprises a separate unit in Genesis, distinct in tone and emphasis from the preceding material. It traces one continuous series of episodes with Joseph at their center. • Cycles of repeated motifs structure the entire Joseph account. The themes are closely related to those found in wisdom books such as Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Daniel. Wisdom literature assures the faithful that God brings good out of evil and joy out of pain—if not in this life, then certainly in the life to come. Though the wicked may prosper for a time, the righteous should hold fast to their integrity because a higher, more enduring principle of life is realized through obedience to God. Everyone who aspires to leadership in God’s plan should observe how wisdom led to Joseph’s success. Christ Jesus embodied the life of wisdom portrayed here as no one else could, for he is the wisdom of God. • Judah is also an important character in the story. He began as irresponsible and mean\-spirited as his brothers; but he truly repented, put his life on the line to ransom a child for his father, and received a very important inheritance.

The brothers’ angry response to the revelation, in contrast to Joseph’s honesty and faithfulness, clearly demonstrates why they were not chosen for leadership: Leaders in God’s plan cannot be consumed with jealousy and hatred. In their anger, they missed an important part of the revelation—they too would be rulers (stars, [37:9](https://ref.ly/Gen37:9)) who would productively bind their sheaves ([37:7](https://ref.ly/Gen37:7)).

His brothers hated Joseph because they were jealous of him. Rather than recognize the hand of God, the brothers tried to prevent the dream from being fulfilled ([37:18–36](https://ref.ly/Gen37:18-Gen37:36)). These actions show that they were not fit to lead the household of faith. God’s sovereign choice of a leader, especially if the one chosen is young or appears unqualified, often brings out the true colors of those who have to submit to that leader’s authority. The brothers represent people throughout history who have been driven by envy and malice because they were not committed to doing the Lord’s will. • Jacob wondered what the dreams meant because he knew that God would choose the next leader, that God could choose the younger son to rule over the older sons, and that God could reveal all this in dreams.

The story of Judah and Tamar is a carefully placed interlude; it reports what was happening in the family of Judah, who would later rise to prominence, and it shows the beginnings of assimilation with the people of the land to help explain why God sent the family to Egypt (chs [39–47](https://ref.ly/Gen39:1-Gen47:31)).

as our law requires. . . . You must produce an heir for your brother: The custom that informs this episode is the law for levirate marriage (Latin levir, “husband’s brother”). By this custom, which was later incorporated into God’s law for Israel ([Deut 25:5–10](https://ref.ly/Deut25:5-Deut25:10)), if a man died childless, his brother or nearest relative would marry his widow to produce a child who would carry on the family name of the deceased and inherit his property. Apparently, the near kinsman had a right to refuse, but he would be disgraced in the family for refusing to perpetuate his brother’s name.

Tamar realized that she would have to take matters into her own hands if the family were to have a future. Tamar acted in keeping with the levirate custom (see study note on 38:8) out of loyalty to her deceased husband. She had a legal right to an heir by Judah’s son or by Judah, so she lured her father\-in\-law into having sex with her. Jacob’s family was deceived again, this time by a Canaanite daughter\-in\-law.

She is more righteous than I am: Judah acknowledged that he had shirked his responsibility to provide an heir. It was sinful for Judah to go to a prostitute, but Tamar had a legal right to be the mother of Judah’s child and had acted on that right. In the book of Ruth, the elders analogously blessed the marriage of Boaz and Ruth, praying that God would make Ruth like Tamar ([Ruth 4:12](https://ref.ly/Ruth4:12); cp.

Judah’s line continued because of Tamar.

Jacob’s gaining the right to rule over his older brother ([27:29](https://ref.ly/Gen27:29)) seemed to be relived in Judah’s line. The line was carried on through Perez and not through the elder son Shelah, whom he had gone to such lengths to protect ([38:11](https://ref.ly/Gen38:11); see [1 Chr 4:21](https://ref.ly/1Chr4:21)), nor through the elder twin Zerah (see [Ruth 4:13–22](https://ref.ly/Ruth4:13-Ruth4:22); [Matt 1:3](https://ref.ly/Matt1:3)).

God . . . sent me is the central message of the account of Jacob’s family ([37:2](https://ref.ly/Gen37:2)). As the Lord had told Abraham, he was leading the Israelites into Egypt ([15:13](https://ref.ly/Gen15:13)). God had sent Joseph to Egypt to prepare for his family’s rescue during the famine. In what has become a classic statement of God’s sovereignty, Joseph explained that God had been working through all of the circumstances and human acts to bring about his plan. The certainty of God’s will is the basis for forgiveness and reconciliation with those who do wrong, cause hurt, or bring harm. If people do not believe that God is sovereign, then they will blame others and retaliate. Those who are spiritual will trust that God is at work even through human wickedness (see also [Rom 8:28–30](https://ref.ly/Rom8:28-Rom8:30)).

The brothers experienced forgiveness from God and from Joseph. Far from commanding his brothers to bow down to him (see [42:6–7](https://ref.ly/Gen42:6-Gen42:7)), Joseph welcomed them. Joseph held no grudge because he accepted what had happened as God’s work and saw the good that had resulted (see [50:14–21](https://ref.ly/Gen50:14-Gen50:21)).

bury me with my ancestors: Cp. [49:29–33](https://ref.ly/Gen49:29-Gen49:33). Jacob wanted to be buried with Abraham and Isaac in the cave of Machpelah (see study note on 49:29–33; see [23:1–20](https://ref.ly/Gen23:1-Gen23:20); [25:7–10](https://ref.ly/Gen25:7-Gen25:10); [35:27–29](https://ref.ly/Gen35:27-Gen35:29)). • Put your hand under my thigh: This custom (cp. [24:1–9](https://ref.ly/Gen24:1-Gen24:9) and study note on 24:2) was a serious oath to carry on the covenant, which had as its main promise innumerable descendants in the Promised Land.

When the oath was taken, Jacob bowed humbly in worship and thanked the Lord for ensuring that he would be buried with his ancestors in the land of promise (cp. [1 Kgs 1:47](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:47)).

## Genesis 48:1–22 (id: 12888)

In blessing Ephraim and Manasseh, Jacob reached out by faith for the promise to be continued, having learned that God’s ways are not always the ways of men. Out of Jacob’s long life, the writer to the Hebrews selected the blessing of Joseph’s sons as his great act of faith ([Heb 11:21](https://ref.ly/Heb11:21)). As Jacob acted in light of God’s will, the primary blessing was again given to the younger instead of the older son, but without scheming and its bitter results.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 48:1–GEN 48:22

## Genesis 48:3–4 (id: 12894)

Jacob rehearsed how God Almighty had appeared to him and had promised him Abraham’s blessing—innumerable descendants dwelling in the land . . . as an everlasting possession (cp. [28:10–22](https://ref.ly/Gen28:10-Gen28:22)).

## Genesis 48:5–7 (id: 12895)

Jacob, prompted by his memory of Rachel (see [35:16–20](https://ref.ly/Gen35:16-Gen35:20)), blessed Joseph by elevating his two sons as coheirs with his other sons—the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh would have shares along with the other tribes that came from Jacob (see [Josh 16–17](https://ref.ly/Josh16:1-Josh17:18)). Jacob also gave Ephraim, Joseph’s younger son, the birthright (see [1 Chr 5:1–2](https://ref.ly/1Chr5:1-1Chr5:2)). As a result of this blessing, Ephraim and Manasseh became large and powerful tribes (see [Josh 17:14–18](https://ref.ly/Josh17:14-Josh17:18)).

## Genesis 48:14 (id: 12890)

The right hand was for the head of the firstborn, and Jacob was deliberately giving that position to the younger son. That pattern was followed for four consecutive generations: Isaac over Ishmael, Jacob over Esau, Joseph over Reuben, and Ephraim over Manasseh. Many years later, Ephraim became the leading tribe in the northern kingdom, superior to the tribe of Manasseh. The entire northern kingdom of Israel was occasionally called Ephraim (see study notes on 2 Chr 28:12; Isa 11:13; Ezek 37:15–28; Hos 6:4; Zech 9:10).

## Genesis 48:15–16 (id: 12891)

In his blessing on Joseph, Jacob used a threefold invocation to describe the God in whom he trusted: (1\) the God who was in covenant with his fathers Abraham and Isaac ([28:13](https://ref.ly/Gen28:13); [31:5](https://ref.ly/Gen31:5), [42](https://ref.ly/Gen31:42); [32:9](https://ref.ly/Gen32:9); [46:3](https://ref.ly/Gen46:3)); (2\) the God who had been his shepherd (cp.

He prayed the same blessings for Joseph’s sons.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 48:15–GEN 48:16

## Genesis 48:17–19 (id: 12892)

Joseph was upset: He expected God to act according to convention, but faith recognizes that God’s ways are not man’s ways, and God’s thoughts are not man’s thoughts. It took Jacob a lifetime to learn this lesson, but he did learn it, and here he acted on it.

## Genesis 48:22 (id: 12893)

Joseph was later buried at Shechem ([Josh 24:32](https://ref.ly/Josh24:32)) as a sign that he possessed this bequeathed extra portion (Hebrew shekem) of land. Jacob had apparently conquered this area though the occasion is not mentioned elsewhere.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 48:22

## Genesis 49:1–2 (id: 12897)

Jacob’s words were deliberately chosen prophetic oracles. The days to come refer to the conquest and settlement of the Promised Land, and beyond that to the messianic age. They would all share in the blessing; all the tribes would enter the land with Joshua, but they would not all participate equally.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 49:1–GEN 49:2

## Genesis 49:1–28 (id: 12896)

Jacob, by faith and as God’s spokesman, looked forward to Israel’s settlement in the land, and beyond that to the glorious future. Here at the end of the patriarchal age, he foretold what would happen to each tribe as he evaluated his sons one by one, just as Noah had done at the end of the primeval era (cp. [9:25–27](https://ref.ly/Gen9:25-Gen9:27)). The character and acts of each ancestor affected the lives of his descendants ([Exod 20:5–6](https://ref.ly/Exod20:5-Exod20:6); [34:6–7](https://ref.ly/Exod34:6-Exod34:7); [Num 14:18](https://ref.ly/Num14:18); [Jer 32:18](https://ref.ly/Jer32:18)).

As firstborn, Reuben was entitled to be head of the family, but because he had the ungoverned impulses of boiling or turbulent waters ([35:22](https://ref.ly/Gen35:22)), Jacob prophesied that Reuben would fail in leadership (see [37:21–22](https://ref.ly/Gen37:21-Gen37:22), [29](https://ref.ly/Gen37:29); [42:22](https://ref.ly/Gen42:22), [37–38](https://ref.ly/Gen42:37-Gen42:38); cp.

Simeon and Levi were violent and lawless; instead of serving justice, they indulged their uncontrolled anger and disregarded life ([34:24–29](https://ref.ly/Gen34:24-Gen34:29)). • I will scatter them: Simeon’s land was largely absorbed into Judah’s ([Josh 19:1](https://ref.ly/Josh19:1), [9](https://ref.ly/Josh19:9)); Levi was given a more honorable future because the Levites became the priestly tribe (see [Exod 32:25–29](https://ref.ly/Exod32:25-Exod32:29)), but they had no region of their own ([Josh 21](https://ref.ly/Josh21:1-Josh21:45)).

## Genesis 49:8–12 (id: 12917)

The blessing on Judah commands the most attention. In this oracle, Jacob predicted the fierce, lion\-like dominance of Judah over his enemies and over his brothers, who would praise him (cp. [29:35](https://ref.ly/Gen29:35); see, e.g., [Ruth 4:11–12](https://ref.ly/Ruth4:11-Ruth4:12); [1 Sam 18:6–7](https://ref.ly/1Sam18:6-1Sam18:7); [Pss 2](https://ref.ly/Ps2:1-Ps2:12), [45](https://ref.ly/Ps45:1-Ps45:17), [72](https://ref.ly/Ps72:1-Ps72:20); [Isa 11:1–13](https://ref.ly/Isa11:1-Isa11:13)).

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 49:8–GEN 49:12

## Genesis 49:10 (id: 12898)

This verse anticipates the kingship in Judah (cp. [17:6](https://ref.ly/Gen17:6), [16](https://ref.ly/Gen17:16); [35:11](https://ref.ly/Gen35:11)). Although the birthright blessing went to Joseph, Judah would provide Israel’s rulers (see [1 Chr 5:1–2](https://ref.ly/1Chr5:1-1Chr5:2)). A long line of kings from Judah would retain the scepter, the symbol of rule; the last king would be the one to whom it belongs, the promised Messiah (see [2 Sam 7:4–16](https://ref.ly/2Sam7:4-2Sam7:16); [Pss 2](https://ref.ly/Ps2:1-Ps2:12), [45](https://ref.ly/Ps45:1-Ps45:17), [60](https://ref.ly/Ps60:1-Ps60:12); [Isa 11](https://ref.ly/Isa11:1-Isa11:16); [Ezek 21:26–27](https://ref.ly/Ezek21:26-Ezek21:27); [Zech 9:9](https://ref.ly/Zech9:9); [Rev 5:5](https://ref.ly/Rev5:5)). • from his descendants: Literally *from between his feet,* a poetic euphemism for reproductive organs. • until the coming of the one to whom it belongs (Or *until tribute is brought to him and the peoples obey;* traditionally rendered *until Shiloh comes*): These differences arise from ambiguities in the Hebrew text. Rule of Israel belongs to Judah’s descendant through David’s line ([2 Sam 7:8–16](https://ref.ly/2Sam7:8-2Sam7:16)), and he will eventually rule all nations, as signified by the bringing of *tribute* (see [Pss 68:29](https://ref.ly/Ps68:29); [72:8–11](https://ref.ly/Ps72:8-Ps72:11); [Isa 2:2–4](https://ref.ly/Isa2:2-Isa2:4); [Eph 4:8–10](https://ref.ly/Eph4:8-Eph4:10)).

These descriptions envision the abundance of the Messiah’s kingdom (see [Isa 61:6–7](https://ref.ly/Isa61:6-Isa61:7); [65:21–25](https://ref.ly/Isa65:21-Isa65:25); [Zech 3:10](https://ref.ly/Zech3:10)). When the Messiah comes, there will be paradise\-like splendor and abundance on the earth. • He ties his foal to a grapevine: Grapevines will be so abundant that they will be used for hitching posts, and wine will be as abundant as fresh water (see [Amos 9:13–14](https://ref.ly/Amos9:13-Amos9:14); [Zech 3:10](https://ref.ly/Zech3:10)). • The coming one will have eyes . . . darker than wine and teeth . . . whiter than milk: He will be vigorous and healthy, as will be the era of his rule. Jesus’ miracle of changing water into wine ([John 2:1–12](https://ref.ly/John2:1-John2:12)), his first sign, was an announcement that the Messiah had come; it was a foretaste of even better things to come.

The oracle said Zebulun would dwell by the sea and be a safe harbor, but in the actual settlement they spread inland (see [Josh 19:10–16](https://ref.ly/Josh19:10-Josh19:16)). The oracle did not give specific borders for the tribes.

## Genesis 49:19 (id: 12904)

Three of the six Hebrew words in this verse are wordplays on the name Gad (“attack”). Gad will be attacked by marauding bands (attackers), but he will attack. The tribes that settled east of the Jordan River frequently experienced border raids (see [Josh 13](https://ref.ly/Josh13:1-Josh13:33); [2 Kgs 10:32–33](https://ref.ly/2Kgs10:32-2Kgs10:33); [1 Chr 5:18–19](https://ref.ly/1Chr5:18-1Chr5:19)).

This oracle treats Joseph more expansively than any of the others, for here the main blessing lay (see [1 Chr 5:1–2](https://ref.ly/1Chr5:1-1Chr5:2)). Jacob lavished promises of victory and prosperity on Joseph’s two tribes. Ephraimites recorded as victorious in battle include Joshua ([Josh 6](https://ref.ly/Josh6:1-Josh6:27), [8](https://ref.ly/Josh8:1-Josh8:35), [10](https://ref.ly/Josh10:1-Josh10:43), [12](https://ref.ly/Josh12:1-Josh12:24)) and Deborah ([Judg 4](https://ref.ly/Judg4:1-Judg4:24)).

The company of the faithful would wait in expectation for that to happen. • Like his father before him, Joseph made his brothers promise that his bones would be taken out of Egypt when God would come to take them (to help you and lead you back) to Canaan (see [Exod 13:19](https://ref.ly/Exod13:19); [Josh 24:32](https://ref.ly/Josh24:32); [Heb 11:22](https://ref.ly/Heb11:22)).
