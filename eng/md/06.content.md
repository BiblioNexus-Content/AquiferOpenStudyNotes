## Joshua 1:1–2 (id: 19310)

Moses had died on Mount Nebo east of the Jordan ([Deut 34:1–5](https://ref.ly/Deut34:1-Deut34:5)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:1–JOS 1:2

## Joshua 1:1–9 (id: 19311)

God confirmed Joshua as Israel’s leader and Moses’ successor. God made Abraham a specific promise to bring his descendants into possession of the land of Canaan ([Gen 12:7](https://ref.ly/Gen12:7); [15:7](https://ref.ly/Gen15:7); [17:8](https://ref.ly/Gen17:8)). This promise was repeated to Moses ([Exod 3:6–8](https://ref.ly/Exod3:6-Exod3:8); [13:3–5](https://ref.ly/Exod13:3-Exod13:5); [Deut 1:6–8](https://ref.ly/Deut1:6-Deut1:8); [6:10–19](https://ref.ly/Deut6:10-Deut6:19)). Now God was ready to fulfill his promise using Joshua. Joshua led Israel’s first generation of settlers into the Promised Land, and his victories against two Canaanite coalitions—first in the south and then in the north—opened the hill country for settlement by the Israelites.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:1–JOS 1:9

## Joshua 1:3 (id: 19319)

Moses’ death did not end God’s presence with or guidance of Israel.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:3

## Joshua 1:4 (id: 19320)

Ancient Israel’s southernmost settlement was in the Negev*,* in the vicinity of Beersheba ([15:28](https://ref.ly/Josh15:28)). Israel’s northernmost tribes settled in portions of the Lebanon mountains*,* which made them neighbors of the Sidonians. • The Hittites were one of the subgroups that made up Canaan’s population (see study note on 3:10).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:4
* **Associated Articles:** Joshua 3:10 (ID: `19558@TyndaleStudyNotes`)

## Joshua 1:5 (id: 19321)

God promised never to fail or abandon Joshua, just as he had promised Moses (cp. [Deut 31:6–8](https://ref.ly/Deut31:6-Deut31:8)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:5

## Joshua 1:6 (id: 19323)

you are the one: God delegated Joshua as the primary agent to fulfill the promise he had given to their ancestors (see [Exod 6:8](https://ref.ly/Exod6:8)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:6

## Joshua 1:6–9 (id: 19322)

For emphasis, God told Joshua three times that he would need to be strong and courageous in order to be successful against the Canaanites, who outnumbered Israel. The people would also need to be careful to obey all the instructions Moses had given them if Israel were to settle the land, establish productive farms, and build homes, villages, and cities. The land is God’s land, as is the whole earth ([Ps 24:1](https://ref.ly/Ps24:1)); God brought Israel into Canaan as tenants, not as owners ([Lev 25:23](https://ref.ly/Lev25:23)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:6–JOS 1:9

## Joshua 1:8 (id: 19324)

This Book of Instruction (Hebrew torah) probably refers to the book of Deuteronomy (see [Deut 4:44](https://ref.ly/Deut4:44); [29:21](https://ref.ly/Deut29:21); [30:10](https://ref.ly/Deut30:10); [31:9–12](https://ref.ly/Deut31:9-Deut31:12)). It includes Israel’s foundational law codes as well as God’s moral and spiritual instructions. • God commanded Joshua to think and speak of God’s instruction day and night—i.e., continually (cp. [Deut 6:6–7](https://ref.ly/Deut6:6-Deut6:7); [17:18–20](https://ref.ly/Deut17:18-Deut17:20)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:8

## Joshua 1:9 (id: 19325)

As the Israelites entered Canaan, they would fight the worshipers of the Canaanite gods, but they were afraid these gods would grant the Canaanites victory in battle. In reassuring Joshua, God used his personal name the Lord (Hebrew Yahweh*;* see study note on Exod 3:15) to remind Joshua that the Lord was more powerful than any false gods the Canaanites might invoke. • your God is with you: God’s continuous presence made it possible for Joshua to heed God’s instruction.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:9
* **Associated Articles:** Exodus 3:15 (ID: `11277@TyndaleStudyNotes`)

## Joshua 1:10 (id: 19312)

commanded: Joshua now began leading God’s people.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:10

## Joshua 1:11 (id: 19313)

Because of fear and unbelief, the previous generation had refused to enter the Promised Land from the south forty years earlier (see [Num 13–14](https://ref.ly/Num13:1-Num14:45)). The current generation would now enter from the east, across the Jordan River.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:11

## Joshua 1:12–15 (id: 19314)

Reuben, Gad, and the half\-tribe of Manasseh had requested and received from Moses the conquered land east of the Jordan ([Num 32:33](https://ref.ly/Num32:33)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:12–JOS 1:15

## Joshua 1:13 (id: 19315)

God wanted the people of Israel to experience the spiritual, cultural, and emotional rest of a right relationship with him and each other, not just the physical rest of living in a secure and abundant land (see [Heb 4:1–11](https://ref.ly/Heb4:1-Heb4:11)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:13

## Joshua 1:14 (id: 19316)

The warriors of the 2½ tribes had promised to cross the Jordan with the rest of Israel to help them conquer their land ([Num 32:16–19](https://ref.ly/Num32:16-Num32:19)). Joshua reminded them of their obligation.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:14

## Joshua 1:17 (id: 19317)

Israel often did not obey . . . Moses. However, the tribes living east of the Jordan did cross with the rest of Israel, and they did not return to their own land and homes until Joshua dismissed them ([22:6](https://ref.ly/Josh22:6)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:17

## Joshua 1:18 (id: 19318)

Disobeying God’s chosen ruler was treason against God himself.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:18

## Joshua 2:1 (id: 19464)

Acacia Grove was about eight miles east of the Jordan River on the plains of Moab, across from Jericho (see[Num 25:1](https://ref.ly/Num25:1)). • In the house of a prostitute strangers could avoid unwanted attention. According to tradition, Rahab was an innkeeper as well as a prostitute (Josephus, *Antiquities* 5\.1\.2\). Other evidence from the ancient Near East suggests that women who owned and operated inns were often prostitutes.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 2:1

## Joshua 2:1–24 (id: 19457)

Like any good military commander, Joshua sent out spies or scouts to get information about his objective. • Because Israel planned to approach Canaan from the east, they could not bypass Jericho.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 2:1–JOS 2:24

## Joshua 2:2 (id: 19466)

The spies’ speech probably gave them away. Hebrew and Canaanite were both dialects of the same language but with differences in vocabulary and grammar.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 2:2

## Joshua 2:3 (id: 19467)

Jericho’s king assumed Rahab was both loyal to the city and unaware of the men’s mission.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 2:3

## Joshua 2:4–5 (id: 19468)

It is not necessary either to condone or condemn Rahab’s lying to the king’s messengers. She might have had no concept of any ethical standards God had given Israel. Or the higher ethical value of saving lives might supersede the normal requirement to be truthful.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 2:4–JOS 2:5

## Joshua 2:6 (id: 19469)

The inner fibers of flax were processed to make linen. The first step involved laying out the flax stems to dry on the flat rooftop.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 2:6

## Joshua 2:7 (id: 19470)

Medium\-sized towns such as Jericho had one main gate made of two very large wooden doors reinforced with bronze. The gate was barred for the night and opened again in the morning. By shutting the gate immediately after the pursuers departed, the authorities took a sensible precaution: If the spies had not left the town as Rahab implied, they might still be found in Jericho during the night.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 2:7

## Joshua 2:9–10 (id: 19471)

Rahab began to declare her faith in the Lord. • made a dry path: God had parted the waters of the Red Sea for Israel ([Exod 14:21–28](https://ref.ly/Exod14:21-Exod14:28)). • Israel had defeated Sihon and Og ([Num 21:21–35](https://ref.ly/Num21:21-Num21:35)). • completely destroyed: See [Lev 27:28–29](https://ref.ly/Lev27:28-Lev27:29); [1 Sam 15:3](https://ref.ly/1Sam15:3).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 2:9–JOS 2:10

## Joshua 2:11 (id: 19458)

Although the people of Canaan incurred God’s judgment, Rahab’s declaration of faith (proven genuine by her aid to the spies) brought her into the people of God ([Heb 11:31](https://ref.ly/Heb11:31)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 2:11

## Joshua 2:12–13 (id: 19459)

Rahab’s request demonstrated her faith in Israel and Israel’s God.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 2:12–JOS 2:13

## Joshua 2:14 (id: 19460)

When Israel attacked Jericho, Joshua and the two spies kept their promise to spare Rahab ([6:22](https://ref.ly/Josh6:22)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 2:14

## Joshua 2:15 (id: 19461)

Because Rahab’s house stood on the town wall, she could hide the men on the flat roof of her house ([2:6](https://ref.ly/Josh2:6)) and let them out through the window, down the outer side of the wall.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 2:15

## Joshua 2:16 (id: 19462)

The hill country of central Canaan began its steep rise just west of Jericho. Thinking that the two spies would head directly to Israel’s camp across the Jordan, the pursuers from Jericho would naturally head eastward. When the pursuers gave up, the spies could slip across the Jordan unhindered.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 2:16

## Joshua 2:19 (id: 19463)

it will not be our fault. But . . . we will accept the responsibility: The spies used a standard formula to accept responsibility for any of Rahab’s family remaining with her in her house, but not for those who did not.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 2:19

## Joshua 2:23–24 (id: 19465)

The spies’ report surely raised the spirits and morale of the Israelites.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 2:23–JOS 2:24

## Joshua 3:1 (id: 19565)

Israel had camped at Acacia Grove since before Balaam’s oracles ([Num 22–24](https://ref.ly/Num22:1-Num24:25)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 3:1

## Joshua 3:3 (id: 19566)

The Ark of the Covenant of the Lord was God’s dwelling place among the Israelites and symbolized his throne. Whenever Israel moved, a contingent of priests carried the Ark before them ([Exod 25:13–15](https://ref.ly/Exod25:13-Exod25:15); [Num 10:33–36](https://ref.ly/Num10:33-Num10:36)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 3:3

## Joshua 3:4 (id: 19567)

Stay about half a mile behind them: God did not want his people to take his presence for granted. They were to acknowledge his holiness with reverence, respect, and awe.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 3:4

## Joshua 3:5 (id: 19568)

Purify yourselves: They had to separate themselves from anything unclean that would bar an Israelite from coming into God’s presence (cp. [Exod 19:9–20](https://ref.ly/Exod19:9-Exod19:20); [Lev 11:44](https://ref.ly/Lev11:44)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 3:5

## Joshua 3:7 (id: 19569)

To reassure the people that he had not brought them this far to abandon them, God made Joshua a great leader like Moses.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 3:7

## Joshua 3:8 (id: 19570)

As they crossed the Jordan River, the Ark led the way until the feet of the priests entered the water; the priests were to stand in the Jordan, not on the dry land. By carrying the Ark into the water first, the obedient priests would show their faith (cp. [Jas 2:18](https://ref.ly/Jas2:18)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 3:8

## Joshua 3:10 (id: 19558)

Today you will know: The Israelites who were adults when Moses led Israel out of Egypt had died. The people now entering Canaan with Joshua had taken their place. The events about to unfold would signify God’s presence with them and demonstrate his intention to fulfill his promises. • In Canaan, the Israelites would be living among pagan neighbors and might be tempted to join them in worshiping their gods and goddesses. None of these false gods were worthy of worship. By contrast, the Lord is the living God, and he was present among the Israelites. • The Canaanites and Amorites were distinct peoples, but their names sometimes indicated all the pre\-Israelite peoples of Canaan. The Hittites were related to the earlier Hittite Empire of Asia Minor that controlled much of Canaan. The Jebusites were from the city\-state of Jerusalem, which Israel did not conquer fully until David’s time. Little is known about the other three groups.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 3:10

## Joshua 3:11 (id: 19559)

Because the Ark of the Covenant went ahead of the Israelites, they knew that the Lord of the whole earth was leading them into Canaan. Their God was not a limited local deity.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 3:11

## Joshua 3:12 (id: 19560)

Joshua told the people to choose twelve men but did not reveal what this group of men would be doing ([4:2–8](https://ref.ly/Josh4:2-Josh4:8)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 3:12

## Joshua 3:13 (id: 19561)

Even though the Jordan was in its spring flood stage, the water stopped abruptly, an obvious miracle.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 3:13

## Joshua 3:15 (id: 19562)

The Jordan was overflowing its banks as a result of the spring runoff of the winter’s rainfall and snowfall, especially from Mount Hermon.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 3:15

## Joshua 3:16 (id: 19563)

Two wonders occurred. First, the water . . . began backing up above Adam (about twenty\-five miles away). Second, the entire bed of the river was dry, as remaining water drained to the Dead Sea.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 3:16

## Joshua 3:17 (id: 19564)

The repetition of the phrase on dry ground emphasizes that God performed a miracle.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 3:17

## Joshua 4:2 (id: 19575)

The twelve men represented Jacob’s twelve sons. The tribe of Levi was not counted because the Levites settled in designated cities among the other tribes ([Gen 49:5–7](https://ref.ly/Gen49:5-Gen49:7); [Num 1:49–52](https://ref.ly/Num1:49-Num1:52); [18:20](https://ref.ly/Num18:20)). However, the number of tribes remained at twelve because Joseph’s two sons (Ephraim and Manasseh) were accounted as separate tribes ([Gen 48:5](https://ref.ly/Gen48:5)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 4:2

## Joshua 4:5 (id: 19576)

Carrying the stone on a shoulder implies that the men each chose stones weighing some 100 pounds.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 4:5

## Joshua 4:6 (id: 19577)

Joshua twice ([4:21](https://ref.ly/Josh4:21)) told the Israelites to prepare to answer future generations. The stone memorial would serve as a teaching aid.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 4:6

## Joshua 4:9 (id: 19578)

A second memorial of twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan was submerged as soon as the river resumed its flow. The monument’s top would be visible in the dry summer seasons. • Their existence to this day indicates that the memorials stood for generations, until the final editing of the book (see Joshua Book Introduction, “Author and Date”).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 4:9

## Joshua 4:14 (id: 19571)

Now that God had brought the Israelites safely across the Jordan River, Israel recognized God’s presence with Joshua as a great leader and revered him as much as they had revered Moses. Their confidence in Joshua would be crucial in the years ahead.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 4:14

## Joshua 4:18 (id: 19572)

After Israel crossed the river, the Jordan overflowed its banks as before. These events could not occur without God’s intervention.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 4:18

## Joshua 4:19–20 (id: 19573)

The tenth day of the first month occurred a few days before Passover. • Gilgal became an important worship center for early Israel. Although its location is uncertain, it was somewhere just east or northeast of Jericho. Its name (which means “wheel of a cart,” cp. [Isa 28:28](https://ref.ly/Isa28:28)) implies that Joshua set the twelve stones in a circle (cp. study note on Josh 5:9).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 4:19–JOS 4:20
* **Associated Articles:** Joshua 5:9 (ID: `19592@TyndaleStudyNotes`)

## Joshua 4:24 (id: 19574)

In addition to future generations of Israelites, all the nations of the earth were to understand God’s power. At least some individuals in every group respond to the God who cares for them ([Rev 7:9–10](https://ref.ly/Rev7:9-Rev7:10)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 4:24

## Joshua 5:1 (id: 19587)

After news of Israel’s crossing of the Jordan River spread, all of southern Canaan was in a state of alert awaiting Israel’s expected invasion. • With Israel’s impossible crossing of the Jordan, the Canaanites lost heart and were paralyzed with fear. They knew they faced the people of a God more powerful than any they worshiped.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 5:1

## Joshua 5:2 (id: 19588)

Before the Israelites turned their attention to Jericho, God directed Joshua to perform the covenant renewal ceremony of circumcising all the males born in the forty years since the exodus from Egypt. Because the land was part of the covenant promise, Israel’s men needed to demonstrate their personal participation in the covenant through circumcision in order to enter into the land. • Flint is found in a natural state, so flint knives were mandated for circumcision as a symbol of purity or holiness.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 5:2

## Joshua 5:3 (id: 19589)

The name Gibeath\-haaraloth (“hill of foreskins”) suggests that the circumcision ritual took place on a hill outside Israel’s camp at Gilgal.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 5:3

## Joshua 5:4–7 (id: 19590)

This unexpected detour in the narrative provides an important reminder of Israel’s earlier refusal to believe that God would bring them safely into the land of Canaan ([Num 14](https://ref.ly/Num14:1-Num14:45)). This summary of God’s judgment upon their fathers reminded the present generation that trusting in God was still necessary if they were to occupy the land their ancestors had forfeited. Further, it signaled the completion of God’s judgment upon the earlier generation.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 5:4–JOS 5:7

## Joshua 5:8 (id: 19591)

until they were healed: Recovery from circumcision, a relatively minor surgery, usually takes about three days if no complications occur.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 5:8

## Joshua 5:9 (id: 19592)

Gilgal sounds like the Hebrew word galal (“to roll”)—this place was where God rolled away the reproach of Egypt.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 5:9

## Joshua 5:10 (id: 19579)

The Passover lamb was slain on the evening of the fourteenth day of the first month. Just as the Passover in Egypt marked the exodus from slavery, the celebration of this Passover in Canaan marked the attainment of the goal God had been leading the Israelites toward. This Passover also anticipated God’s promised rest for his people in their new land. • This was apparently the first Passover Israel had celebrated since they had been encamped at Sinai ([Num 9:1–5](https://ref.ly/Num9:1-Num9:5)). For the younger Israelites, it was their first Passover ever; for the older ones, their first since childhood. Celebrating the Passover after such a long lapse, particularly on the eve of the campaign to take the Promised Land, heightened both the joy and the solemnity of the occasion.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 5:10

## Joshua 5:11 (id: 19581)

Israel reinstituted the Festival of Unleavened Bread, observed for seven days following Passover ([Lev 23:6](https://ref.ly/Lev23:6)). The people ate unleavened bread and roasted grain, a favorite food of the harvest season (see [Ruth 2:14](https://ref.ly/Ruth2:14)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 5:11

## Joshua 5:11–12 (id: 19580)

God’s daily provision of manna ([Exod 16:31](https://ref.ly/Exod16:31); [Num 11:9](https://ref.ly/Num11:9)) could cease because the produce from the land was now available.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 5:11–JOS 5:12

## Joshua 5:12 (id: 19582)

Israel harvested the crops that the people of Jericho did not have time to harvest before Israel crossed the Jordan.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 5:12

## Joshua 5:13 (id: 19584)

Joshua was scouting the land and the city’s defenses near the town of Jericho to follow up on the report of the two spies ([2:23–24](https://ref.ly/Josh2:23-Josh2:24)). Joshua demonstrated personal courage when he approached the unknown figure whose sword was already drawn.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 5:13

## Joshua 5:13–15 (id: 19583)

The commander of the Lord’s army gave Joshua instructions for conducting the siege of Jericho ([6:2–5](https://ref.ly/Josh6:2-Josh6:5)). Like God’s earlier message to Joshua ([1:1–9](https://ref.ly/Josh1:1-Josh1:9)), this encounter was to encourage Joshua on the eve of action against the enemy.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 5:13–JOS 5:15

## Joshua 5:14 (id: 19585)

Joshua fell with his face to the ground in reverence when he understood who stood before him. Joshua’s action demonstrated that he was available for God’s service, wholeheartedly and without reservation. • Scholars disagree whether the commander was an appearance of God, the pre\-incarnate Christ, or an angel. His reference to himself as commander of the Lord’s army might imply that he was an angel. However, he did not prevent Joshua from worshiping him, as angels usually did (e.g., [Rev 22:8–9](https://ref.ly/Rev22:8-Rev22:9); cp. [Acts 10:25–26](https://ref.ly/Acts10:25-Acts10:26)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 5:14

## Joshua 5:15 (id: 19586)

Take off your sandals, for the place . . . is holy: This was what God told Moses at the burning bush ([Exod 3:5](https://ref.ly/Exod3:5)). Joshua certainly recognized the similarity. This encounter would have encouraged Joshua of God’s blessing on Israel’s first action against Canaan.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 5:15

## Joshua 6:1 (id: 19597)

Jericho guarded two important entrances into the heart of the hill country. If the Israelites did not conquer the city first, they would leave a well\-armed enemy at their back, standing between the Israelite forces and their families encamped at Gilgal. They had to conquer Jericho first.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 6:1

## Joshua 6:2 (id: 19605)

God’s reassuring words, “I have given you Jericho,” must have lifted Joshua’s spirits. All Joshua had to do was obey God, and he had a lifetime of practice at that.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 6:2

## Joshua 6:4 (id: 19606)

Seven is a biblical number of perfection. • The seven priests were to precede the Ark*,* the emblem of God’s presence, at the head of Israel’s forces. This arrangement symbolized that God himself fought against the town. Israel had only to march and observe, then shout and observe, and finally mop up after God delivered the town into their hands. • The ram’s horn (Hebrew shofar) could sound several pitches to signal either battle or worship. In battle, the shofar alerted troops or townsfolk to an enemy’s approach or sounded the call to advance or retreat.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 6:4

## Joshua 6:6–9 (id: 19607)

The Ark, the priests blowing the horns, and the military honor guard all symbolized God’s presence and his leadership of the siege.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 6:6–JOS 6:9

## Joshua 6:10–11 (id: 19593)

Warriors would often shout in battle to lift their morale and intimidate the enemy. • until I tell you: After thirteen circuits of Jericho by Israel’s army with only the sound of trumpets, the psychological shock when Jericho’s defenders heard shouting would be devastating.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 6:10–JOS 6:11

## Joshua 6:15 (id: 19594)

Marching around Jericho seven times on the seventh day again symbolized that this was God’s battle.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 6:15

## Joshua 6:16 (id: 19595)

Joshua’s command, “Shout! For the Lord has given you the town!” was not a device to cause Jericho’s walls to fall. Rather, Joshua exhorted the Israelites to celebrate God’s victory.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 6:16

## Joshua 6:17 (id: 19596)

completely destroyed: Joshua reminded his troops that the town and everything in it belonged to God as the firstfruits of their inheritance in the land of Canaan. See [Lev 27:28–29](https://ref.ly/Lev27:28-Lev27:29); [1 Sam 15:3](https://ref.ly/1Sam15:3). • Rahab: See [Josh 2:12–21](https://ref.ly/Josh2:12-Josh2:21).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 6:17

## Joshua 6:20 (id: 19598)

Following Joshua’s last\-minute commands, a final blast of the rams’ horns signaled the climax.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 6:20

## Joshua 6:22–23 (id: 19599)

The two spies fulfilled Joshua’s command and their oath to Rahab. Through the actions of God’s people, a pagan household saw that God is trustworthy. • the prostitute’s house: See study note on 2:1. • Moving Rahab and her family near the camp of Israel provided security.

## Joshua 6:26 (id: 19603)

Joshua placed a curse upon the site because Jericho was the first Canaanite town to resist God’s purposes in bringing Israel into the land. Jericho was also the first town to experience God’s judgment upon Canaan’s great wickedness. As the firstfruits of Israel’s conquest of Canaan, it belonged to God ([Exod 13:2](https://ref.ly/Exod13:2); [23:19](https://ref.ly/Exod23:19)). God executed Joshua’s curse on the first man to defy it ([1 Kgs 16:34](https://ref.ly/1Kgs16:34); cp. [Josh 7](https://ref.ly/Josh7:1-Josh7:26)).

## Joshua 7:1–26 (id: 19609)

Now that Jericho belonged to Israel, Joshua’s first military problem involved securing a foothold in the hill country. The conquest of Jericho inspired Israel’s confidence and consigned the people of Canaan to discouragement and despair. Yet everything hinged on Israel’s obedience to God.

## Joshua 7:2 (id: 19623)

As he did before the battle for Jericho, Joshua sent some of his men to assess the situation at Ai. This town stood about ten miles west of Jericho at the entrance to a plateau north of Jerusalem called the Plateau of Benjamin; conquering Ai would open the way for Israel to control the hill country. • Beth\-aven, “house of iniquity,” was probably an intentionally derogatory wordplay on the name Bethel, the “house of God.” A pagan shrine stood on this site later in Israel’s history ([1 Kgs 12:28–33](https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:28-1Kgs12:33)).

## Joshua 7:7 (id: 19627)

Joshua expressed his anger toward God; this explains the sharp tone of God’s reply ([7:10–15](https://ref.ly/Josh7:10-Josh7:15)). Though the battle had been lost because of Achan’s sin, Joshua and Israel’s elders had neglected to seek God’s guidance ([7:3](https://ref.ly/Josh7:3)). • Joshua did not really believe that Israel should have stayed on the other side of the Jordan. Rather, he used hyperbole to show that he was at a loss over what to do next.

God had commanded that all the stolen goods were to be destroyed by fire. Now they would be, because Achan and everything he had would be burned with fire.

## Joshua 10:12 (id: 19329)

Joshua prayed to have the day lengthened so the Israelites could finish the task without allowing the Amorite forces time to organize a new defense against Israel. • The sun and moon, two of Canaan’s most powerful gods, proved powerless against the Lord. • Aijalon was a city near the western end of the Beth\-horon road.

## Joshua 10:16 (id: 19331)

The five kings had led the southern coalition against God’s people. • Although the location of Makkedah is uncertain, it was in the same district as Lachish ([15:39–41](https://ref.ly/Josh15:39-Josh15:41)) in the southern part of the western foothills, about twenty\-five miles southwest of Jerusalem. Limestone caves are numerous in that region.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 10:16

## Joshua 11:1–3 (id: 19352)

Hazor lay along the international trade route and was by far the largest and most important inland city of Canaan (see [11:10](https://ref.ly/Josh11:10)). • Virtually all of northern Canaan joined the coalition of King Jabin against Israel. This region stretched from the Mediterranean Sea in the west to the desert in the east and from the borders of Phoenicia in the north to the hill country and the Jordan Valley in the south. • The term Jebusites typically refers to the people of Jerusalem and surrounding towns under its control. Perhaps men from Jebus were mercenaries to Jabin. • Mizpah means “watchtower” or “lookout.” Several places had this name; this one was the extensive region of the lower slopes of Mount Hermon*,* the highest peak of the Promised Land.

## Joshua 11:1–16 (id: 19351)

Through the more detailed accounts of Joshua’s campaign in southern Canaan (chs [6–10](https://ref.ly/Josh6:1-Josh10:43)), the narrator established firmly that the Israelites needed God’s help to succeed. Because what had been true in the southern campaign would also be true in the northern campaign (ch [11](https://ref.ly/Josh11:1-Josh11:23)), those details were unnecessary here.

## Joshua 11:4 (id: 19360)

In the ancient Near East at this time, horses only pulled chariots; cavalry and mounted bowmen did not appear until centuries later. • Israel probably faced chariots for the first time in this battle against the northern coalition, where the land was flatter than in southern Canaan. As the heavy weapons of the battlefield, chariots easily overpowered foot soldiers. Scythes were often attached to the axles, and charioteers drove at opposing infantry to mow them down.

the towns built on mounds: In the ancient Near East it was common practice to rebuild cities on the same sites after they had been destroyed. All the elements that made a city site advantageous remained after a city’s destruction. Many cities were rebuilt numerous times, slowly rising in height as more debris accumulated after each destruction. • Joshua burned only Hazor in the north, just as he had destroyed Jericho ([6:24](https://ref.ly/Josh6:24)) and Ai ([8:28](https://ref.ly/Josh8:28)) in the center of the land.

## Joshua 11:19–20 (id: 19357)

The judgment on Canaan was God’s, not Israel’s. God had extended mercy to the Canaanites for several generations. However, God determined that “the sins of the Amorites” now “warrant their destruction” ([Gen 15:16](https://ref.ly/Gen15:16)), and he hardened their hearts. God used Israel as the instrument and agent of his judgment, just as in later centuries God used other nations to execute judgment upon Israel and Judah for their sins.

## Joshua 12:3 (id: 19368)

Beth\-jeshimoth was Israel’s camp in the plains of Moab ([Num 33:49](https://ref.ly/Num33:49)). • Moses had viewed the Promised Land from Pisgah ([Deut 34:1](https://ref.ly/Deut34:1)).

King Og of Bashan: See [Num 21:33–35](https://ref.ly/Num21:33-Num21:35). • The Rephaites were an indigenous people who lived on both sides of the Jordan. Many scholars have concluded that the Rephaites were unusually tall (see [Deut 3:11](https://ref.ly/Deut3:11)). • Ashtaroth and Edrei: Many rulers of large kingdoms had palaces in more than one of their cities. The fact that Joshua credits only Og with more than one capital indicates that his kingdom was much larger than others Israel encountered, except for Sihon’s.

## Joshua 12:6 (id: 19370)

Reuben, Gad, and the half\-tribe of Manasseh: See [Num 32](https://ref.ly/Num32:1-Num32:42). The author of Joshua reminded the Israelites that their kin who lived east of the Jordan also belonged to Israel.

Joshua and the Israelite armies faithfully carried out the tasks God gave them. This summary showcases their successes, providing proper recognition for their faithfulness. God gave the Israelites their promised inheritance while bringing about the long\-delayed judgment of the Canaanites.

Israel did not conquer the entire land of Canaan while Joshua was alive. The unconquered areas, lying mostly in the valleys and plains, were the most populous regions. Several generations passed before Israel became strong enough to absorb or subjugate these regions and their peoples.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 13:1–JOS 13:7

## Joshua 13:1–21.45 (id: 19374)

As he had promised, God brought Israel into the land. Joshua next turned his attention to the allotment of the land to Israel’s tribes. • The tribal allotments gave geographical reality to the Israelites’ covenant with God and expressed the fulfillment of God’s promise to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Because God owned the land, the apportionment to the tribes was a gift. God gave them the land to dwell in and directed its distribution. • In these lists of tribal allotments, the author describes some borders in such detail that they can be plotted on a map while others were far less well defined.

## Joshua 13:2 (id: 19382)

The Philistines were one of several groups in the great migration of the Sea Peoples from the Aegean region within a few decades after Israel’s entry into Canaan. They settled along the southwestern Mediterranean coast, west and southwest of Judah. They came from Caphtor or Crete ([Deut 2:23](https://ref.ly/Deut2:23); [Amos 9:7](https://ref.ly/Amos9:7)). • These Geshurites were people from a southern territory, not the northern Geshurites (cp. [Josh 12:5](https://ref.ly/Josh12:5)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 13:2

## Joshua 13:3 (id: 19384)

The stream of Shihor probably marked the traditional boundary between Canaan and Egypt, bisecting the northern Sinai Peninsula. • The Philistine territory included five main cities: Gaza, Ashdod, and Ashkelon were on the Mediterranean coast, and Gath and Ekron were a few miles inland. • The Philistines displaced the Avvites ([Deut 2:23](https://ref.ly/Deut2:23)).

## Joshua 13:8–14 (id: 19387)

Half the tribe of Manasseh and the tribes of Reuben and Gad had asked Moses for their inheritance on the east side of the Jordan in the land that had been the kingdoms of Sihon and Og ([Num 21:21–35](https://ref.ly/Num21:21-Num21:35); [32:1–42](https://ref.ly/Num32:1-Num32:42)). In return, they had helped the rest of Israel take possession of their inheritance west of the Jordan ([Josh 1:12–18](https://ref.ly/Josh1:12-Josh1:18); [4:12–13](https://ref.ly/Josh4:12-Josh4:13)). Here, the author confirmed their possession of these lands.

## Joshua 13:14 (id: 19376)

The tribe of Levi inherited no tribal land of its own (see [Deut 18:1–8](https://ref.ly/Deut18:1-Deut18:8)). Levitical cities were located in the territories of the other tribes ([Josh 21](https://ref.ly/Josh21:1-Josh21:45)).

The failures of Judah’s elder brothers ([Gen 34:25–31](https://ref.ly/Gen34:25-Gen34:31); [35:22](https://ref.ly/Gen35:22)) put him in line to receive the mantle of leadership. Thus, the tribe of Judah received a central geographical position among the tribes, guaranteeing its leadership in the nation ([Gen 49:8–12](https://ref.ly/Gen49:8-Gen49:12); [Deut 33:7](https://ref.ly/Deut33:7)).

Some propose translating this word as “Arad” because Arad should be about here in the list and was too important to have been left out. This translation would simply reverse two Hebrew letters that are very similar in shape.

## Joshua 15:33 (id: 19405)

From the perspective of the highlanders of the Judean hill country, the lower hills between them and the coastal plain were the western foothills. These hills were separated geologically from the hill country by a series of north–south valleys. In this list, the western foothills are divided into four districts.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 15:33

## Joshua 15:45–47 (id: 19406)

The fourth district of the western foothills included most of the territory soon to be occupied by the Philistines—the tribe of Judah held it only briefly.

## Joshua 15:48 (id: 19407)

The hill country was in the central highlands of Judah from Jerusalem in the north to just past Debir ([15:15](https://ref.ly/Josh15:15)) in the south. It was divided into five districts.

Following this verse, the Greek Old Testament includes another district of 11 cities: Tekoa, Ephrathah (that is, Bethlehem), Phagor, Etam, Kulon, Tatam, Saris, Karem, Gallim, Bether, Manoch—eleven towns with their surrounding villages. The inclusion of this district accounts for Bethlehem; this town’s omission would be surprising. Perhaps an early copyist of the Hebrew text accidentally omitted this twelfth district.

Joseph had two sons,Manasseh and Ephraim ([Gen 41:50–52](https://ref.ly/Gen41:50-Gen41:52)). Half of Manasseh’s descendants had received their inheritance east of the Jordan River. The tribe of Ephraim and the rest of the tribe of Manasseh now received their allotments. This brought the total number of allotments to twelve and fulfilled the blessing Jacob had pronounced upon Joseph ([Gen 49:22–26](https://ref.ly/Gen49:22-Gen49:26)). Like Judah in the south, Joseph’s tribes exercised leadership from their central position in the north.

## Joshua 17:3–6 (id: 19427)

In ancient Israel, inheritance usually passed from a father to his sons. Without sons, a man’s name could pass into oblivion. However, Zelophehad’s daughters had petitioned Moses, Moses had inquired of God, and God had ruled that they should inherit their father’s portion (see [Num 27:1–11](https://ref.ly/Num27:1-Num27:11)). God’s ruling established a general principle, declaring that no family would be excluded from a portion of God’s material blessings.

## Joshua 17:13 (id: 19421)

Throughout the period of the judges and beyond, the Israelites gradually grew stronger and the Canaanite people weaker. After the time of Joshua, the Israelites forced the Canaanites to work as slaves. They eventually absorbed these people and were influenced to worship the Canaanite gods. This idolatry ultimately cost them the land.

As a result of the Canaanites’ iron chariots, Ephraim and Manasseh were restricted to the hill country in the early part of the settlement period (see study note on 11:4). • The valley of Jezreel, a geological interruption of the hill country, separated Lower Galilee to the north from the hill country of Manasseh to the south. The Canaanites living in and near it and the valley of Beth\-shan restricted Manasseh’s expansion and apparently Ephraim’s as well. Most of the towns named in [17:11](https://ref.ly/Josh17:11) were on the edges of these valleys.

## Joshua 17:17–18 (id: 19425)

Rather than rebuke the people for their fear, Joshua repeated his instructions to clear forest land for settlement. His promise that the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh would eventually drive out the Canaanites gave them a hope by which they could enlarge their faith and conquer their fear. • Much of the hill country was forested, and Canaanite settlement was sparse there. If Ephraim and Manasseh had contented themselves with land already cleared, they would have had little room for settlement. With the introduction of iron technology at about this time, including iron axe heads, the people of these tribes could clear the virgin forests and open up new land for settlement. Joshua might have set an example by being the first to clear his own homestead at Timnath\-serah ([19:50](https://ref.ly/Josh19:50)), a forested region in the Ephraimite hill country.

While Judah’s land included eleven or twelve districts (see study note on 15:59), the tribe of Benjamin had two, totaling twenty\-six towns. However, the location between the lands of Judah and Joseph gave Benjamin an economic and military importance significantly greater than its size.

## Joshua 19:1 (id: 19447)

Simeon, Jacob and Leah’s second son, was older than Judah. However, he had forfeited a leading role with his violent actions against Shechem ([Gen 34:25–26](https://ref.ly/Gen34:25-Gen34:26)). The tribal inheritance of his descendants reflected this; their land was carved out of Judah’s territory on the southern periphery of the Negev. This arid land was far from any centers of influence and power.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 19:1

## Joshua 19:2–9 (id: 19448)

Some of the towns given to the tribe of Simeon were also part of Judah’s allocation because Judah’s territory was too large for them (cp. [17:14–18](https://ref.ly/Josh17:14-Josh17:18)). Judah apparently absorbed most of Simeon’s territory into its own before the end of the Old Testament period.

The tribe of Naphtali occupied eastern Galilee and overlooked the Sea of Galilee. Because a branch of an international trade route from Egypt to Mesopotamia ran through the territory of Naphtali, this tribe enjoyed periods of prosperity when Israel’s kings were strong. The city of Hazor was within Naphtali’s territory, guarding a section of that route.

The Philistines were among the Sea Peoples who had perhaps been driven out of the Greek mainland and the Greek islands by an invasion from the north. The Sea Peoples also invaded and destroyed the Hittite Empire to the north of Israel. (Some scholars think that Homer’s *Iliad* reflects this movement.)

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 19:43

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 22:11

## Joshua 22:12 (id: 19491)

The western tribes were ready to go to war because they saw the altar as violating [Lev 17:8–9](https://ref.ly/Lev17:8-Lev17:9) and [Deut 13:12–15](https://ref.ly/Deut13:12-Deut13:15).

## Joshua 22:13–14 (id: 19492)

delegation: See [Deut 13:14](https://ref.ly/Deut13:14). • The ten tribes west of the Jordan included Ephraim and the western half of Manasseh but not the tribe of Levi.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 22:13–JOS 22:14

## Joshua 22:15 (id: 19494)

The delegation crossed the Jordan River to meet the leaders of the eastern tribes in the land of Gilead, probably in southern Gad.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 22:15

## Joshua 22:15–20 (id: 19493)

The direct and hard\-hitting statements and questions of the delegation made sure that God’s wrath would not come upon the nation because of rebellion like Achan’s ([7:1–15](https://ref.ly/Josh7:1-Josh7:15)) or the episode at Peor ([Num 25](https://ref.ly/Num25:1-Num25:18)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 22:15–JOS 22:20

## Joshua 22:16 (id: 19495)

The delegation brought the message the ten tribes had agreed upon when they met at Shiloh. • The whole community of the Lord demands to know (literally *Thus says the whole congregation of the* Lord): The formula using “thus says” was a typical introduction to a messenger’s report (e.g., [Ezra 1:2](https://ref.ly/Ezra1:2); [Isa 28:16](https://ref.ly/Isa28:16)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 22:16

## Joshua 22:17 (id: 19496)

The sin at Peor was Israel’s idolatrous rebellion in Moab, just at the point of entering the Promised Land ([Num 25](https://ref.ly/Num25:1-Num25:18)). Phinehas, now the leader of this delegation, had acted to save Israel from complete destruction at that time. He did not want to see any part of Israel turn away from God again.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 22:17

## Joshua 22:19 (id: 19497)

Being defiled was not necessarily the result of rebellion or a moral lapse, but it did prevent persons or groups from participating in regular worship activities, including the offering of sacrifices. If the eastern tribes had defiled the land itself, the Israelites could not offer sacrifices to the Lord within it. This concern provides evidence that the eastern tribes had built their altar on the western bank of the Jordan. • The land west of the Jordan was considered the Lord’s land. The delegation from the western tribes made a very generous offer, inviting the eastern tribes to share their land. This demonstrated their commitment to national unity in faithfulness to God.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 22:19

## Joshua 22:20 (id: 19499)

Achan: See ch [7](https://ref.ly/Josh7:1-Josh7:26). The delegation of western tribes feared that Achan’s sin and its consequences would be repeated.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 22:20

## Joshua 22:21–34 (id: 19500)

The eastern tribes defended their action.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 22:21–JOS 22:34

## Joshua 22:22 (id: 19501)

The Lord . . . is God! The two\-fold repetition of this dramatic affirmation indicated how shocked the eastern tribes were when accused of rebellion.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 22:22

## Joshua 22:23 (id: 19502)

The eastern tribes swore by the name of the Lord that they were not guilty. • The instructions for sacrifices prescribed burnt offerings or grain offerings or peace offerings ([Lev 1–3](https://ref.ly/Lev1:1-Lev3:17)). At this time, Israel’s worship was centered at the Tabernacle in Shiloh. To offer sacrifices anywhere but the central sanctuary was a violation of God’s covenant.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 22:23

## Joshua 22:24–29 (id: 19503)

The eastern tribes feared exclusion from Israel at a later time because the Jordan River divided them from the western tribes.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 22:24–JOS 22:29

## Joshua 22:27 (id: 19504)

The altar near the bank of the Jordan would stand as a memorial (literally *witness*) through the generations that the eastern tribes were also part of Israel.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 22:27

## Joshua 22:28 (id: 19505)

This altar was a copy, intended to be seen, not used.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 22:28

## Joshua 22:31 (id: 19506)

you have rescued: In his reply to the eastern tribes, Phinehas used very similar language to the words God had spoken when Phinehas turned God’s anger from Israel at Peor ([Num 25:11](https://ref.ly/Num25:11)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 22:31

## Joshua 22:33 (id: 19507)

Both the eastern and western tribes were relieved that the crisis had been averted, and they joyfully praised God to renew their affirmation of national unity in faithfulness to God.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 22:33

## Joshua 22:34 (id: 19508)

Witness: Hebrew texts that include this word interpret the last statement as an explanation of the name. Texts that omit the word understand the last quotation to be the name of the altar.

## Joshua 23:1–11 (id: 19513)

Joshua urged Israel’s leaders to be faithful.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 23:1–JOS 23:11

## Joshua 23:2–3 (id: 19520)

The leaders . . . of Israel had experienced what God had done for them and to their enemies. Throughout the lifetimes of these leaders who outlived Joshua, Israel continued to be faithful to God ([Judg 2:7](https://ref.ly/Judg2:7)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 23:2–JOS 23:3

## Joshua 23:4–5 (id: 19521)

Some of the land that Joshua had assigned to the various tribes remained unconquered. Israel’s gradual occupation of the land had an ecological reason (see [Exod 23:29–30](https://ref.ly/Exod23:29-Exod23:30)), a military reason (see [Judg 1:19](https://ref.ly/Judg1:19)), and a theological reason (see[Judg 2:20–3:4](https://ref.ly/Judg2:20-Judg3:4)). Israel’s ensuing unfaithfulness delayed the settlement process by several centuries; instead of driving out the remaining Canaanites, Israel absorbed them, bringing God’s people even greater temptations to unfaithfulness. Joshua knew this to be a real danger ([Josh 23:15–16](https://ref.ly/Josh23:15-Josh23:16)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 23:4–JOS 23:5

## Joshua 23:6 (id: 19522)

Since before crossing the Jordan River to take the land of Canaan, Joshua’s guiding principle had been to be very careful to follow everything Moses wrote and not deviate. Now he passed on these instructions to the leaders who would succeed him in leading Israel.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 23:6

## Joshua 23:7 (id: 19523)

Do not even mention . . . swear by . . . serve . . . or worship them: These four actions describe progressive involvement with idolatry.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 23:7

## Joshua 23:8 (id: 19524)

To cling tightly or passionately to God would render impotent the temptation to stray off toward other gods. This same verb described a man clinging to his wife ([Gen 2:24](https://ref.ly/Gen2:24)) and Ruth clinging to Naomi ([Ruth 1:14](https://ref.ly/Ruth1:14)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 23:8

## Joshua 23:9 (id: 19525)

Examples of great and powerful nations included the Anakim ([11:21–22](https://ref.ly/Josh11:21-Josh11:22)) and the city of Hazor ([11:10](https://ref.ly/Josh11:10)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 23:9

## Joshua 23:10 (id: 19514)

God fights for you: Just as God had fought for the Israelites in the past (e.g., [10:11–14](https://ref.ly/Josh10:11-Josh10:14)), he would continue to fight for them in the future.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 23:10

## Joshua 23:11 (id: 19515)

be very careful to love: Love is a function of will and intention. Emotion and attraction are the results, not the essence, of love. Because love is (or is not) willed, love can be commanded but not coerced.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 23:11

## Joshua 23:12 (id: 19517)

Joshua warned God’s people not to intermarry with their polytheistic neighbors because such an intimate relationship would lead the Israelites astray ([Deut 7:3–4](https://ref.ly/Deut7:3-Deut7:4)). However, Canaanites who desired to worship the Lord and join God’s people were welcomed ([Josh 6:25](https://ref.ly/Josh6:25); [Ruth 4:10](https://ref.ly/Ruth4:10)). Race, language, and ethnicity had no bearing on God’s prohibition of intermarriage; it was a matter of faithfulness to the Lord (cp.[2 Cor 6:14–15](https://ref.ly/2Cor6:14-2Cor6:15)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 23:12

## Joshua 23:12–16 (id: 19516)

Apostasy—turning away from the true God—is fatal. • Because God is holy, Joshua could speak with optimism regarding God’s promises and the good land into which God had brought them. God will not change his holy character even if his people change. The rebellion of God’s people cannot damage his holiness, but rebellion will destroy those who rebel.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 23:12–JOS 23:16

## Joshua 23:13 (id: 19518)

will no longer drive them out: If Israel associated with the Canaanite remnant, God would oblige the Israelites by not driving out that remnant. God ultimately gives people what they seek.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 23:13

## Joshua 23:15–16 (id: 19519)

God had blessed the Israelites, and he would also certainly judge them if they turned away from him. Joshua’s warning against apostasy was prophetic; Israel did turn away, and God did not drive out the remaining Canaanites ([Judg 2:20–23](https://ref.ly/Judg2:20-Judg2:23)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 23:15–JOS 23:16

In both form and content, this statement of covenant resembled an ancient Near Eastern suzerain\-vassal treaty. It begins with a preamble ([24:2](https://ref.ly/Josh24:2)) and continues with a historical prologue relating the suzerain’s (God’s) gracious acts on behalf of the people ([24:3–13](https://ref.ly/Josh24:3-Josh24:13)), followed by a list of stipulations ([24:14–15](https://ref.ly/Josh24:14-Josh24:15)) and curses and blessings ([24:19–20](https://ref.ly/Josh24:19-Josh24:20)). It then notes where the text was to be deposited for periodic reading and renewal (implied, [24:26](https://ref.ly/Josh24:26)) and lists witnesses to the covenant ([24:22](https://ref.ly/Josh24:22), [27](https://ref.ly/Josh24:27)).
