## Joshua 1:1–2 (id: 19310)

Moses had died on Mount Nebo east of the Jordan ([Deut 34:1–5](https://ref.ly/Deut34:1-Deut34:5)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:1–JOS 1:2
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joshua 1:1–9 (id: 19311)

God confirmed Joshua as Israel’s leader and Moses’ successor. God made Abraham a specific promise to bring his descendants into possession of the land of Canaan ([Gen 12:7](https://ref.ly/Gen12:7); [15:7](https://ref.ly/Gen15:7); [17:8](https://ref.ly/Gen17:8)). This promise was repeated to Moses ([Exod 3:6–8](https://ref.ly/Exod3:6-Exod3:8); [13:3–5](https://ref.ly/Exod13:3-Exod13:5); [Deut 1:6–8](https://ref.ly/Deut1:6-Deut1:8); [6:10–19](https://ref.ly/Deut6:10-Deut6:19)). Now God was ready to fulfill his promise using Joshua. Joshua led Israel’s first generation of settlers into the Promised Land, and his victories against two Canaanite coalitions—first in the south and then in the north—opened the hill country for settlement by the Israelites.

## Joshua 1:3 (id: 19319)

Moses’ death did not end God’s presence with or guidance of Israel.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:3
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joshua 1:4 (id: 19320)

Ancient Israel’s southernmost settlement was in the Negev*,* in the vicinity of Beersheba ([15:28](https://ref.ly/Josh15:28)). Israel’s northernmost tribes settled in portions of the Lebanon mountains*,* which made them neighbors of the Sidonians. • The Hittites were one of the subgroups that made up Canaan’s population (see study note on 3:10).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:4
* **Associated Articles:** Joshua 3:10 (ID: 19558)

## Joshua 1:5 (id: 19321)

God promised never to fail or abandon Joshua, just as he had promised Moses (cp. [Deut 31:6–8](https://ref.ly/Deut31:6-Deut31:8)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:5
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joshua 1:6 (id: 19323)

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:6
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joshua 1:6–9 (id: 19322)

For emphasis, God told Joshua three times that he would need to be strong and courageous in order to be successful against the Canaanites, who outnumbered Israel. The people would also need to be careful to obey all the instructions Moses had given them if Israel were to settle the land, establish productive farms, and build homes, villages, and cities. The land is God’s land, as is the whole earth ([Ps 24:1](https://ref.ly/Ps24:1)); God brought Israel into Canaan as tenants, not as owners ([Lev 25:23](https://ref.ly/Lev25:23)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:6–JOS 1:9
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joshua 1:8 (id: 19324)

This Book of Instruction (Hebrew torah) probably refers to the book of Deuteronomy (see [Deut 4:44](https://ref.ly/Deut4:44); [29:21](https://ref.ly/Deut29:21); [30:10](https://ref.ly/Deut30:10); [31:9–12](https://ref.ly/Deut31:9-Deut31:12)). It includes Israel’s foundational law codes as well as God’s moral and spiritual instructions. • God commanded Joshua to think and speak of God’s instruction day and night—i.e., continually (cp. [Deut 6:6–7](https://ref.ly/Deut6:6-Deut6:7); [17:18–20](https://ref.ly/Deut17:18-Deut17:20)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:8
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joshua 1:9 (id: 19325)

As the Israelites entered Canaan, they would fight the worshipers of the Canaanite gods, but they were afraid these gods would grant the Canaanites victory in battle. In reassuring Joshua, God used his personal name the Lord (Hebrew Yahweh*;* see study note on Exod 3:15) to remind Joshua that the Lord was more powerful than any false gods the Canaanites might invoke. • your God is with you: God’s continuous presence made it possible for Joshua to heed God’s instruction.

Because of fear and unbelief, the previous generation had refused to enter the Promised Land from the south forty years earlier (see [Num 13–14](https://ref.ly/Num13:1-Num14:45)). The current generation would now enter from the east, across the Jordan River.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:11
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joshua 1:12–15 (id: 19314)

Reuben, Gad, and the half\-tribe of Manasseh had requested and received from Moses the conquered land east of the Jordan ([Num 32:33](https://ref.ly/Num32:33)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:12–JOS 1:15
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joshua 1:13 (id: 19315)

God wanted the people of Israel to experience the spiritual, cultural, and emotional rest of a right relationship with him and each other, not just the physical rest of living in a secure and abundant land (see [Heb 4:1–11](https://ref.ly/Heb4:1-Heb4:11)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:13
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joshua 1:14 (id: 19316)

The warriors of the 2½ tribes had promised to cross the Jordan with the rest of Israel to help them conquer their land ([Num 32:16–19](https://ref.ly/Num32:16-Num32:19)). Joshua reminded them of their obligation.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:14
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joshua 1:17 (id: 19317)

Israel often did not obey … Moses. However, the tribes living east of the Jordan did cross with the rest of Israel, and they did not return to their own land and homes until Joshua dismissed them ([22:6](https://ref.ly/Josh22:6)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:17
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joshua 1:18 (id: 19318)

Disobeying God’s chosen ruler was treason against God himself.

## Joshua 2:1 (id: 19464)

Acacia Grove was about eight miles east of the Jordan River on the plains of Moab, across from Jericho (see[Num 25:1](https://ref.ly/Num25:1)). • In the house of a prostitute strangers could avoid unwanted attention. According to tradition, Rahab was an innkeeper as well as a prostitute (Josephus, *Antiquities* 5\.1\.2\). Other evidence from the ancient Near East suggests that women who owned and operated inns were often prostitutes.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 2:1
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joshua 2:1–24 (id: 19457)

Like any good military commander, Joshua sent out spies or scouts to get information about his objective. • Because Israel planned to approach Canaan from the east, they could not bypass Jericho.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 2:1–JOS 2:24
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joshua 2:2 (id: 19466)

The spies’ speech probably gave them away. Hebrew and Canaanite were both dialects of the same language but with differences in vocabulary and grammar.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 2:2
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joshua 2:3 (id: 19467)

Jericho’s king assumed Rahab was both loyal to the city and unaware of the men’s mission.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 2:3
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joshua 2:4–5 (id: 19468)

It is not necessary either to condone or condemn Rahab’s lying to the king’s messengers. She might have had no concept of any ethical standards God had given Israel. Or the higher ethical value of saving lives might supersede the normal requirement to be truthful.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 2:4–JOS 2:5
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joshua 2:6 (id: 19469)

The inner fibers of flax were processed to make linen. The first step involved laying out the flax stems to dry on the flat rooftop.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 2:6
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joshua 2:7 (id: 19470)

Medium\-sized towns such as Jericho had one main gate made of two very large wooden doors reinforced with bronze. The gate was barred for the night and opened again in the morning. By shutting the gate immediately after the pursuers departed, the authorities took a sensible precaution: If the spies had not left the town as Rahab implied, they might still be found in Jericho during the night.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 2:7
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joshua 2:9–10 (id: 19471)

Rahab began to declare her faith in the Lord. • made a dry path: God had parted the waters of the Red Sea for Israel ([Exod 14:21–28](https://ref.ly/Exod14:21-Exod14:28)). • Israel had defeated Sihon and Og ([Num 21:21–35](https://ref.ly/Num21:21-Num21:35)). • completely destroyed: See [Lev 27:28–29](https://ref.ly/Lev27:28-Lev27:29); [1 Sam 15:3](https://ref.ly/1Sam15:3).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 2:9–JOS 2:10
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joshua 2:11 (id: 19458)

Although the people of Canaan incurred God’s judgment, Rahab’s declaration of faith (proven genuine by her aid to the spies) brought her into the people of God ([Heb 11:31](https://ref.ly/Heb11:31)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 2:11
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joshua 2:12–13 (id: 19459)

Rahab’s request demonstrated her faith in Israel and Israel’s God.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 2:12–JOS 2:13
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joshua 2:14 (id: 19460)

When Israel attacked Jericho, Joshua and the two spies kept their promise to spare Rahab ([6:22](https://ref.ly/Josh6:22)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 2:14
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joshua 2:15 (id: 19461)

Because Rahab’s house stood on the town wall, she could hide the men on the flat roof of her house ([2:6](https://ref.ly/Josh2:6)) and let them out through the window, down the outer side of the wall.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 2:15
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joshua 2:16 (id: 19462)

The hill country of central Canaan began its steep rise just west of Jericho. Thinking that the two spies would head directly to Israel’s camp across the Jordan, the pursuers from Jericho would naturally head eastward. When the pursuers gave up, the spies could slip across the Jordan unhindered.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 2:16
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joshua 2:19 (id: 19463)

it will not be our fault. But … we will accept the responsibility: The spies used a standard formula to accept responsibility for any of Rahab’s family remaining with her in her house, but not for those who did not.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 2:19
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joshua 2:23–24 (id: 19465)

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 3:1
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joshua 3:3 (id: 19566)

The Ark of the Covenant of the Lord was God’s dwelling place among the Israelites and symbolized his throne. Whenever Israel moved, a contingent of priests carried the Ark before them ([Exod 25:13–15](https://ref.ly/Exod25:13-Exod25:15); [Num 10:33–36](https://ref.ly/Num10:33-Num10:36)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 3:4
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joshua 3:5 (id: 19568)

Purify yourselves: They had to separate themselves from anything unclean that would bar an Israelite from coming into God’s presence (cp. [Exod 19:9–20](https://ref.ly/Exod19:9-Exod19:20); [Lev 11:44](https://ref.ly/Lev11:44)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 3:5
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joshua 3:7 (id: 19569)

To reassure the people that he had not brought them this far to abandon them, God made Joshua a great leader like Moses.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 3:7
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joshua 3:8 (id: 19570)

As they crossed the Jordan River, the Ark led the way until the feet of the priests entered the water; the priests were to stand in the Jordan, not on the dry land. By carrying the Ark into the water first, the obedient priests would show their faith (cp. [Jas 2:18](https://ref.ly/Jas2:18)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 3:8
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joshua 3:10 (id: 19558)

Today you will know: The Israelites who were adults when Moses led Israel out of Egypt had died. The people now entering Canaan with Joshua had taken their place. The events about to unfold would signify God’s presence with them and demonstrate his intention to fulfill his promises. • In Canaan, the Israelites would be living among pagan neighbors and might be tempted to join them in worshiping their gods and goddesses. None of these false gods were worthy of worship. By contrast, the Lord is the living God, and he was present among the Israelites. • The Canaanites and Amorites were distinct peoples, but their names sometimes indicated all the pre\-Israelite peoples of Canaan. The Hittites were related to the earlier Hittite Empire of Asia Minor that controlled much of Canaan. The Jebusites were from the city\-state of Jerusalem, which Israel did not conquer fully until David’s time. Little is known about the other three groups.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 3:10
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joshua 3:11 (id: 19559)

Because the Ark of the Covenant went ahead of the Israelites, they knew that the Lord of the whole earth was leading them into Canaan. Their God was not a limited local deity.

## Joshua 3:12 (id: 19560)

Even though the Jordan was in its spring flood stage, the water stopped abruptly, an obvious miracle.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 3:13
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joshua 3:15 (id: 19562)

The Jordan was overflowing its banks as a result of the spring runoff of the winter’s rainfall and snowfall, especially from Mount Hermon.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 3:15
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joshua 3:16 (id: 19563)

Two wonders occurred. First, the water … began backing up above Adam (about twenty\-five miles away). Second, the entire bed of the river was dry, as remaining water drained to the Dead Sea.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 3:16

The repetition of the phrase on dry ground emphasizes that God performed a miracle.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 3:17
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joshua 4:2 (id: 19575)

The twelve men represented Jacob’s twelve sons. The tribe of Levi was not counted because the Levites settled in designated cities among the other tribes ([Gen 49:5–7](https://ref.ly/Gen49:5-Gen49:7); [Num 1:49–52](https://ref.ly/Num1:49-Num1:52); [18:20](https://ref.ly/Num18:20)). However, the number of tribes remained at twelve because Joseph’s two sons (Ephraim and Manasseh) were accounted as separate tribes ([Gen 48:5](https://ref.ly/Gen48:5)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 4:2

Joshua twice ([4:21](https://ref.ly/Josh4:21)) told the Israelites to prepare to answer future generations. The stone memorial would serve as a teaching aid.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 4:6
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joshua 4:9 (id: 19578)

A second memorial of twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan was submerged as soon as the river resumed its flow. The monument’s top would be visible in the dry summer seasons. • Their existence to this day indicates that the memorials stood for generations, until the final editing of the book (see Joshua Book Introduction, “Author and Date”).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 4:9
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joshua 4:14 (id: 19571)

Now that God had brought the Israelites safely across the Jordan River, Israel recognized God’s presence with Joshua as a great leader and revered him as much as they had revered Moses. Their confidence in Joshua would be crucial in the years ahead.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 4:14

## Joshua 4:19–20 (id: 19573)

The tenth day of the first month occurred a few days before Passover. • Gilgal became an important worship center for early Israel. Although its location is uncertain, it was somewhere just east or northeast of Jericho. Its name (which means “wheel of a cart,” cp. [Isa 28:28](https://ref.ly/Isa28:28)) implies that Joshua set the twelve stones in a circle (cp. study note on Josh 5:9).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 4:19–JOS 4:20
* **Associated Articles:** Joshua 5:9 (ID: 19592)

## Joshua 4:24 (id: 19574)

In addition to future generations of Israelites, all the nations of the earth were to understand God’s power. At least some individuals in every group respond to the God who cares for them ([Rev 7:9–10](https://ref.ly/Rev7:9-Rev7:10)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 4:24
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joshua 5:1 (id: 19587)

After news of Israel’s crossing of the Jordan River spread, all of southern Canaan was in a state of alert awaiting Israel’s expected invasion. • With Israel’s impossible crossing of the Jordan, the Canaanites lost heart and were paralyzed with fear. They knew they faced the people of a God more powerful than any they worshiped.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 5:1
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joshua 5:2 (id: 19588)

Before the Israelites turned their attention to Jericho, God directed Joshua to perform the covenant renewal ceremony of circumcising all the males born in the forty years since the exodus from Egypt. Because the land was part of the covenant promise, Israel’s men needed to demonstrate their personal participation in the covenant through circumcision in order to enter into the land. • Flint is found in a natural state, so flint knives were mandated for circumcision as a symbol of purity or holiness.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 5:2
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joshua 5:3 (id: 19589)

The name Gibeath\-haaraloth (“hill of foreskins”) suggests that the circumcision ritual took place on a hill outside Israel’s camp at Gilgal.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 5:3
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joshua 5:4–7 (id: 19590)

This unexpected detour in the narrative provides an important reminder of Israel’s earlier refusal to believe that God would bring them safely into the land of Canaan ([Num 14](https://ref.ly/Num14:1-Num14:45)). This summary of God’s judgment upon their fathers reminded the present generation that trusting in God was still necessary if they were to occupy the land their ancestors had forfeited. Further, it signaled the completion of God’s judgment upon the earlier generation.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 5:4–JOS 5:7
* **Associated Articles:**

until they were healed: Recovery from circumcision, a relatively minor surgery, usually takes about three days if no complications occur.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 5:8

## Joshua 5:9 (id: 19592)

Gilgal sounds like the Hebrew word galal (“to roll”)—this place was where God rolled away the reproach of Egypt.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 5:9
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joshua 5:10 (id: 19579)

The Passover lamb was slain on the evening of the fourteenth day of the first month. Just as the Passover in Egypt marked the exodus from slavery, the celebration of this Passover in Canaan marked the attainment of the goal God had been leading the Israelites toward. This Passover also anticipated God’s promised rest for his people in their new land. • This was apparently the first Passover Israel had celebrated since they had been encamped at Sinai ([Num 9:1–5](https://ref.ly/Num9:1-Num9:5)). For the younger Israelites, it was their first Passover ever; for the older ones, their first since childhood. Celebrating the Passover after such a long lapse, particularly on the eve of the campaign to take the Promised Land, heightened both the joy and the solemnity of the occasion.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 5:10
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joshua 5:11 (id: 19581)

Israel reinstituted the Festival of Unleavened Bread, observed for seven days following Passover ([Lev 23:6](https://ref.ly/Lev23:6)). The people ate unleavened bread and roasted grain, a favorite food of the harvest season (see [Ruth 2:14](https://ref.ly/Ruth2:14)).

God’s daily provision of manna ([Exod 16:31](https://ref.ly/Exod16:31); [Num 11:9](https://ref.ly/Num11:9)) could cease because the produce from the land was now available.

Joshua was scouting the land and the city’s defenses near the town of Jericho to follow up on the report of the two spies ([2:23–24](https://ref.ly/Josh2:23-Josh2:24)). Joshua demonstrated personal courage when he approached the unknown figure whose sword was already drawn.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 5:13
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joshua 5:13–15 (id: 19583)

The commander of the Lord’s army gave Joshua instructions for conducting the siege of Jericho ([6:2–5](https://ref.ly/Josh6:2-Josh6:5)). Like God’s earlier message to Joshua ([1:1–9](https://ref.ly/Josh1:1-Josh1:9)), this encounter was to encourage Joshua on the eve of action against the enemy.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 5:13–JOS 5:15
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joshua 5:14 (id: 19585)

Joshua fell with his face to the ground in reverence when he understood who stood before him. Joshua’s action demonstrated that he was available for God’s service, wholeheartedly and without reservation. • Scholars disagree whether the commander was an appearance of God, the pre\-incarnate Christ, or an angel. His reference to himself as commander of the Lord’s army might imply that he was an angel. However, he did not prevent Joshua from worshiping him, as angels usually did (e.g., [Rev 22:8–9](https://ref.ly/Rev22:8-Rev22:9); cp. [Acts 10:25–26](https://ref.ly/Acts10:25-Acts10:26)).

Take off your sandals, for the place … is holy: This was what God told Moses at the burning bush ([Exod 3:5](https://ref.ly/Exod3:5)). Joshua certainly recognized the similarity. This encounter would have encouraged Joshua of God’s blessing on Israel’s first action against Canaan.

## Joshua 6:1 (id: 19597)

Jericho guarded two important entrances into the heart of the hill country. If the Israelites did not conquer the city first, they would leave a well\-armed enemy at their back, standing between the Israelite forces and their families encamped at Gilgal. They had to conquer Jericho first.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 6:1

## Joshua 6:4 (id: 19606)

Seven is a biblical number of perfection. • The seven priests were to precede the Ark*,* the emblem of God’s presence, at the head of Israel’s forces. This arrangement symbolized that God himself fought against the town. Israel had only to march and observe, then shout and observe, and finally mop up after God delivered the town into their hands. • The ram’s horn (Hebrew shofar) could sound several pitches to signal either battle or worship. In battle, the shofar alerted troops or townsfolk to an enemy’s approach or sounded the call to advance or retreat.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 6:4
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joshua 6:6–9 (id: 19607)

The Ark, the priests blowing the horns, and the military honor guard all symbolized God’s presence and his leadership of the siege.

Joshua placed a curse upon the site because Jericho was the first Canaanite town to resist God’s purposes in bringing Israel into the land. Jericho was also the first town to experience God’s judgment upon Canaan’s great wickedness. As the firstfruits of Israel’s conquest of Canaan, it belonged to God ([Exod 13:2](https://ref.ly/Exod13:2); [23:19](https://ref.ly/Exod23:19)).

Adoni\-zedek means “master of righteousness” or “my master is righteous.” An earlier king of Jerusalem named Melchizedek (“king of righteousness” or “my king is righteous”) had been “a priest of God Most High” and a friend of Abraham ([Gen 14:18–20](https://ref.ly/Gen14:18-Gen14:20)). However, Adoni\-zedek was not a friend to Joshua or a believer in the Lord.

Gibeon and its neighboring cities occupied a plateau north of Jerusalem (see study note on 7:2). With Gibeon now allied to Israel, control of the plateau and of the central hill country in the vicinity of Gibeon belonged to Israel. Throughout history, whoever has controlled the plateau has, in general, also controlled the hill country. The Canaanite kings had to conquer Gibeon or their cause was lost.

Joshua’s army walked all night to travel the fifteen miles up the rugged passes and steep slopes and across the plateau. By attacking the Amorite armies from the east at sunrise, Joshua’s army came out of the sun, blinding the Amorites as they faced eastward to fight. • Israel’s covenant required the nation to respond to Gibeon’s plea for help, but Joshua responded more promptly than any treaty required.

Hazor lay along the international trade route and was by far the largest and most important inland city of Canaan (see [11:10](https://ref.ly/Josh11:10)). • Virtually all of northern Canaan joined the coalition of King Jabin against Israel. This region stretched from the Mediterranean Sea in the west to the desert in the east and from the borders of Phoenicia in the north to the hill country and the Jordan Valley in the south. • The term Jebusites typically refers to the people of Jerusalem and surrounding towns under its control.

As he had promised, God brought Israel into the land.

Because God owned the land, the apportionment to the tribes was a gift. God gave them the land to dwell in and directed its distribution. • In these lists of tribal allotments, the author describes some borders in such detail that they can be plotted on a map while others were far less well defined.

The Canaanites living in and near it and the valley of Beth\-shan restricted Manasseh’s expansion and apparently Ephraim’s as well.

Rather than rebuke the people for their fear, Joshua repeated his instructions to clear forest land for settlement. His promise that the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh would eventually drive out the Canaanites gave them a hope by which they could enlarge their faith and conquer their fear. • Much of the hill country was forested, and Canaanite settlement was sparse there. If Ephraim and Manasseh had contented themselves with land already cleared, they would have had little room for settlement. With the introduction of iron technology at about this time, including iron axe heads, the people of these tribes could clear the virgin forests and open up new land for settlement. Joshua might have set an example by being the first to clear his own homestead at Timnath\-serah ([19:50](https://ref.ly/Josh19:50)), a forested region in the Ephraimite hill country.

The sin at Peor was Israel’s idolatrous rebellion in Moab, just at the point of entering the Promised Land ([Num 25](https://ref.ly/Num25:1-Num25:18)).

## Joshua 22:19 (id: 19497)

Being defiled was not necessarily the result of rebellion or a moral lapse, but it did prevent persons or groups from participating in regular worship activities, including the offering of sacrifices. If the eastern tribes had defiled the land itself, the Israelites could not offer sacrifices to the Lord within it. This concern provides evidence that the eastern tribes had built their altar on the western bank of the Jordan. • The land west of the Jordan was considered the Lord’s land. The delegation from the western tribes made a very generous offer, inviting the eastern tribes to share their land. This demonstrated their commitment to national unity in faithfulness to God.

Some of the land that Joshua had assigned to the various tribes remained unconquered. Israel’s gradual occupation of the land had an ecological reason (see [Exod 23:29–30](https://ref.ly/Exod23:29-Exod23:30)), a military reason (see [Judg 1:19](https://ref.ly/Judg1:19)), and a theological reason (see[Judg 2:20–3:4](https://ref.ly/Judg2:20-Judg3:4)). Israel’s ensuing unfaithfulness delayed the settlement process by several centuries; instead of driving out the remaining Canaanites, Israel absorbed them, bringing God’s people even greater temptations to unfaithfulness. Joshua knew this to be a real danger ([Josh 23:15–16](https://ref.ly/Josh23:15-Josh23:16)).

Joshua warned God’s people not to intermarry with their polytheistic neighbors because such an intimate relationship would lead the Israelites astray ([Deut 7:3–4](https://ref.ly/Deut7:3-Deut7:4)). However, Canaanites who desired to worship the Lord and join God’s people were welcomed ([Josh 6:25](https://ref.ly/Josh6:25); [Ruth 4:10](https://ref.ly/Ruth4:10)). Race, language, and ethnicity had no bearing on God’s prohibition of intermarriage; it was a matter of faithfulness to the Lord (cp.[2 Cor 6:14–15](https://ref.ly/2Cor6:14-2Cor6:15)).

Apostasy—turning away from the true God—is fatal. • Because God is holy, Joshua could speak with optimism regarding God’s promises and the good land into which God had brought them.
