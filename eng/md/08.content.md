## Ruth 1:6 (id: 25794)

The Hebrew verb for "giving" is also used in [Ruth 4:13](https://ref.ly/Ruth4:13) as “enabled.” These two mentions of God's actions frame the story with similar phrases, known as an *inclusio* or literary “bookends.” God provides good things, like food and children, and he works behind the scenes in everyday life.

* **Associated Passages:** RUT 1:6

## Ruth 1:8 (id: 25795)

* **Associated Passages:** RUT 1:9

## Ruth 1:14 (id: 25785)

*Ruth clung to her*: The Hebrew verb here shows how strong Ruth’s love was for her mother\-in\-law. It is the same word used to describe a man being "joined to" his wife ([Genesis 2:24](https://ref.ly/Gen2:24)) and to describe a person staying faithful to the Lord ([Deuteronomy 4:4](https://ref.ly/Deut4:4); [10:20](https://ref.ly/Deut10:20); [Joshua 22:5](https://ref.ly/Josh22:5)).

* **Associated Passages:** RUT 1:16–RUT 1:17

## Ruth 1:20 (id: 25789)

Almighty translates the Hebrew word *shadday*, which shows God's strength and provision. Naomi's complaint was genuine, but God gave her exactly what she needed (see [Ruth 4:14–17](https://ref.ly/Ruth4:14-Ruth4:17)).

* **Associated Passages:** RUT 1:20

## Ruth 1:22 (id: 25790)

The barley harvest began between late March and mid\-April on our calendar.

* **Associated Passages:** RUT 2:1
* **Associated Articles:** Ruth 2:20 (ID: `25803@TyndaleStudyNotes`)

## Ruth 2:2 (id: 25805)

*glean heads of grain*: Harvesters were to leave some grain for the poor to gather (see [Leviticus 19:9–10](https://ref.ly/Lev19:9-Lev19:10); [23:22](https://ref.ly/Lev23:22); [Deuteronomy 24:19–22](https://ref.ly/Deut24:19-Deut24:22)). God ensured the poor had food.

* **Associated Passages:** RUT 2:2

## Ruth 2:3 (id: 25806)

*she happened to come to*: Ruth chose a field seemingly at random to gather leftover grain. God uses ordinary choices to help those who trust him.

Boaz saw Ruth as a young woman suitable for marriage (Hebrew *na‘arah*).

* **Associated Passages:** RUT 2:5

## Ruth 2:7 (id: 25808)

*in the shelter*: Many farmers in Israel's hill country built shelters next to their fields for the harvest. Workers used these shelters for shade during lunch or other breaks in the long, hard workday. You can still see these shelters in parts of the hill country.

* **Associated Passages:** RUT 2:7

## Ruth 2:8–9 (id: 25809)

* Boaz gave Ruth the special privilege of gleaning right behind the young women. After the men cut the grain and tied it in small bundles, the women gathered the bundles into larger sheaves. The Torah did not require farmers to allow gleaners into the fields until they took the sheaves to the threshing floor.
* *I have ordered the young men not to touch you*: Boaz assured Ruth that no one under his authority would taunt her or try to drive her away from his fields, even though she was there before the proper time for gleaners.
* *go and drink from the jars*: Boaz’s generosity saved Ruth the trouble of drawing her own water.

* **Associated Passages:** RUT 2:8–RUT 2:9

## Ruth 2:13 (id: 25797)

*your maidservant*: By using this term, Ruth showed she was lower in status than Boaz’s servants.

* **Associated Passages:** RUT 2:13

Boaz showed great hospitality by sharing his meal with Ruth, going above and beyond what was expected.

* **Associated Passages:** RUT 2:14

## Ruth 2:15–16 (id: 25799)

Boaz's instructions to his workers after lunch made Ruth's gleaning much more productive. Boaz gave Ruth more than the gleaning law required.

* **Associated Passages:** RUT 2:15–RUT 2:16

## Ruth 2:18 (id: 25800)

Ruth was careful and generous when she gave Naomi the leftover roasted grain.

* **Associated Passages:** RUT 2:18

## Ruth 2:19 (id: 25801)

*glean*: Ruth usually could not gather as much as an ephah of barley, which is about two\-thirds of a bushel.

* **Associated Passages:** RUT 2:19

## Ruth 2:20 (id: 25803)

*kinsman\-redeemer**s* (Hebrew *go’el*): The law required the *go’el*, the closest male relative, to assist a family member facing financial difficulties (see “The Family Redeemer” Theme Note; see also study note on Leviticus 25:25).

* **Associated Passages:** RUT 2:20
* **Associated Articles:** Leviticus 25:25 (ID: `20280@TyndaleStudyNotes`); The Family Redeemer (ID: `500206@TyndaleStudyNotesThemes`)

## Ruth 2:21 (id: 25804)

The author calls Ruth "Ruth the Moabite" five times ([Ruth 1:22](https://ref.ly/Ruth1:22); [2:2](https://ref.ly/Ruth2:2), [21](https://ref.ly/Ruth2:21); [4:5](https://ref.ly/Ruth4:5), [10](https://ref.ly/Ruth4:10)). This reminds us that Ruth was not an Israelite.

* **Associated Passages:** RUT 2:21

## Ruth 3:1 (id: 25814)

*a resting place*: Naomi used a similar word in [Ruth 1:9](https://ref.ly/Ruth1:9) when she prayed for Ruth and Orpah. Now she suggested a plan that might encourage Boaz to help Ruth.

* **Associated Passages:** RUT 3:1

## Ruth 3:2 (id: 25815)

* As a close relative, Boaz might serve as a redeemer for Ruth and Naomi (see study notes on Ruth 2:20; 3:9).
* The threshing floor was a flat surface made of stone or hardened earth. The farmer spread sheaves of grain over it and beat them to separate the grain from the straw. Then the farmer would winnow by tossing the mixed straw and grain into the air with a wooden fork or shovel. The breeze carried the lighter straw and chaff away, while the heavier grains fell back to the threshing floor.

* **Associated Passages:** RUT 3:2
* **Associated Articles:** Ruth 2:20 (ID: `25803@TyndaleStudyNotes`); Ruth 3:9 (ID: `25820@TyndaleStudyNotes`)

## Ruth 3:3 (id: 25816)

*wash yourself*: Ruth likely washed herself with a cloth dipped in water. Only wealthy people had facilities for full immersion. Bathing was not a daily routine; it was for special occasions.

* **Associated Passages:** RUT 3:3

## Ruth 3:4 (id: 25817)

Ruth uncovered Boaz's feet to wake him up.

* **Associated Passages:** RUT 3:4

## Ruth 3:7 (id: 25818)

*he went to lie down*: The owner slept at the threshing floor to prevent small thefts.

* **Associated Passages:** RUT 3:7

## Ruth 3:8 (id: 25819)

*was startled* (literally *He was terrified*): Boaz realized a woman was at his feet, but he did not know her identity or reason for being there.

* **Associated Passages:** RUT 3:8

## Ruth 3:9 (id: 25820)

* *your servant*: Ruth intentionally identified herself with the female workers.
* *Spread the corner of your garment over me*: This was Ruth's way of asking Boaz to marry her (compare [Ezekiel 16:8](https://ref.ly/Ezek16:8)).
* Ruth appealed to Boaz’s role as a family redeemer (Hebrew *go’el*) to convince him to marry her (see [Ruth 4:5](https://ref.ly/Ruth4:5); “The Family Redeemer” Theme Note).

* **Associated Passages:** RUT 3:9
* **Associated Articles:** The Family Redeemer (ID: `500206@TyndaleStudyNotesThemes`)

## Ruth 3:10 (id: 25810)

*You have shown more kindness*: Ruth did not have to go to Bethlehem with Naomi. She was not required to marry into Elimelech’s family or give them an heir to the land (see [Ruth 4:5](https://ref.ly/Ruth4:5)).

* **Associated Passages:** RUT 3:10

## Ruth 3:11 (id: 25811)

*whatever you request*: Boaz agreed to help Ruth. Some interpreters see Boaz's statement as a promise to marry Ruth (see also study note on Ruth 4:5). Most believe it means Boaz would help Ruth and Naomi by giving the closer relative the chance to act as family redeemer before he did ([Ruth 4:1–12](https://ref.ly/Ruth4:1-Ruth4:12)). By choosing to be the family redeemer for Ruth and Naomi, Boaz became a precursor to Jesus.

* **Associated Passages:** RUT 3:11
* **Associated Articles:** Ruth 4:5 (ID: `25831@TyndaleStudyNotes`)

## Ruth 3:12–13 (id: 25812)

Another man was more closely related to Elimelech than Boaz. He had the first right to act as the family redeemer and, according to most interpreters, to marry Ruth.

* **Associated Passages:** RUT 3:12–RUT 3:13

## Ruth 3:15 (id: 25813)

*six measures*: There were two scoop sizes. The smaller measure, the *omer*, was one\-tenth of an *ephah* (about eight cups or two quarts). The larger measure, the *seah*, was one\-third of an *ephah* (about 26 2/3 cups or around seven quarts). The larger amount is more likely and shows a very generous gift, twice what Ruth gathered on her first day ([Ruth 2:17](https://ref.ly/Ruth2:17)). It was a significant sign of good faith.

* **Associated Passages:** RUT 3:15

## Ruth 4:1 (id: 25828)

* Most legal transactions, like property transfers, happened at the town gate.
* *friend*: Boaz may have used the man's name, but the author of Ruth did not.

* **Associated Passages:** RUT 4:1

## Ruth 4:3 (id: 25829)

*Naomi...is selling the piece of land*: Naomi likely did not control Elimelech’s ancestral land, but she had legal ownership. She was selling the right to redeem, or buy back, the land from its current user.

* **Associated Passages:** RUT 4:3

## Ruth 4:4 (id: 25830)

* *redeem it*: The law required a close relative, known as the family redeemer, to buy land when a landowner needed to sell it (see [Leviticus 25:23–34](https://ref.ly/Lev25:23-Lev25:34)). This practice kept land within the family. The redeemer acted as a caretaker for the land until the struggling landowner could recover financially and buy it back.
* *I will redeem it*: The relative saw a great opportunity—there was no male heir and no sign there would be one. He could add the land to his own estate while fulfilling his family duty.

* **Associated Passages:** RUT 4:4

## Ruth 4:5 (id: 25831)

*On the day you buy the land...you must also acquire the widow of the deceased*: In Hebrew manuscripts, the verse reads *I buy*, but a scribal correction in the margin reads *you buy*, differing by one letter. The scribe believed *you buy* was the original text, suggesting an error in the main text. Some think *I buy* is the original, indicating Boaz and Ruth's marriage was already planned (see study note on Judges 3:11). However, most translators believe *you buy* is original because: 

1. The scribe thought *you buy* was correct
2. Most ancient translations of Ruth which are older than our Hebrew copies, also read *you buy*
3. An earlier scribe might have mistakenly used *I have acquired* from [Ruth 4:10](https://ref.ly/Ruth4:10) instead of *you buy*

This ensures Ruth can have children to continue her husband's name and keep the land in the family, drawing from [Deuteronomy 25:7](https://ref.ly/Deut25:7). Boaz linked the duties of a family redeemer (see study notes Ruth 2:20; Leviticus 25:25) with those of a brother\-in\-law (Latin "*levir*") to provide an heir for a deceased brother (see [Deuteronomy 25:5–10](https://ref.ly/Deut25:5-Deut25:10) for levirate marriage; compare [Genesis 38](https://ref.ly/Gen38:1-Gen38:30)). There is no exact precedent for Boaz's legal action. The duty of the "*levir*" in [Deuteronomy 25:5–10](https://ref.ly/Deut25:5-Deut25:10) did not apply here, as neither Boaz nor the other kinsman was Elimelech’s brother, and Ruth was not Elimelech’s widow. Boaz used the spirit of the law about the *go’el* (family redeemer) to create a moral, if not legal, duty to act as "*levir*" and provide an heir to inherit the land (see study note on Leviticus 25:25). Land ownership and providing an heir were closely linked in ancient Israel (compare [Numbers 27:1–11\)](https://ref.ly/Num27:1-Num27:11). Since Naomi was too old to have children, Ruth, Elimelech’s son's widow, would be the mother of such an heir. This move surprised the other kinsman ([Ruth 4:6](https://ref.ly/Ruth4:6)), but Boaz's argument, though perhaps new, was accepted as valid.

## Ruth 4:6 (id: 25832)

* *I cannot redeem it myself*: Adding Ruth to the deal changed everything for the other relative.
* *I would jeopardize my own inheritance*: If he bought the land, married Ruth, and raised an heir for Elimelech, he might invest many resources only to lose control of the new land. He might not have enough to maintain his own land. If he failed to have a second son with Ruth as his own heir, his land would go to Elimelech’s heir, and his own name would disappear. Even if this relative acquired the land without Ruth (see study notes on Ruth 3:11; 4:5), he might still lose his investment to Ruth's heir. By trying to protect his own name, this man became the nameless one who refused to help his close relative.

## Ruth 4:7 (id: 25833)

*in former times*: The Book of Ruth was not written right after the events happened. By the time it was written, most people had forgotten the custom of removing a sandal and its meaning. The transfer of a sandal symbolized transferring the right to buy and redeem land. See also [Deuteronomy 25:9](https://ref.ly/Deut25:9) for a similar, but not identical, custom related to levirate marriage. In both cases, the sandal signified the right of redemption.

* **Associated Passages:** RUT 4:7

## Ruth 4:10 (id: 25821)

*Moreover*: Boaz planned to have a child for Mahlon, the first son. This child would continue the family name of her deceased husband and inherit his land.

* **Associated Passages:** RUT 4:10

## Ruth 4:11 (id: 25822)

* Rachel and Leah, Jacob’s two wives, were the mothers of Israel.
* *Ephrathah*: See study note on Ruth 1:2.

* **Associated Passages:** RUT 4:11
* **Associated Articles:** Ruth 1:2 (ID: `25791@TyndaleStudyNotes`)

## Ruth 4:12 (id: 25823)

Like Ruth, Tamar was a foreigner. She became the mother of Perez and Zerah, who were ancestors of Judah's descendants.

* **Associated Passages:** RUT 4:12

## Ruth 4:13 (id: 25824)

*the LORD enabled her*: See study note on Ruth 1:6.

* **Associated Passages:** RUT 4:13
* **Associated Articles:** Ruth 1:6 (ID: `25794@TyndaleStudyNotes`)

## Ruth 4:14 (id: 25825)

This child became the family Naomi lost when her two sons died in Moab. The town's women saw that this child completed Naomi's redemption.

* **Associated Passages:** RUT 4:14

## Ruth 4:15 (id: 25826)

*sustain you in your old age* (literally *cause your old age to be full*): With Obed's birth, Naomi's life became full again (compare [Ruth 1:21](https://ref.ly/Ruth1:21)).

* **Associated Passages:** RUT 4:15

## Ruth 4:18–22 (id: 25827)

The book of Ruth ends with a genealogy of ten generations, from Perez, the son of Judah (Jacob’s son), to David, the grandson of Obed. This story is not only one of the world's great tales but also details the family history of David, Israel’s greatest king. The fact that Ruth and Boaz were ancestors of Israel’s greatest king is a major reason for including this small book in the Old Testament.
