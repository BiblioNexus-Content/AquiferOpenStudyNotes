## Joel 1:1 (id: 18732)

TheThe word of the Lord gave this message (literally *The word of the* Lord *came*): The Lord, not the human prophet, was the ultimate source of these words. • The name Joel means “the Lord \[Yahweh] is God.” Joel’s father, Pethuel*,* is unknown apart from this verse.

* **Associated Passages:** JOL 1:3
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joel 1:4 (id: 18736)

The disaster that had befallen Judah was a catastrophic plague of locusts. Some commentators have understood the four kinds of *locusts* mentioned here to represent four ancient empires that conquered Israel. Others have suggested that the words indicate four stages in the development of locusts. Most likely, the prophet was using multiple terms to emphasize the extent of the destruction wrought by wave after wave of the voracious insects.

* **Associated Passages:** JOL 1:4

## Joel 1:5 (id: 18737)

Wake up … Wail: The prophet sought to arouse the people and alert them to the gravity of the locust plague.

## Joel 1:7 (id: 18738)

The destructive power of locusts is well documented in both ancient and modern times. The insatiable insects consume annual crops such as grains and vegetables, and they destroy perennial fruit\-bearing trees and vines, leaving the branches white and bare.

The locust plague threatened the people of Judah with starvation and brought the regular daily animal sacrifices and offerings of grain and wine at the Temple in Jerusalem to a halt (cp. [Exod 29:38–41](https://ref.ly/Exod29:38-Exod29:41); [Num 28:2–8](https://ref.ly/Num28:2-Num28:8)).

The locusts destroyed the three essential staple crops of ancient Israel: grain … grapes and olive oil.

* **Associated Passages:** JOL 1:10

## Joel 1:12 (id: 18726)

Drought had intensified the devastation of the locust plague; everything had withered and dried up (see also [1:19–20](https://ref.ly/Joel1:19-Joel1:20)). Spiritually, the people’s joy had dried up along with the fruit trees.

* **Associated Passages:** JOL 1:12
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joel 1:13–14 (id: 18727)

The priests were to lead all the people in public rites of mourning at the Temple. Their outward actions must be matched by authentic inward change (see [2:13](https://ref.ly/Joel2:13)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOL 1:13–JOL 1:14
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joel 1:15 (id: 18728)

The locust plague was not simply a natural event, but a sign that the day of the Lord was near. Beginning with Amos in the 700s BC ([Amos 5:18](https://ref.ly/Amos5:18)), the prophets had spoken of a future time when God would intervene in human history to judge the wicked and vindicate the righteous. • destruction … from the Almighty: The Hebrew text highlights the similar sounds of the word *destruction* (shod) and the title *the Almighty* (shadday).

* **Associated Passages:** JOL 1:17
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joel 1:18 (id: 18730)

The inhabitants of Judah were hard pressed by the famine; even sheep and goats*,* animals that can live on very meager forage, bleat in misery for lack of food.

* **Associated Passages:** JOL 1:18
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joel 1:19 (id: 18731)

Lord, help us! (literally *to you,* Lord*, I cry*): Joel responded to the plague with an earnest prayer. The people’s only recourse was to turn to the sovereign Lord of heaven and earth and appeal to his goodness; he alone could reverse their desperate situation.

* **Associated Passages:** JOL 1:19
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joel 1:20 (id: 18733)

All creation suffers because of human sin ([Gen 3:17–18](https://ref.ly/Gen3:17-Gen3:18); [9:2](https://ref.ly/Gen9:2); [Rom 8:20–21](https://ref.ly/Rom8:20-Rom8:21))—even the wild animals cry out to God. The Hebrew word translated “cry out” is the same word used in [Ps 42:1](https://ref.ly/Ps42:1) of the deer that “longs” for streams of water. The beasts, urgently requiring their food and drink, set an example of how the people of Judah and Jerusalem should seek their Lord (cp. [Isa 1:3](https://ref.ly/Isa1:3)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOL 1:20
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joel 2:1 (id: 18755)

When an ancient city was attacked, the watchmen on the city wall would raise the alarm by blowing the trumpet, a ram’s horn instrument called a shofar (see also [2:15](https://ref.ly/Joel2:15)), to call all the defenders to repel the enemy.

* **Associated Passages:** JOL 2:1
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joel 2:1–11 (id: 18741)

Some regard this section as a second account of the locust plague described in ch [1](https://ref.ly/Joel1:1-Joel1:20), but in ch [1](https://ref.ly/Joel1:1-Joel1:20), the plague is in the past, whereas in this section, the verb tenses seem to depict it as a future event. Thus, others see it as a warning of yet another locust plague. Still other commentators have understood this passage as an apocalyptic description of the coming day of the Lord*,* using the language of a locust plague to describe an invading human army.

* **Associated Passages:** JOL 2:1–JOL 2:11
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joel 2:2 (id: 18763)

Some religious leaders had taught the people of Jerusalem and Judah that the day of the Lord would be a time of blessing for God’s people. Echoing the prophet Zephaniah ([Zeph 1:15](https://ref.ly/Zeph1:15)), Joel proclaimed that it would instead be a day of darkness and gloom (see also [Amos 5:18–20](https://ref.ly/Amos5:18-Amos5:20)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOL 2:2
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joel 2:3 (id: 18766)

The destruction wrought by the invading army would be like a raging wildfire. Before the attack, the land looked like the Garden of Eden*,* but afterwards, it would be nothing but desolation (a reversal of [Isa 51:3](https://ref.ly/Isa51:3) and [Ezek 36:35](https://ref.ly/Ezek36:35)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOL 2:3
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joel 2:4–5 (id: 18767)

They look like horses: The resemblance between locusts and horses (see also [Rev 9:7](https://ref.ly/Rev9:7)) heightens the image of the locusts as an army. • Listen to the noise they make: The noise made by a locust swarm can be deafening.

* **Associated Passages:** JOL 2:4–JOL 2:5
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joel 2:6 (id: 18768)

Fear grips all the people: Anticipating the invasion prepared the people for the call to repentance in [2:12–14](https://ref.ly/Joel2:12-Joel2:14).

* **Associated Passages:** JOL 2:6
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joel 2:7–9 (id: 18769)

The locusts would invade urban as well as agricultural areas, advancing like a disciplined, well\-trained army to scale city walls and swarm over the city. Finding every means of entrance, they would even climb like thieves through the windows.

* **Associated Passages:** JOL 2:7–JOL 2:9
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joel 2:10 (id: 18742)

The quaking of the earth and the heavens is a typical sign of *theophany,* an appearance of God (see [Exod 19:16–19](https://ref.ly/Exod19:16-Exod19:19); [Isa 13:13](https://ref.ly/Isa13:13); [Nah 1:5–6](https://ref.ly/Nah1:5-Nah1:6)). The darkening of the sun and moon symbolizes divine judgment ([Isa 13:9–11](https://ref.ly/Isa13:9-Isa13:11)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOL 2:10
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joel 2:11 (id: 18743)

The Lord is at the head of the column (literally *the* Lord *utters his voice before his army*): The coming destruction was not simply an act of nature or the result of human activity, but an act of God. • This is his mighty army: God executed this judgment. • Who can possibly survive? Apart from God’s grace and mercy, no one can.

* **Associated Passages:** JOL 2:11
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joel 2:12 (id: 18745)

This verse begins with the words the Lord says, a phrase that frequently accompanies divine speeches in the prophets. This is the only time that it occurs in Joel (“says the Lord” in [3:1](https://ref.ly/Joel3:1) is supplied by the translators), and it indicates that this gracious invitation came directly from God. • Turn to me now, while there is time: The Lord implored his people to repent because the day of judgment was near. There was still opportunity to avoid the coming destruction if they returned to the Lord their God with true repentance. • Unlike other prophets, Joel never catalogs the sins committed by the people of Judah and Jerusalem. Perhaps they were so obvious that he did not feel the need to list them.

* **Associated Passages:** JOL 2:12
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joel 2:12–17 (id: 18744)

Joel calls on the people to repent and throw themselves on the mercy of their compassionate God.

* **Associated Passages:** JOL 2:12–JOL 2:17
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joel 2:13 (id: 18746)

One means of showing grief in the ancient world was to tear one’s clothing ([Gen 37:34](https://ref.ly/Gen37:34); [2 Sam 3:31](https://ref.ly/2Sam3:31); [2 Kgs 19:1](https://ref.ly/2Kgs19:1)). • tear your hearts: In Hebrew, the heart is the center of thought, faith, and will. God’s people were to go beyond external demonstrations of repentance to repent inwardly—to change their orientation, priorities, and attitudes. This could only happen if they would return to the Lord. • for he is merciful and compassionate … and filled with unfailing love: The people’s only hope was in the merciful character of the Lord (see also [Exod 34:6–7](https://ref.ly/Exod34:6-Exod34:7); [Num 14:18](https://ref.ly/Num14:18); [Neh 9:17](https://ref.ly/Neh9:17); [Pss 86:15](https://ref.ly/Ps86:15); [103:8](https://ref.ly/Ps103:8); [145:8](https://ref.ly/Ps145:8); [Jon 4:2](https://ref.ly/Jonah4:2)). God’s desire is not to punish, but to forgive and restore his people.

* **Associated Passages:** JOL 2:13
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Joel 2:14 (id: 18747)

Who knows? Joel’s simple question acknowledges God’s absolute sovereignty (see also [Jon 3:9](https://ref.ly/Jonah3:9)). God is not obligated to restore us merely because we perform certain rituals. Forgiveness comes only through divine grace, but Joel knew that God was inclined to forgive ([Joel 2:13](https://ref.ly/Joel2:13)).

## Joel 2:28–29 (id: 18760)

I will pour out my Spirit upon all people: In Israel, the empowering gift of God’s Spirit had previously been given only to select individuals such as judges ([Judg 3:10](https://ref.ly/Judg3:10); [15:14](https://ref.ly/Judg15:14)), priests ([2 Chr 24:20](https://ref.ly/2Chr24:20)), kings ([1 Sam 10:10](https://ref.ly/1Sam10:10)), and prophets ([Isa 61:1](https://ref.ly/Isa61:1)). A time was coming when the Spirit would be given to every one of God’s people, regardless of gender, age, or social position. In fulfillment of Moses’ wish that every Israelite might be a prophet ([Num 11:29](https://ref.ly/Num11:29)), all would prophesy and see visions. In [Acts 2:1–47](https://ref.ly/Acts2:1-Acts2:47), Peter expanded this promise to include people from all over the known world who were gathered in Jerusalem, regardless of their ethnicity ([Acts 2:39](https://ref.ly/Acts2:39); see also [Gal 3:28](https://ref.ly/Gal3:28)).

everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved: Calling on the name of God should not be a final act of desperation; it accompanies a lifelong commitment of worship, service, and fellowship with the Lord (see [Gen 12:8](https://ref.ly/Gen12:8); [Ps 105:1](https://ref.ly/Ps105:1); [Isa 12:4](https://ref.ly/Isa12:4); [Rom 10:13](https://ref.ly/Rom10:13); [12:1–2](https://ref.ly/Rom12:1-Rom12:2)). • Those whom the Lord has called are his chosen remnant, the survivors of judgment who worship him (see [2 Kgs 19:31](https://ref.ly/2Kgs19:31); [Ezra 9:8–15](https://ref.ly/Ezra9:8-Ezra9:15); [Isa 10:20–22](https://ref.ly/Isa10:20-Isa10:22)).

The Lord would assemble the armies of the world (literally *all the nations*) in the valley of Jehoshaphat. This valley was not connected with King Jehoshaphat of Judah ([1 Kgs 22:41](https://ref.ly/1Kgs22:41)); rather, this description, which means “the valley where the Lord judges,” identifies the site as the place where God would render his decision (see [Joel 3:14](https://ref.ly/Joel3:14)) regarding the fate of the nations. • The sins of the nations include exiling God’s covenant people and victimizing helpless boys and girls in an inhuman slave trade (cp.

Hammer your plowshares into swords: Deliberately reversing an image from [Isa 2:4](https://ref.ly/Isa2:4) and [Mic 4:3](https://ref.ly/Mic4:3), Joel ordered the nations to mobilize every resource for the forthcoming battle. Even those unfit for war, the weaklings*,* must become soldiers.

The conclusion of Joel’s prophecy is the antithesis of its beginning. In [1:1–20](https://ref.ly/Joel1:1-Joel1:20), Judah’s future seemed in grave doubt. Plague and drought, the signs of divine judgment, threatened Judah’s existence. Now Joel ends with the divine assurance that Judah … and Jerusalem will endure through all generations. God’s people in every generation rest secure in the hope that his kingdom will reign over heaven and earth (see also [Isa 9:6–7](https://ref.ly/Isa9:6-Isa9:7); [Dan 2:44](https://ref.ly/Dan2:44); [7:13–14](https://ref.ly/Dan7:13-Dan7:14)).
