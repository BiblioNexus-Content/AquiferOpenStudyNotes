## Ephesians 1:1 (id: 10755)

* The frequent focus on the will of God highlights God's control in fulfilling his plan (see [1:5](https://ref.ly/Eph1:5), [9](https://ref.ly/Eph1:9), [11](https://ref.ly/Eph1:11); [5:17](https://ref.ly/Eph5:17); [6:6](https://ref.ly/Eph6:6)).
* *God’s holy people*: Literally *the holy ones*, who are devoted to God (see also [1:15](https://ref.ly/Eph1:15), [18](https://ref.ly/Eph1:18); [2:19](https://ref.ly/Eph2:19); [3:8](https://ref.ly/Eph3:8), [18](https://ref.ly/Eph3:18); [4:12](https://ref.ly/Eph4:12); [5:3](https://ref.ly/Eph5:3); [6:18](https://ref.ly/Eph6:18)).
* The oldest manuscripts do not include in Ephesus*,* and there are no personal greetings in this letter. Many scholars think the letter was originally meant to be shared among several churches in the area, not just the church in Ephesus.

## Ephesians 1:1–2 (id: 10745)

Paul follows the typical style of ancient Greek letters. He starts with a brief introduction about himself, then offers greetings. However, Paul expands this basic pattern in a distinctly Christian way. 

First, Paul refers to his divine calling as an apostle rather than just stating his name. This shows that his authority comes from God, not from himself.

Second, Paul describes the people he writes to as "God's holy people" and as "faithful followers of Christ." This reminds them of their special identity and relationship with God.

## Ephesians 1:2 (id: 10759)

Paul often asks for God's grace and peace for his readers. Grace is a blessing from God's kindness that we do not earn. Peace is a feeling of well\-being and contentment based on the good news about Jesus and brought by the Holy Spirit (see [Galatians 5:22](https://ref.ly/Gal5:22)). Both are gifts from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ (see [Romans 5:1–2](https://ref.ly/Rom5:1-Rom5:2)).

## Ephesians 1:3 (id: 10762)

Paul describes every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms in [1:4–8](https://ref.ly/Eph1:4-Eph1:8), [13–14](https://ref.ly/Eph1:13-Eph1:14). Paul focuses not on physical blessings, but on what God has done through Christ to save people and bring them closer to him.

* **Associated Passages:** EPH 1:3
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Ephesians 1:3–14 (id: 10760)

Paul praises God for all the spiritual blessings given through Jesus Christ to both non\-Jewish people (gentiles) and Jews. This section is a single, complex sentence in Greek. It is one of the longest sentences in Paul’s letters. Long sentences are typical of Paul’s writing (also in [1:15–23](https://ref.ly/Eph1:15-Eph1:23); [2:1–7](https://ref.ly/Eph2:1-Eph2:7), [14–16](https://ref.ly/Eph2:14-Eph2:16); [3:1–12](https://ref.ly/Eph3:1-Eph3:12), [14–19](https://ref.ly/Eph3:14-Eph3:19); [Colossians 1:3–29](https://ref.ly/Col1:3-Col1:29); [2:1–3](https://ref.ly/Col2:1-Col2:3), [8–15](https://ref.ly/Col2:8-Col2:15)). These sentences are interwoven (connected and linked together like threads that are knitted or laced together). This reflects the interconnectedness of their ideas. Interwoven sentences show that different ideas are closely connected and depend on each other.

## Ephesians 1:3–3.21 (id: 10761)

Ephesians has two parts: 

1. Chapters[1–3](https://ref.ly/Eph1:1-Eph3:21) praise God for his amazing grace.
2. Chapters [4–6](https://ref.ly/Eph4:1-Eph6:24) teach believers how to live in grateful response.

* **Associated Passages:** EPH 1:3

## Ephesians 1:4 (id: 10763)

God's people are holy and without fault in his eyes because they trust in Christ's sacrifice to atone for their sins (see [1:7](https://ref.ly/Eph1:7); [5:25–27](https://ref.ly/Eph5:25-Eph5:27); [Colossians 1:22](https://ref.ly/Col1:22); [Titus 3:5–7](https://ref.ly/Titus3:5-Titus3:7); [Jude 1:24](https://ref.ly/Jude1:24)).

## Ephesians 1:5 (id: 10764)

God decided in advance to adopt us into his family. By his sovereign choice, God welcomes and blesses those who trust in Christ as his children. They become heirs to all the promises God made to his people (see [1:11](https://ref.ly/Eph1:11), [14](https://ref.ly/Eph1:14); [2:19](https://ref.ly/Eph2:19); [Romans 8:15–17](https://ref.ly/Rom8:15-Rom8:17), [29–30](https://ref.ly/Rom8:29-Rom8:30); [Galatians 4:5](https://ref.ly/Gal4:5)).

## Ephesians 1:6 (id: 10765)

* Believers praise God*,* who has blessed them greatly with his forgiving grace.
* *his dear Son*: This literally means *the beloved,* a title for Jesus as the Messiah; see [Matthew 3:17](https://ref.ly/Matt3:17); [17:5](https://ref.ly/Matt17:5); [Colossians 1:13](https://ref.ly/Col1:13).

## Ephesians 1:7 (id: 10766)

* *In him we have redemption through the blood of his Son*: Believers were once prisoners of sin. Now they are free from God's judgment and from the bondage to sin because of Christ's sacrificial death (see [1:14](https://ref.ly/Eph1:14); [4:30](https://ref.ly/Eph4:30); [Romans 3:24](https://ref.ly/Rom3:24); [1 Corinthians 6:20](https://ref.ly/1Cor6:20); [Colossians 1:14](https://ref.ly/Col1:14); compare [Matthew 26:28](https://ref.ly/Matt26:28); [Mark 10:45](https://ref.ly/Mark10:45); [Hebrews 9:11–12](https://ref.ly/Heb9:11-Heb9:12), [26](https://ref.ly/Heb9:26); [1 Peter 1:18–19](https://ref.ly/1Pet1:18-1Pet1:19)).

## Ephesians 1:8–10 (id: 10767)

Wisdom and understanding come from God revealing his mysterious plan about Christ. In Paul's writings, *mysterious will* (traditionally *mystery*) often means a divine truth once hidden but now revealed in the good news (see [3:9](https://ref.ly/Eph3:9)). Here, it refers to how God will unite everything under Christ's authority, so he is universally recognized and respected as Lord (see [Philippians 2:9–11](https://ref.ly/Phil2:9-Phil2:11); [Colossians 1:16–20](https://ref.ly/Col1:16-Col1:20), [26–27](https://ref.ly/Col1:26-Col1:27); [2:2](https://ref.ly/Col2:2), [19](https://ref.ly/Col2:19); [4:3](https://ref.ly/Col4:3)). Ephesians specifically highlights the inclusion of both gentiles and Jews in God's redeemed people (see [Ephesians 3:3–6](https://ref.ly/Eph3:3-Eph3:6); [6:19](https://ref.ly/Eph6:19); compare [Romans 16:25–26](https://ref.ly/Rom16:25-Rom16:26)).

## Ephesians 1:11 (id: 10746)

* *In Him we were also chosen as God’s own*: Paul often describes salvation as an *inheritance*, a promise made to our spiritual ancestors and now received by us (see [Romans 8:17](https://ref.ly/Rom8:17); [Galatians 3:29](https://ref.ly/Gal3:29); [4:7](https://ref.ly/Gal4:7); [Colossians 1:12](https://ref.ly/Col1:12); [3:24](https://ref.ly/Col3:24)).
* God is sovereign (he has supreme power and authority over everything). Because of this, God ensures everything works according to his plan (compare [Romans 8:28–30](https://ref.ly/Rom8:28-Rom8:30)).

* **Associated Passages:** EPH 1:11

* **Associated Articles:** 

## Ephesians 1:13 (id: 10748)

*you were sealed*: In ancient times, people used seals to mark items as their personal property. Just as a *seal* shows true ownership, the Holy Spirit in a believer’s life shows God’s ownership ([4:30](https://ref.ly/Eph4:30); [2 Corinthians 1:22](https://ref.ly/2Cor1:22)).

* **Associated Passages:** EPH 1:13
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Ephesians 1:14 (id: 10749)

The Spirit serves as both God's promise of future blessings and a preview of eternal life and power. A believer's eternal inheritance includes everything God promised (see also [1:18](https://ref.ly/Eph1:18); [Romans 8:17](https://ref.ly/Rom8:17); [2 Corinthians 1:22](https://ref.ly/2Cor1:22); [5:5](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:5); [Galatians 3:29](https://ref.ly/Gal3:29); [4:7](https://ref.ly/Gal4:7); [Colossians 1:12](https://ref.ly/Col1:12); [3:24](https://ref.ly/Col3:24); [Titus 3:7](https://ref.ly/Titus3:7)).

* **Associated Passages:** EPH 1:14
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Ephesians 1:15 (id: 10751)

Paul connects faith in Christ with love for God's people. Personal faith in Christ leads to salvation. Salvation is shown mainly through a life of love (see [Galatians 5:6](https://ref.ly/Gal5:6); [Colossians 1:4](https://ref.ly/Col1:4); [1 Thessalonians 1:3](https://ref.ly/1Thess1:3); [3:6](https://ref.ly/1Thess3:6); [5:8](https://ref.ly/1Thess5:8); [2 Thessalonians 1:3](https://ref.ly/2Thess1:3); [1 Timothy 1:14](https://ref.ly/1Tim1:14); [2:15](https://ref.ly/1Tim2:15); [Titus 2:2](https://ref.ly/Titus2:2)).

* **Associated Passages:** EPH 1:17
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Ephesians 1:18 (id: 10753)

Believers confidently hope for Christ's return and the future blessings they will share. United with Christ, they become co\-heirs of all God's promised blessings.

* **Associated Passages:** EPH 1:18
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Ephesians 1:19–20 (id: 10754)

* God's power for those who believe in him is the power of his Spirit working in and through his people, because they are connected to the resurrected Christ (see [Romans 6:4–14](https://ref.ly/Rom6:4-Rom6:14); [Colossians 2:12](https://ref.ly/Col2:12)). Paul wanted to experience the power of Christ's resurrection in his own life ([Philippians 3:10](https://ref.ly/Phil3:10)).
* In biblical times, the place of honor was always at a person's right hand ([Psalm 110:1](https://ref.ly/Ps110:1); [Acts 7:56](https://ref.ly/Acts7:56)).

*far above:* Jesus has power and authority that is greater than all other powers, whether human or spiritual beings. This includes powers in the present age and in the age to come (see [3:10](https://ref.ly/Eph3:10); [6:12](https://ref.ly/Eph6:12); [John 12:31](https://ref.ly/John12:31); [Romans 8:38–39](https://ref.ly/Rom8:38-Rom8:39); [1 Corinthians 15:24](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:24); [Colossians 1:13](https://ref.ly/Col1:13); [2:10](https://ref.ly/Col2:10), [15](https://ref.ly/Col2:15); [1 Peter 3:22](https://ref.ly/1Pet3:22); [Revelation 12:7–9](https://ref.ly/Rev12:7-Rev12:9)).

* **Associated Passages:** EPH 1:21
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Ephesians 1:22 (id: 10757)

*under His feet*: In ancient Near Eastern art, victorious kings often placed their feet on the necks of their defeated enemies. Paul uses this imagery to show how Christ has defeated all his enemies and reigns as king over everything (see [Psalm 110:1](https://ref.ly/Ps110:1); [1 Corinthians 15:25–28](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:25-1Cor15:28)).

## Ephesians 1:23 (id: 10758)

*the fullness of Him who fills all in all:* This challenging phrase likely means that the church, as his body, fully expresses Christ in this world. His presence, which fills the entire universe, is reflected in and works through his body ([4:10](https://ref.ly/Eph4:10)).

* **Associated Passages:** EPH 1:23

## Ephesians 2:1–3 (id: 10769)

Paul describes how the people he was writing to were in a terrible spiritual condition before they believed in Jesus Christ. He says they were like dead people in their relationship with God (see [2:5](https://ref.ly/Eph2:5); [Colossians 2:13](https://ref.ly/Col2:13)). This spiritual death happened because of their disobedience and sins. They regularly did things that went against God's will and broke his commands.

Paul explains that their sinful actions were influenced by the power of the devil. The devil was working in their lives, leading them away from God and toward wrongdoing.

Because of this situation, the people Paul wrote to were under God's judgment. They were condemned along with everyone else in the world who did not follow God.

## Ephesians 2:2 (id: 10783)

Human sin is influenced by the devil, also called Satan, who leads the evil spiritual forces that oppose God (see [1:21](https://ref.ly/Eph1:21); [6:11–12](https://ref.ly/Eph6:11-Eph6:12); compare [Colossians 1:13](https://ref.ly/Col1:13)). This same evil spirit also rules over people who refuse to obey God ([2 Corinthians 4:4](https://ref.ly/2Cor4:4); contrast [Romans 8:2–14](https://ref.ly/Rom8:2-Rom8:14); [Galatians 5:22–23](https://ref.ly/Gal5:22-Gal5:23)).

People who have not converted are naturally controlled by their strong desires and sinful nature (see [Rom 3:9–20](https://ref.ly/Rom3:9-Rom3:20), [23](https://ref.ly/Rom3:23)). Because of their sin, they are subject to God’s anger*,* because God hates sin (see [Ephesians 5:6](https://ref.ly/Eph5:6); [Romans 1:18](https://ref.ly/Rom1:18); [2:5](https://ref.ly/Rom2:5), [8](https://ref.ly/Rom2:8); [3:5](https://ref.ly/Rom3:5), [19](https://ref.ly/Rom3:19); [4:15](https://ref.ly/Rom4:15); [5:9](https://ref.ly/Rom5:9); [9:22](https://ref.ly/Rom9:22); [12:19](https://ref.ly/Rom12:19); [13:4–5](https://ref.ly/Rom13:4-Rom13:5); [Colossians 3:6](https://ref.ly/Col3:6); [1 Thessalonians 1:10](https://ref.ly/1Thess1:10); [2:16](https://ref.ly/1Thess2:16); [5:9](https://ref.ly/1Thess5:9)).

## Ephesians 2:8–9 (id: 10789)

This is a brief summary of how a person is saved. A key belief of the good news about Jesus is that people are made righteous by trusting in Christ. They are not made righteous by their own efforts (see [Romans 1:16–17](https://ref.ly/Rom1:16-Rom1:17); [3:24–25](https://ref.ly/Rom3:24-Rom3:25); [Galatians 2:16](https://ref.ly/Gal2:16); compare [John 3:16](https://ref.ly/John3:16), [36](https://ref.ly/John3:36)). Salvation is not a reward for the good things we have done (see [Romans 3:21–4:8](https://ref.ly/Rom3:21-Rom4:8); [9:16](https://ref.ly/Rom9:16); [Galatians 3:2–10](https://ref.ly/Gal3:2-Gal3:10); [5:1–6](https://ref.ly/Gal5:1-Gal5:6); compare [2 Timothy 1:9](https://ref.ly/2Tim1:9); [Titus 3:5](https://ref.ly/Titus3:5)). Salvation is for those who trust only Christ to save them. Therefore, none of us can boast about it (compare [Romans 3:27](https://ref.ly/Rom3:27); [4:2](https://ref.ly/Rom4:2); [1 Corinthians 1:30–31](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:30-1Cor1:31); [Galatians 6:14](https://ref.ly/Gal6:14)).

*For we are God’s workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works:* Good works are the results of salvation. Good works do not cause salvation. God’s Spirit, working through a transformed heart, produces a good life ([Galatians 5:22–23](https://ref.ly/Gal5:22-Gal5:23)).

## Ephesians 2:11 (id: 10772)

Traditionally, Jews avoided Gentiles and did not consider them part of God’s people. They called them “uncircumcised,” meaning they had not received the sign of the covenant (see [Genesis 17:9–14](https://ref.ly/Gen17:9-Gen17:14)). But Paul taught that it is shallow to judge people based only on outward signs. What matters is a person’s heart and faith. In Christ, physical circumcision does not make someone part of God’s family (see [Romans 2:28–29](https://ref.ly/Rom2:28-Rom2:29)).

* **Associated Passages:** EPH 2:11
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Ephesians 2:11–22 (id: 10771)

Paul now focuses on the grace God has given particularly to gentiles (non\-Jews). God brought them into his family and united them with Jews in a new, unified, multiethnic community. This new community is the body of Christ, the church. Paul’s focus on including gentiles suggests they might have exprienced discrimination from Jewish Christians.

* **Associated Passages:** EPH 2:11–EPH 2:22

## Ephesians 2:12 (id: 10773)

Before non\-Jewish people (gentiles) became believers in Jesus Christ, they had no part in God’s people or the covenant promises God had made to made to them. They were without God and without hope (see [4:18](https://ref.ly/Eph4:18); [Colossians 1:21](https://ref.ly/Col1:21)).

* **Associated Passages:** EPH 2:12

## Ephesians 2:13 (id: 10774)

A person can only be reconciled to God by being united with Christ Jesus through trust in him (see [Romans 5:10–12](https://ref.ly/Rom5:10-Rom5:12); [2 Corinthians 5:18–21](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:18-2Cor5:21)). The blood of Christ makes this reunion possible (see [Ephesians 1:7](https://ref.ly/Eph1:7); [Romans 3:24–25](https://ref.ly/Rom3:24-Rom3:25); [5:9](https://ref.ly/Rom5:9); [Colossians 1:20](https://ref.ly/Col1:20); compare [Hebrews 9:12–15](https://ref.ly/Heb9:12-Heb9:15); [1 Peter 1:19](https://ref.ly/1Pet1:19); [1 John 1:7](https://ref.ly/1John1:7); [Revelation 1:5](https://ref.ly/Rev1:5); [5:9](https://ref.ly/Rev5:9)). When the Bible talks about "the blood of Christ," it is referring to Jesus' death as a sacrifice. Through Jesus's sacrifice, God offers forgiveness and reconciliation to all who believe.

* *For He Himself is our peace*: We have peace with God ([2:16–17](https://ref.ly/Eph2:16-Eph2:17); [Romans 5:1](https://ref.ly/Rom5:1), [10–11](https://ref.ly/Rom5:10-Rom5:11), [18–21](https://ref.ly/Rom5:18-Rom5:21); [Colossians 1:20–22](https://ref.ly/Col1:20-Col1:22)). There is also peace between Jews and gentiles (see [Ephesians 2:15–16](https://ref.ly/Eph2:15-Eph2:16); [4:3](https://ref.ly/Eph4:3)).
* *has torn down the dividing wall of hostility*: Social and religious practices traditionally divided Jews from gentiles. A low wall around the temple in Jerusalem marked the boundary that gentiles could not cross. It symbolized the separation Jews maintained from gentiles.

* The church is one new people. It is a community where love and acceptance are valued, and ethnic differences do not cause division (see [Romans 15:7–12](https://ref.ly/Rom15:7-Rom15:12); [Galatians 3:28](https://ref.ly/Gal3:28); compare [John 10:16](https://ref.ly/John10:16)).

## Ephesians 2:18 (id: 10779)

Because of Christ’s sacrifice for sins, both Jewish and gentile believers receive the Holy Spirit. This allows them to approach God openly (see [3:12](https://ref.ly/Eph3:12); compare [Acts 10:34–37](https://ref.ly/Acts10:34-Acts10:37), [44–48](https://ref.ly/Acts10:44-Acts10:48); [1 Peter 3:18](https://ref.ly/1Pet3:18)).

Gentiles who believe are no longer strangers and foreigners ([2:11–12](https://ref.ly/Eph2:11-Eph2:12), [17](https://ref.ly/Eph2:17)). Through Christ, they are fully accepted into God’s family. They become children of God, just like believing Jews (see [Romans 8:14–17](https://ref.ly/Rom8:14-Rom8:17)).

* Apostles are missionary evangelists sent by God. They travel to share the good news about Jesus with others.
* Here, the prophets seem to be from the New Testament, not the Old Testament (see [3:5](https://ref.ly/Eph3:5); [4:11](https://ref.ly/Eph4:11); see also [1 Corinthians 12:10](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:10), [28–29](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:28-1Cor12:29); [14:1–5](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:1-1Cor14:5), [22–24](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:22-1Cor14:24), [29–32](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:29-1Cor14:32), [39](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:39); compare [Acts 13:1](https://ref.ly/Acts13:1); [19:6](https://ref.ly/Acts19:6); [21:9–10](https://ref.ly/Acts21:9-Acts21:10)). In both the Old and New Testaments, prophets do not primarily predict the future. Instead, they are empowered to speak a message from God (see [1 Corinthians 12:10](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:10)).
* *on the foundation of the apostles and prophets:* This means the church is based on their faithful witness to the saving message of Christ (see [Revelation 21:14](https://ref.ly/Rev21:14); compare [Matthew 16:18](https://ref.ly/Matt16:18)). However, Christ Jesus himself is the cornerstone, the Messiah, Savior, and Lord (compare [1 Corinthians 3:11](https://ref.ly/1Cor3:11)). The cornerstone is the most important stone in a building’s foundation (see [Isaiah 28:16](https://ref.ly/Isa28:16); [Mark 12:10](https://ref.ly/Mark12:10); [Acts 4:11](https://ref.ly/Acts4:11); [1 Peter 2:6–7](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:6-1Pet2:7)).

We can approach God boldly and confidently. This means we can come into God's presence without fear or hesitation. This boldness in approaching God is not because of the good things we have done.

*from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name*: There is a wordplay in the original Greek language between the words "Father" (*patēr,* [3:14](https://ref.ly/Eph3:14)) and *family* (*patria*). This wordplay shows a connection between God as Father and all the families that exist. As the Creator of everything, God made all families—both angelic families in heaven and human families on earth. This includes all people groups, whether gentile or Jewish (see [2:14–22](https://ref.ly/Eph2:14-Eph2:22); [3:6](https://ref.ly/Eph3:6)). Because God is the Creator of everything, he has access to glorious, unlimited resources. He does not hold back these resources but gladly gives them to his children.

*to the lower parts of the earth*: This phrase has been understood in several different ways by Bible scholars. Some people have thought this phrase refers to Jesus' tomb after his crucifixion. Others have suggested it means the world of the dead, the place where spirits go after death (compare [Matthew 12:40](https://ref.ly/Matt12:40); [1 Peter 3:18–20](https://ref.ly/1Pet3:18-1Pet3:20)). Still others have connected it to the coming of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost. However, the phrase most likely refers to the incarnation. The incarnation is when Jesus Christ, who is God the Son, descended from heaven and became a human being (see [John 1:14](https://ref.ly/John1:14); [3:13](https://ref.ly/John3:13); [Philippians 2:7–8](https://ref.ly/Phil2:7-Phil2:8)).

None of these lists includes all possible gifts. This list focuses on the leadership gifts that help the church grow:

    + Apostles are people God sends out as missionary evangelists. They travel around sharing the good news about Jesus.
        + Prophets are people who speak messages from God to his people.
        + Evangelists tell others the good news about Jesus.
        + Pastors (which means *shepherds*) are people who take care of God's people (see [1 Timothy 3:1–7](https://ref.ly/1Tim3:1-1Tim3:7)).
        + Teachers are people who explain Scripture and God's truths to the church.

The goal of ministry is to help all Christians understand and experience their faith more deeply and know God's Son better. When this happens, believers become mature in the Lord (see [1 Corinthians 2:6](https://ref.ly/1Cor2:6); [14:20](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:20); [Philippians 3:15](https://ref.ly/Phil3:15); [Colossians 1:28](https://ref.ly/Col1:28); [4:12](https://ref.ly/Col4:12); compare [Hebrews 5:14](https://ref.ly/Heb5:14); [James 1:4](https://ref.ly/Jas1:4); [3:2](https://ref.ly/Jas3:2)). Christ himself is the standard of maturity. The Holy Spirit's work is to transform people to become fully like Christ ([Romans 8:29](https://ref.ly/Rom8:29)).

* Each part of the body of Christ has an important role and helps other parts grow. Christ, the head of the body, works through each part. He makes them fit together. He is the ultimate source of growth (see [Colossians 2:19](https://ref.ly/Col2:19)).
* When all believers serve effectively, the whole body will be healthy, growing, and full of love (compare [1 Corinthians 8:1](https://ref.ly/1Cor8:1)). Love is the most important factor in Christian growth ([1 Corinthians 13:1–13](https://ref.ly/1Cor13:1-1Cor13:13)).

Their minds are full of darkness because their minds are closed and hearts are hard (see [2 Corinthians 4:4](https://ref.ly/2Cor4:4)). This means they cannot understand spiritual truths clearly. Their minds are "closed," which means they are unwilling or unable to accept God's truth. Their hearts are "hard," which means they have become insensitive to God's guidance.

*Having lost all sense of shame*: Unbelievers have hard hearts, meaning they no longer listen to God's guidance. As a result, they lose the ability to know right from wrong.

A wife’s Christian commitment includes choosing to submit to her husband as part of living out her faith (see [1 Corinthians 11:3–10](https://ref.ly/1Cor11:3-1Cor11:10); [14:34–35](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:34-1Cor14:35); [Colossians 3:18](https://ref.ly/Col3:18); [1 Timothy 2:11–12](https://ref.ly/1Tim2:11-1Tim2:12); [Titus 2:5](https://ref.ly/Titus2:5); [1 Peter 3:1–6](https://ref.ly/1Pet3:1-1Pet3:6)). At the same time, all Christians (including husbands and wives) are called to submit to one another out of respect for Christ ([Ephesians 5:21](https://ref.ly/Eph5:21)). At the same time, husbands are called to love their wives and care for them sacrificially, following the example of Christ (see [Ephesians 5:21–23](https://ref.ly/Eph5:21-Eph5:23)).

Paul's final message reminds believers about the devil's opposition. Paul urges believers to protect themselves with all of God's armor.

*Put on the full armor of God*: See [Romans 13:12](https://ref.ly/Rom13:12); [2 Corinthians 10:4–5](https://ref.ly/2Cor10:4-2Cor10:5). Only with the Lord's protection can a believer resist all of the devil's plans (compare [1 Peter 5:8–9](https://ref.ly/1Pet5:8-1Pet5:9)).

## Ephesians 6:12 (id: 10868)

Believers should not see other people as their enemies. Instead, their opposition comes from spiritual evil in the unseen world. Christ has authority over that realm (see [1:21–22](https://ref.ly/Eph1:21-Eph1:22)).

God's armor helps believers resist the devil's attacks during times when evil seems strong, allowing them to stand firm.

## Ephesians 6:14 (id: 10871)

*the breastplate of righteousness*: A breastplate is a piece of armor that covers the chest to protect the heart and other vital organs during battle. In the Bible, Paul uses this image to show how righteousness—being right with God and living in a right way—protects a believer’s heart and life from the attacks of the devil. This righteousness is either:

* the righteousness God gives to those who believe in Christ, or
* the righteous way of life that the Spirit of God creates in believers.

Each one suggests the presence of the other.

## Ephesians 6:14–17 (id: 10870)

Paul uses the armor worn by Roman soldiers as a metaphor for the spiritual armor of believers. Most of this armor is for defense, not attack. Paul is not mainly focused on the exact use of each piece, but on the gifts God gives to protect his people. Trusting in Christ and knowing the Scriptures help believers stand firm against the devil’s attacks (compare [James 4:7](https://ref.ly/Jas4:7); [1 Peter 5:8–9](https://ref.ly/1Pet5:8-1Pet5:9)).

## Ephesians 6:16 (id: 10873)

* *the shield of faith*: Faith means trusting Christ as Savior or trusting God to meet needs during difficult times. Like a shield that protects a soldier from arrows, faith protects believers from fear, doubt, and the lies of the devil.
* *all the flaming arrows*: Paul uses a strong picture to describe how temptation to sin can come suddenly and powerfully (compare [Matthew 6:13](https://ref.ly/Matt6:13); [26:41](https://ref.ly/Matt26:41); [1 Corinthians 10:13](https://ref.ly/1Cor10:13); [James 1:12–15](https://ref.ly/Jas1:12-Jas1:15)). In battle, arrows were sometimes dipped in pitch and set on fire before being shot. In the same way, the devil sends dangerous temptations, but faith in God can stop them.

## Ephesians 6:17 (id: 10874)

* *take the helmet of salvation*: Just like a helmet protects a soldier’s head, the assurance of salvation protects a believer’s mind. It reminds believers that God has saved them and given them eternal life through faith in Christ.
* *the sword of the Spirit*: This is the word of God. It is like a weapon believers use to answer attacks, either by sharing the good news about Jesus, or by speaking or remembering what God has said in Scripture (compare [Jeremiah 23:29](https://ref.ly/Jer23:29); [Hebrews 4:12](https://ref.ly/Heb4:12)). A sword is a weapon with a long, sharp blade used in battle.

## Ephesians 6:18 (id: 10875)

* Paul shows the difference between mental prayer and prayer in the Spirit. Prayer in the Spirit is prayer that is led by the Spirit of God living within believers. (see [1 Corinthians 14:15](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:15); [Jude 1:20](https://ref.ly/Jude1:20); compare [Romans 8:26–27](https://ref.ly/Rom8:26-Rom8:27)).
* *every kind of prayer and petition*: Believers should make prayer a part of daily life, turning all of life into prayer (see [Philippians 4:6–7](https://ref.ly/Phil4:6-Phil4:7); [1 Thessalonians 5:17](https://ref.ly/1Thess5:17)). This is not just for themselves, but for all believers everywhere.
* *stay alert with all perseverance*: The danger of the devil is constant.

* Paul's mission was to help non\-Jews (gentiles) understand they are now accepted by God and welcomed into God's church.

* *I am an ambassador in chain*s: Although writing as a prisoner (see [3:1](https://ref.ly/Eph3:1); [4:1](https://ref.ly/Eph4:1)), Paul knew his role as God's ambassador was to continue speaking boldly for God (compare [2 Corinthians 5:20](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:20)) .

* *Peace … love … faith … grace*: These qualities are mentioned at the start of the letter ([1:2](https://ref.ly/Eph1:2), [15](https://ref.ly/Eph1:15)). Peace, love, faith, and grace are what Paul most desired for believers.
* *to the brothers:* Paul uses this term to refer to all members of the same family, both male and female.
* *to all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with an undying love:* Another way of translating this is "be eternally upon all who love our Lord Jesus Christ."
