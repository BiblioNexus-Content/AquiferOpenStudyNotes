## Isaiah 1:1 (id: 15799)

* *This is the vision*: This term introduces the book as a unified whole, covering Isaiah’s prophecies over about fifty\-five years, from around 740 to 685 BC.
* *Isaiah son of Amoz*: Nothing else is known about Isaiah’s family.
* Jerusalem*,* the capital city of Judah*,* was the center of Isaiah’s ministry. Some of his prophecies also relate to the northern kingdom, Israel (called Samaria and Ephraim, [Isaiah 9:8–21](https://ref.ly/Isa9:8-Isa9:21); [28:1–13](https://ref.ly/Isa28:1-Isa28:13)), which Assyria destroyed in 722 BC (see [2 Kings 17](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:1-2Kgs17:41)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 1:1

## Isaiah 1:2 (id: 15807)

heavens . . . earth: All of creation is called to witness the trial that God convened against Judah (cp. [Deut 31:28](https://ref.ly/Deut31:28); [32:1](https://ref.ly/Deut32:1)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 1:2

## Isaiah 1:3 (id: 15808)

an ox knows its owner: Not so with Judah. Yet despite their rebellion, God still graciously addressed them as my people.

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 1:3

## Isaiah 1:4 (id: 15809)

The expression Holy One of Israel is frequently used in Isaiah as a title for the Lord. God is the righteous and just King of heaven and earth ([6:3–5](https://ref.ly/Isa6:3-Isa6:5)), the incomparable God ([40:25](https://ref.ly/Isa40:25)), and the Redeemer of his people ([43:14](https://ref.ly/Isa43:14)). It was a terrible and foolish sin for Judah to reject him.

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 1:4

## Isaiah 1:5 (id: 15810)

God sent famine, war, disease, and death as punishment. In most cases, however, God wanted to change stubborn behavior rather than simply to punish. • As a result of their persistent rebellion, the people’s head is injured and their heart is sick. The nation was wounded physically from Assyrian aggression, while spiritually they were defiled and overtaken by sin ([64:6](https://ref.ly/Isa64:6)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 1:5

## Isaiah 1:6 (id: 15811)

without any soothing ointments or bandages: Judah’s national condition was like the body of an injured person who had not received medical care.

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 1:6

## Isaiah 1:7 (id: 15812)

country . . . towns: By 701 BC, the Assyrians had destroyed the infrastructure, taken cities, and ravaged the fields (see [64:10](https://ref.ly/Isa64:10)). This fulfilled Isaiah’s prophetic word ([6:11–13](https://ref.ly/Isa6:11-Isa6:13)). Those who survived this Assyrian onslaught would know by experience to heed later warnings of exile to Babylon ([39:6–7](https://ref.ly/Isa39:6-Isa39:7)). God does what he says he will do, so the warning of God’s judgment on all the nations is certain.

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 1:7

## Isaiah 1:8 (id: 15813)

Beautiful Jerusalem (Hebrew *The daughter of Zion*): Zion, one of the hills on which Jerusalem stands, often served as a synonym for Jerusalem. Zion carried with it the notion of God’s presence ([Ps 46](https://ref.ly/Ps46:1-Ps46:11)), his protection of his people, and Jerusalem’s resistance to enemy forces. Now, however, the opposite was true. Jerusalem had become weak, like a helpless city under siege and like an abandoned . . . shelter or lean\-to.

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 1:8

## Isaiah 1:9 (id: 15814)

The Lord of Heaven’s Armies refers to the millions of angels that are at the Lord’s command (see [2 Kgs 6:16–17](https://ref.ly/2Kgs6:16-2Kgs6:17); [Matt 26:53](https://ref.ly/Matt26:53)). At the Exodus, Moses described God as a warrior fighting for his people ([Exod 15:1–21](https://ref.ly/Exod15:1-Exod15:21)). Ironically, in Isaiah’s day, God fought against Judah because of their wickedness ([Isa 1:24](https://ref.ly/Isa1:24); [3:1–5](https://ref.ly/Isa3:1-Isa3:5)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 1:9

## Isaiah 1:10 (id: 15790)

Listen to (literally *listen to the word of*) the Lord: In this context, *listen* means to respond in obedience to the law (or *teaching;* Hebrew torah) of our God (see [2:3](https://ref.ly/Isa2:3); [5:24](https://ref.ly/Isa5:24)). • leaders . . . people: All levels of society were guilty. • Like Sodom and Gomorrah*,* Jerusalem had come under divine judgment for its rebellion against God’s laws. Jerusalem might have been utterly destroyed like those cities were it not for God’s grace ([1:9](https://ref.ly/Isa1:9); see [Gen 19](https://ref.ly/Gen19:1-Gen19:38)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 1:10

## Isaiah 1:11–15 (id: 15791)

The people had so offended God through their sin that he took no pleasure any more in their sacrifices. The Lord wanted Judah to stop the religious exercises he had commanded them to do rather than to continue them in a manner that was sinful and false ([1:13](https://ref.ly/Isa1:13)). Ritual is never an acceptable substitute for true godliness.

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 1:11–ISA 1:15

## Isaiah 1:13 (id: 15792)

The incense that accompanied offerings was intended as a sweet fragrance to the Lord (see [Exod 30:7–8](https://ref.ly/Exod30:7-Exod30:8)), but when offered with hypocrisy it was a nauseating stench and an abomination to God. • While the Lord had ordered special days for fasting at the Temple ([Lev 16:31](https://ref.ly/Lev16:31); [23:32](https://ref.ly/Lev23:32); [Num 29:7](https://ref.ly/Num29:7)), they were ruined by the guilt of Judah’s sin (see [Isa 58:1–7](https://ref.ly/Isa58:1-Isa58:7); [Matt 6:16–18](https://ref.ly/Matt6:16-Matt6:18)). • pious meetings: These holy days were associated with the new moon and other festivals (see [Lev 23](https://ref.ly/Lev23:1-Lev23:44)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 1:13

## Isaiah 1:14 (id: 15793)

New moon celebrations occurred on the first day of each lunar month ([Num 28:11–15](https://ref.ly/Num28:11-Num28:15)) and included sacrifices, feasting, and rest from work. • The annual festivals were the festivals of Passover, Harvest, Trumpets, and Shelters ([Num 28:16–29:39](https://ref.ly/Num28:16-Num29:39); [Deut 16:1–17](https://ref.ly/Deut16:1-Deut16:17)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 1:14

## Isaiah 1:15 (id: 15794)

I will not look . . . I will not listen: The Lord does not respond to prayer offered from a life of persistent wickedness. In this case, God charged the people with perverting his laws in order to practice violent injustice toward innocent victims.

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 1:15

## Isaiah 1:16 (id: 15795)

Wash . . . and be clean! The people were defiled by their sin and the uncleanness of their sacrifices. To be clean in God’s eyes, they needed to change their behavior, get rid of their sins*,* and give up their evil ways (see also [1:18](https://ref.ly/Isa1:18)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 1:16

## Isaiah 1:17 (id: 15796)

Seeking justice means upholding God’s standards of fairness and advancing the rights of the oppressed*,* orphans*,* and widows—those who are weak and marginalized in society (see also [Jer 7:5–7](https://ref.ly/Jer7:5-Jer7:7); [22:3](https://ref.ly/Jer22:3); [Zech 7:10](https://ref.ly/Zech7:10); [Matt 23:23](https://ref.ly/Matt23:23); [25:31–46](https://ref.ly/Matt25:31-Matt25:46); [Jas 1:27](https://ref.ly/Jas1:27)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 1:17

## Isaiah 1:18 (id: 15797)

God called his people to come and settle their dispute so that he could restore his covenant relationship with them. This required Judah to make a decision between obeying or turning away ([1:19–20](https://ref.ly/Isa1:19-Isa1:20)). Isaiah says their sins are like scarlet . . . they are red like crimson*,* the color of blood, which Judah had unjustly shed ([1:15](https://ref.ly/Isa1:15)). • white as snow . . . white as wool: The people would be radically transformed—cleansed, purified, and made holy (see also [Ps 51:7](https://ref.ly/Ps51:7); [Dan 7:9](https://ref.ly/Dan7:9)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 1:18

## Isaiah 1:19–20 (id: 15798)

Repentance leads to life, whereas resisting God’s will and turning away from him results in death (see [Deut 11:26–28](https://ref.ly/Deut11:26-Deut11:28); [28:1–62](https://ref.ly/Deut28:1-Deut28:62)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 1:19–ISA 1:20

## Isaiah 1:20 (id: 15800)

I, the Lord, have spoken! This statement marks the solemnity of what God has just promised. The phrase is used eleven times in Isaiah.

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 1:20

## Isaiah 1:21 (id: 15801)

The image of Jerusalem as a prostitute represents Judah’s unfaithfulness to God (see [Jer 3:6–14](https://ref.ly/Jer3:6-Jer3:14); [Ezek 16:25–26](https://ref.ly/Ezek16:25-Ezek16:26); [Hos 1–3](https://ref.ly/Hos1:1-Hos3:5)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 1:21

## Isaiah 1:24 (id: 15802)

The Lord of Heaven’s Armies, the Mighty One of Israel*,* was usually Israel’s protector ([31:5](https://ref.ly/Isa31:5)). However, in this context, God was coming to take revenge against his own people, who by their wickedness had become his enemies and foes.

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 1:24

## Isaiah 1:25 (id: 15803)

I will raise my fist against you: God, normally Israel’s protector, would become their attacker. However, he had a purpose beyond punishment. • I will melt you down. . . . I will remove all your impurities: God would use the Exile to remove the wicked from among his people and to refine those who would return.

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 1:25

## Isaiah 1:26 (id: 15804)

The restoration of the community would be marked by new leaders who uphold justice rather than perverting it (see [1:23](https://ref.ly/Isa1:23)). Jerusalem would again be pure silver (see [1:22](https://ref.ly/Isa1:22)), the Home of Justice and the Faithful City.

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 1:26

## Isaiah 1:27 (id: 15805)

Here, Zion refers to the remnant community. Only those who repent would receive God’s salvation and purification and would dwell in his presence. Zion was required to be the bastion of justice and righteousness*,* for God loves righteousness. God expected the covenant community to reflect the holy standards he cares about.

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 1:27

## Isaiah 1:29–30 (id: 15806)

The rebels ([1:28](https://ref.ly/Isa1:28)), who practiced idolatry in groves of sacred oaks and in gardens dedicated to idols*,* would become like drought\-stricken oaks and gardens. They would lack the nourishing vitality of the true God’s presence. Those who followed the Canaanite fertility religion of Baal treated gardens and trees as sacred, believing that they brought blessings. Instead, they brought spiritual death.

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 1:29–ISA 1:30

## Isaiah 2:1 (id: 15962)

vision (literally *word*): This heading (see [1:1](https://ref.ly/Isa1:1)) likely introduces the revelation of chs [2–12](https://ref.ly/Isa2:1-Isa12:6). The main focus of this section is on Judah*,* but a handful of passages expand that focus to include the nations in general ([2:2–4](https://ref.ly/Isa2:2-Isa2:4)), humanity at large ([2:6–22](https://ref.ly/Isa2:6-Isa2:22)), Syria and the northern kingdom of Israel (chs [7–9](https://ref.ly/Isa7:1-Isa9:21)), and the Assyrians (ch [10](https://ref.ly/Isa10:1-Isa10:34)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 2:1

## Isaiah 2:2 (id: 15966)

In the Old Testament, the expression the last days is a general reference to the future era (see [Jer 49:39](https://ref.ly/Jer49:39); [Ezek 38:16](https://ref.ly/Ezek38:16); [Hos 3:5](https://ref.ly/Hos3:5)); in the New Testament, it is used to refer to the period that began with the coming of the Lord Jesus ([Heb 1:2](https://ref.ly/Heb1:2)) and more specifically to the period immediately preceding the end of the present age ([2 Pet 3:3](https://ref.ly/2Pet3:3)). • The mountain of the Lord’s house referred to the Temple Mount. This location symbolized God’s glorious exaltation (see [Isa 6:1](https://ref.ly/Isa6:1)) and his kingdom on earth. Isaiah’s focus on God’s exalted and supreme kingship flows out of his famous vision of God (ch [6](https://ref.ly/Isa6:1-Isa6:13)). • Far from being a narrow nationalistic dream, Isaiah’s prophetic hope extended beyond Judah and Jerusalem to include people from all over the world.

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 2:2

## Isaiah 2:2–4 (id: 15963)

God’s gracious salvation would one day extend beyond Israel and Judah. This would prompt the nations to come to Zion, not in battle but to be blessed there and live by the rules of God’s kingdom. Isaiah encouraged Judah to look at the benefits that the nations would enjoy. He wanted to stimulate the people of Judah ([2:5](https://ref.ly/Isa2:5)) to jealousy and provoke them to follow the Lord so that they would not be left out in that day. This section is repeated almost verbatim in [Micah 4:1–3](https://ref.ly/Mic4:1-Mic4:3).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 2:2–ISA 2:4

## Isaiah 2:3 (id: 15967)

Human society will undergo changes as people conform to God’s revelation and follow his ways and paths. • Judah received the revelation (teaching . . . word) but did not obey it ([1:10–15](https://ref.ly/Isa1:10-Isa1:15)); however, the nations will be ready to do God’s will.

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 2:3

## Isaiah 2:4 (id: 15968)

The Kingdom of God is evident when conflict and violence end, and it is characterized by peace ([Rom 14:17](https://ref.ly/Rom14:17)). People will cooperate willingly or they will be forced to end their hostilities ([Ps 46:9](https://ref.ly/Ps46:9)). The nations will submit to divine arbitration rather than go to war (see [Isa 1:18–20](https://ref.ly/Isa1:18-Isa1:20)). • The words mediate and settle refer to God’s acts here, but later verses show the Messiah as the executor of justice ([11:3–4](https://ref.ly/Isa11:3-Isa11:4)). When this takes place, war will cease, and the nations will change their instruments of war into agricultural tools. • swords into plowshares: Cp. [Joel 3:10](https://ref.ly/Joel3:10), where the nations are exhorted to hammer their plowshares into swords.

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 2:4

## Isaiah 2:5 (id: 15971)

Come . . . let us walk: Walking in God’s light (his revelation) will lead to glorious participation in his kingdom (see [60:1](https://ref.ly/Isa60:1); [1 Jn 1:7](https://ref.ly/1John1:7)). God is the only light that overcomes the darkness of sin and evil ([Isa 9:2](https://ref.ly/Isa9:2)). People cannot generate such light in and of themselves ([59:9](https://ref.ly/Isa59:9)) but must walk in the light God provides, as they trust him and live in obedience to his will ([50:10](https://ref.ly/Isa50:10)). • The phrase descendants of Jacob alludes to Israel’s special historic relationship with the Lord as well as their history of sinfulness and rebellion (see [14:1](https://ref.ly/Isa14:1); [48:1](https://ref.ly/Isa48:1)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 2:5

## Isaiah 2:5–22 (id: 15969)

The prophet threatened judgment and scoffed at human pride. All human structures (religious, economic, military, social) will come under divine scrutiny and be found deficient on the day of the Lord—that final day in history when God will judge the wicked once and for all ([1 Cor 1:8](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:8); [1 Thes 5:2](https://ref.ly/1Thess5:2); [2 Thes 2:2](https://ref.ly/2Thess2:2); [2 Pet 3:10](https://ref.ly/2Pet3:10); [Rev 20:7–15](https://ref.ly/Rev20:7-Rev20:15)). At times, the prophets also used the expression “the day of the Lord” (or others like it, such as “that day”) to refer to special instances of God’s judgment upon wickedness during the course of history (see [Isa 13:6](https://ref.ly/Isa13:6), [9](https://ref.ly/Isa13:9); [Ezek 13:5](https://ref.ly/Ezek13:5); [30:3](https://ref.ly/Ezek30:3); [Obad 1:15](https://ref.ly/Obad1:15)). On the day of the Lord, God alone will be exalted, while all human wickedness and pride will be struck down. The glorious day of God’s coming will fill wicked and arrogant humans with terror ([Isa 2:10](https://ref.ly/Isa2:10), [19](https://ref.ly/Isa2:19), [21](https://ref.ly/Isa2:21)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 2:5–ISA 2:22

## Isaiah 2:5–4.1 (id: 15970)

Isaiah condemned Israel’s and Judah’s arrogance and self\-exaltation, warning them that only God was to be exalted. All attempts by humans to lift themselves up will actually result in humiliation.

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 2:5–ISA 4:1

## Isaiah 2:6 (id: 15972)

The Lord had rejected his people to discipline them ([8:17](https://ref.ly/Isa8:17)). While not permanent, the rejection seriously threatened their expectations of a glorious future. • sorcerers: These practitioners of pagan religion were expressly banned from Israel ([Deut 18:10–11](https://ref.ly/Deut18:10-Deut18:11)). • The Philistines were Israel’s ancient enemies ([Isa 9:12](https://ref.ly/Isa9:12); [11:14](https://ref.ly/Isa11:14); [14:29](https://ref.ly/Isa14:29), [31](https://ref.ly/Isa14:31)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 2:6

## Isaiah 2:7–8 (id: 15973)

Isaiah pointed out all the things that people substitute for the true God: material achievements and securities (silver . . . treasures), military strength (warhorses . . . chariots), and objects of affection (idols). Such wealth and military strength characterized the reign of King Uzziah ([2 Chr 26:6–21](https://ref.ly/2Chr26:6-2Chr26:21)). Elsewhere, Isaiah pointed out the sheer folly of worshiping anything that is made with one’s own hands (see [Isa 44:9–20](https://ref.ly/Isa44:9-Isa44:20); [45:16](https://ref.ly/Isa45:16)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 2:7–ISA 2:8

## Isaiah 2:10 (id: 15956)

In the day of God’s judgment, people will seek refuge in caves in the rocks*,* natural hiding places in the rocky land of Judah, rather than repent in humility before almighty God. Kings and leaders as well as slaves and free persons will seek protection from judgment (see also [Rev 6:15](https://ref.ly/Rev6:15)). • The terror of the Lord refers to God’s unbridled wrath against wickedness that will be revealed on the day of the Lord’s judgment. The prophecy shifts from Israel ([Isa 2:5–6](https://ref.ly/Isa2:5-Isa2:6)) to humanity at large. The Lord is against anything and anyone that exalts and trusts in human structures and beliefs rather than in him ([2:11–12](https://ref.ly/Isa2:11-Isa2:12), [22](https://ref.ly/Isa2:22)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 2:10

## Isaiah 2:11–12 (id: 15957)

A key theme in Isaiah is that the Lord will be exalted and humble people will be restored ([57:15](https://ref.ly/Isa57:15)), while proud and mighty people are humbled ([26:5](https://ref.ly/Isa26:5)). • The day of judgment and the “day of reckoning” are also called the “day of the Lord.” There are seven such references in chs [2–4](https://ref.ly/Isa2:1-Isa4:6) ([2:11](https://ref.ly/Isa2:11), [17](https://ref.ly/Isa2:17), [20](https://ref.ly/Isa2:20); [3:6](https://ref.ly/Isa3:6), [18](https://ref.ly/Isa3:18); [4:1](https://ref.ly/Isa4:1), [2](https://ref.ly/Isa4:2)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 2:11–ISA 2:12

## Isaiah 2:13 (id: 15959)

The cedars of Lebanon were prized trees used in the construction of Solomon’s Temple and palace ([1 Kgs 5:6](https://ref.ly/1Kgs5:6)) and other important buildings ([Ezra 3:7](https://ref.ly/Ezra3:7)). They represented wealth and power ([2 Chr 25:18](https://ref.ly/2Chr25:18); [Pss 92:12](https://ref.ly/Ps92:12); [104:16](https://ref.ly/Ps104:16)), yet these mighty trees were as nothing before the Lord ([Isa 10:34](https://ref.ly/Isa10:34); [33:9](https://ref.ly/Isa33:9); see the boast of Sennacherib in [37:24](https://ref.ly/Isa37:24)). • The oaks of Bashan were also an image of strength and splendor ([Ezek 27:6](https://ref.ly/Ezek27:6)); they, too, will disappoint ([Isa 33:9](https://ref.ly/Isa33:9); [Nah 1:4](https://ref.ly/Nah1:4); [Zech 11:2](https://ref.ly/Zech11:2)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 2:13

## Isaiah 2:13–16 (id: 15958)

The prophet used several images of human strength to elaborate on [2:11–12](https://ref.ly/Isa2:11-Isa2:12).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 2:13–ISA 2:16

## Isaiah 2:16 (id: 15960)

every magnificent vessel: Ornate sea\-going vessels were a sign of prosperity.

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 2:16

## Isaiah 2:17 (id: 15961)

The day of judgment is the “day of the Lord” (see [13:4–13](https://ref.ly/Isa13:4-Isa13:13)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 2:17

## Isaiah 2:20–21 (id: 15964)

Animals such as rodents and bats lead a shadowy, subterranean existence. Those who worship idols will become like them in attempting to escape the Lord’s judgment.

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 2:20–ISA 2:21

## Isaiah 2:22 (id: 15965)

The judgment prophecy of [2:6–21](https://ref.ly/Isa2:6-Isa2:21) is set between two related exhortations: to trust the Lord ([2:5](https://ref.ly/Isa2:5)) and not to put trust in human beings ([2:22](https://ref.ly/Isa2:22)). • Human strength is temporary, frail as breath (see [Ps 90](https://ref.ly/Ps90:1-Ps90:17)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 2:22

## Isaiah 3:1 (id: 16140)

take away . . . bread . . . water: God had long ago warned of famine, with its horrible conditions that sometimes led to desperate acts, as one possible judgment for wickedness ([Lev 26:26–29](https://ref.ly/Lev26:26-Lev26:29)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 3:1

## Isaiah 3:1–12 (id: 16131)

These verses continue the subject of judgment against Israel’s leadership (see [1:23–25](https://ref.ly/Isa1:23-Isa1:25)). The removal of leadership at all levels would allow the mob to gain control. Chaos and famine would turn Judah and Jerusalem into a social wasteland.

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 3:1–ISA 3:12

## Isaiah 3:2–3 (id: 16141)

Regardless of their status, all military, civil, judicial, and religious leaders would be removed in the day of judgment ([39:7](https://ref.ly/Isa39:7); [2 Kgs 24:14–16](https://ref.ly/2Kgs24:14-2Kgs24:16)). God would eventually give his people good leaders again ([Isa 1:26](https://ref.ly/Isa1:26)) but not diviners and others who used pagan forms of revelation ([47:9](https://ref.ly/Isa47:9), [12–13](https://ref.ly/Isa47:12-Isa47:13); see [Deut 18:10–12](https://ref.ly/Deut18:10-Deut18:12)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 3:2–ISA 3:3

## Isaiah 3:4 (id: 16143)

Conditions would be so severe that boys and toddlers would qualify as candidates for office. By this, Isaiah either meant that adult leaders would be so decimated that only children would be left alive to assume the role or simply that the new leaders would be as immature, unwise, strong willed, and inexperienced as children.

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 3:4

## Isaiah 3:6–7 (id: 16144)

Things would be so bad (a heap of ruins) that no one would want to take leadership. The people would become so desperate that anyone providing food or clothes ([3:7](https://ref.ly/Isa3:7)) could be the leader of the people. In fact, however, no one would have food or clothing (see [4:1](https://ref.ly/Isa4:1)).

The Lord cares for the poor. These were the marginalized and oppressed (see [1:17](https://ref.ly/Isa1:17)), but God is their protector (see [25:4](https://ref.ly/Isa25:4)).

## Isaiah 3:16–4.1 (id: 16137)

This passage applies the prophet’s teaching on arrogance (see [2:11–12](https://ref.ly/Isa2:11-Isa2:12)) to the people of Jerusalem. An alternate understanding is that this passage applies specifically to the women of Jerusalem.

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 3:16–ISA 4:1

## Isaiah 3:17–25 (id: 16139)

In a reversal of fortune, the affluent and proud people of Jerusalem would suffer disgrace. Some of their ornaments ([3:18](https://ref.ly/Isa3:18)) likely were amulets to keep evil away, but they could not ward off the calamity of judgment. These items of beauty were status symbols and represented financial security.

## Isaiah 4:1 (id: 16283)

During Isaiah’s ministry, Jerusalem’s population was so decimated through war, famine, and disease ([3:1–3](https://ref.ly/Isa3:1-Isa3:3); [6:13](https://ref.ly/Isa6:13); [14:30](https://ref.ly/Isa14:30); [22:2](https://ref.ly/Isa22:2); [37:4](https://ref.ly/Isa37:4)) that there were few men left, creating an absence of leadership (see [3:1–12](https://ref.ly/Isa3:1-Isa3:12)). Even worse conditions lay ahead with the approaching war between Judah and the alliance of Syria and Israel in 734–732 BC ([2 Chr 28](https://ref.ly/2Chr28:1-2Chr28:27)) and eventually the conquest and fall of Jerusalem (605–586 BC).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 4:1

## Isaiah 4:2 (id: 16285)

The branch in this context probably refers to the remnant that would constitute Israel’s new beginning after the Exile (see [6:13](https://ref.ly/Isa6:13)). Some also understand it as representing the ideal descendant of David, the Messiah (see [11:1](https://ref.ly/Isa11:1); [Jer 23:5](https://ref.ly/Jer23:5); [33:15–16](https://ref.ly/Jer33:15-Jer33:16); [Zech 3:8](https://ref.ly/Zech3:8); [6:12](https://ref.ly/Zech6:12)). • A beautiful and glorious transformation from shame and disgrace ([Isa 3:17–25](https://ref.ly/Isa3:17-Isa3:25)) to fertility and beauty would manifest God’s presence and blessing among the remnant ([4:6](https://ref.ly/Isa4:6)). • The fruit of the land*,* nature itself, would also be transformed from desolation to glory. Elsewhere, Isaiah described the future circumstances as resembling the Garden of Eden (see [51:3](https://ref.ly/Isa51:3); [65:22](https://ref.ly/Isa65:22)). The message of renewal finds its ultimate fulfillment in the new creation (see [Rom 8:19–27](https://ref.ly/Rom8:19-Rom8:27); [2 Cor 5:17](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:17); [Gal 6:15](https://ref.ly/Gal6:15); [Eph 2:15](https://ref.ly/Eph2:15); [4:24](https://ref.ly/Eph4:24); [Rev 21:22–27](https://ref.ly/Rev21:22-Rev21:27)). • Those who survive in Israel—the remnant—would be the true citizens of Zion.

## Isaiah 4:2–6 (id: 16284)

In bold contrast to the desperate picture of [3:16–4:1](https://ref.ly/Isa3:16-Isa4:1), this prophecy of salvation and hope (see also [2:2–4](https://ref.ly/Isa2:2-Isa2:4)) promised cleansing, consecration, and the renewal of God’s presence with the remnant. The imagery in [4:5–6](https://ref.ly/Isa4:5-Isa4:6) alludes to Israel’s exodus from Egypt, when a pillar of cloud and of fire guided and protected them. Israel’s restoration from exile would be a second exodus.

## Isaiah 5:1 (id: 16457)

The one I love refers to the Lord; the prophet was singing this song on the Lord’s behalf. • At first, the song sounds like a love song, but by [5:3](https://ref.ly/Isa5:3) readers realize it is actually a complaint. • On Israel as God’s vineyard, see also [3:14](https://ref.ly/Isa3:14); [Matt 21:33–46](https://ref.ly/Matt21:33-Matt21:46); [John 15:1–17](https://ref.ly/John15:1-John15:17).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 5:1

## Isaiah 5:1–7 (id: 16447)

The Song of the Vineyard expresses in poetic form God’s indictment of the wicked leadership that had ruined his vineyard, Israel. Like some wisdom literature, it presents readers with an account of a puzzling situation ([5:1–2](https://ref.ly/Isa5:1-Isa5:2)) before giving its spiritual significance ([5:3–7](https://ref.ly/Isa5:3-Isa5:7)). The theme of the vineyard’s transformation is found again in ch [27](https://ref.ly/Isa27:1-Isa27:13) and in Jesus’ teaching ([Matt 21:33](https://ref.ly/Matt21:33); [Mark 12:1](https://ref.ly/Mark12:1)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 5:1–ISA 5:7

## Isaiah 5:1–30 (id: 16446)

The prophet pronounced judgment through song ([5:1–7](https://ref.ly/Isa5:1-Isa5:7)) and prophecies of woe ([5:8–30](https://ref.ly/Isa5:8-Isa5:30)). Although Israel’s future condition would be one of purity and fellowship with God ([4:2–6](https://ref.ly/Isa4:2-Isa4:6)), that future cannot ignore the present sinful condition of the people and their leaders.

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 5:1–ISA 5:30

## Isaiah 5:2 (id: 16464)

The Lord gave the best care to his vineyard, preparing and nursing it as an expert agriculturalist. He watched over it with great attentiveness, planting the best vines—ones that had the potential for abundant sweet grapes. God had great expectations of Israel as his people (see [Exod 19:5–6](https://ref.ly/Exod19:5-Exod19:6)), so the bitter grapes they produced—their unrighteous deeds—were useless and disappointing (cp. [Gal 5:22–23](https://ref.ly/Gal5:22-Gal5:23)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 5:2

## Isaiah 5:3–4 (id: 16465)

Clearly, the Lord had graciously done everything possible for the vineyard. He was not to blame for the bitter grapes. • you judge: Isaiah wanted the audience to condemn the vineyard before he revealed that in fact they were the vineyard ([5:7](https://ref.ly/Isa5:7)). This rhetorical tactic is similar to the one Nathan used to confront David ([2 Sam 12:1–5](https://ref.ly/2Sam12:1-2Sam12:5)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 5:3–ISA 5:4

## Isaiah 5:5–6 (id: 16467)

The Lord promised to make his vineyard*,* Israel, a desolate place because it was fit only for destruction. Later, Isaiah prophesied the gracious, glorious transformation of Israel from desolation to fruitful vitality (see [55:13](https://ref.ly/Isa55:13)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 5:5–ISA 5:6

## Isaiah 5:6 (id: 16468)

The withholding of rain was at times a divine judgment ([Deut 28:23–24](https://ref.ly/Deut28:23-Deut28:24); [Hag 1:11](https://ref.ly/Hag1:11); [2:16](https://ref.ly/Hag2:16)). It was especially devastating to a society that depended heavily on agriculture.

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 5:6

## Isaiah 5:7 (id: 16469)

The identification of Israel as the vineyard is a surprise that resolves the riddle of this passage. • Here, a powerful play on Hebrew words indicted Israel. The Lord expected justice (Hebrew mishpat) but saw only oppression (mispakh) of the needy. Instead of righteousness (tsedaqah), there were cries of violence (tse‘aqah) against the poor (see [1:21–23](https://ref.ly/Isa1:21-Isa1:23)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 5:7

## Isaiah 5:8–10 (id: 16470)

What sorrow: The first threat of judgment was against oppressive greed. Properties (house and field) were being taken by illegal means. The new owners were thugs who used every avenue to enrich themselves at the expense of the poor (see [1 Kgs 21:1–29](https://ref.ly/1Kgs21:1-1Kgs21:29); [Amos 2:6–7](https://ref.ly/Amos2:6-Amos2:7)).

## Isaiah 5:19 (id: 16456)

The people challenged God to hurry up and do something to prove that he really exists and is in control of this world.

The same Hebrew words are used in the name *Maher*\-*shalal*\-*hash*\-*baz* ([Isa 8:1](https://ref.ly/Isa8:1)). • God’s plan was revealed to Isaiah.

God’s appearance in judgment or salvation in natural phenomena such as smoke, darkness, lightning, and earthquake is called a theophany (see [6:1–4](https://ref.ly/Isa6:1-Isa6:4), [6](https://ref.ly/Isa6:6); [13:13](https://ref.ly/Isa13:13); [Exod 19:18–19](https://ref.ly/Exod19:18-Exod19:19); [Ps 18:7–15](https://ref.ly/Ps18:7-Ps18:15); [Mic 1:3–4](https://ref.ly/Mic1:3-Mic1:4); [Rev 8:5](https://ref.ly/Rev8:5); [16:17–18](https://ref.ly/Rev16:17-Rev16:18); [18:21–22](https://ref.ly/Rev18:21-Rev18:22)).

The expression signal to distant nations is common in Isaiah and might be a call for participation in battle (as here) or in salvation ([11:10](https://ref.ly/Isa11:10), [12](https://ref.ly/Isa11:12); [49:22](https://ref.ly/Isa49:22); [62:10](https://ref.ly/Isa62:10)). • Distant nations refers to the Assyrians and Babylonians, who served as instruments of God’s judgment on Israel (722 BC) and on Judah (586 BC).

## Isaiah 6:1 (id: 16622)

At the time of King Uzziah’s death, the Assyrians had begun to reassert their dominance in the ancient Near East. It marked the beginning of an era dominated by major world powers—Assyria, then Babylonia, Persia, Greece, and Rome. • I saw the Lord: “Lord” (Hebrew ’adonay) is used to describe human rulers as well as God. God is the supreme King. • on a lofty throne: The apostle John also had a vision of God’s heavenly throne (see [Rev 4:2](https://ref.ly/Rev4:2); [7:10](https://ref.ly/Rev7:10); [21:5](https://ref.ly/Rev21:5)). • If just the train of the Lord’s robe filled the Temple, how great and majestic must have been the robe itself and the one wearing it.

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 6:1

## Isaiah 6:1–13 (id: 16618)

Isaiah’s marvelous vision of God as King on his throne served as a pivotal event in the life of the prophet. The historical circumstances surrounding this event can be interpreted in two ways: (1\) Some see ch [6](https://ref.ly/Isa6:1-Isa6:13) as Isaiah’s original call to ministry, meaning that chs [1–5](https://ref.ly/Isa1:1-Isa5:30) and [7–12](https://ref.ly/Isa7:1-Isa12:6) fit into the reign of Ahaz, who came to rule after the death of Uzziah ([6:1](https://ref.ly/Isa6:1)). If this were so, why was Isaiah’s call not at the beginning of the book? Perhaps his call was put in ch [6](https://ref.ly/Isa6:1-Isa6:13) for literary reasons, serving as a conclusion to chs [1–5](https://ref.ly/Isa1:1-Isa5:30) and an introduction to chs [7–12](https://ref.ly/Isa7:1-Isa12:6). The prophet’s own transformation and commissioning symbolizes the entire nation’s need for conversion if it wants to fulfill its mandate to be God’s light to the world. (2\) Others understand chs [1–12](https://ref.ly/Isa1:1-Isa12:6) as chronological; Isaiah’s call in ch [6](https://ref.ly/Isa6:1-Isa6:13) would then serve as a recommissioning of the prophet to minister in a new way in a different period (the time of Ahaz) when his words would be rejected. Those who hold this interpretation point to [2:7–9](https://ref.ly/Isa2:7-Isa2:9); [3:16–24](https://ref.ly/Isa3:16-Isa3:24); [and 5:8–14](https://ref.ly/Isa5:8-Isa5:14), contending that these passages reflect a time of prosperity, military strength, pride, and splendor; these conditions existed during Uzziah’s reign but not during Ahaz’s reign.

The mighty seraphim are heavenly beings not mentioned elsewhere in Scripture (but see also [Rev 4:6–9](https://ref.ly/Rev4:6-Rev4:9); [15:8](https://ref.ly/Rev15:8)). The Hebrew term might suggest an association with fire. They covered their faces so as not to look on God.

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 6:2

## Isaiah 6:3 (id: 16624)

The triple usage of the word holy emphasizes the absolute separateness of the Lord. • The whole earth is filled: Because there is no verb in the Hebrew, two slightly different translations of the seraphim’s proclamation are possible. It could be that the earth*,* though defiled, is currently filled with his glory in creation. Or, it could mean that the earth *will* be filled with the glory of the Lord when he establishes his kingship on the earth in the future. Either way, the Lord’s glorious presence will one day dwell more fully on earth, despite humanity’s sinfulness and the power of wicked nations. God’s glory was further revealed in the incarnation of the Son ([John 12:41](https://ref.ly/John12:41); [2 Cor 3:18](https://ref.ly/2Cor3:18); [4:4–7](https://ref.ly/2Cor4:4-2Cor4:7)).

It’s all over! I am doomed: The prophet felt unworthy of the vision. He was painfully aware of his personal uncleanness (sinful . . . filthy lips) when compared to the holiness of God. Isaiah knew that he was unworthy to speak the pure word of God, as were his people.

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 6:5

## Isaiah 6:7 (id: 16626)

## Isaiah 6:9 (id: 16628)

do not understand . . . learn nothing: The prophet’s words brought out the heart response of his audience. The people were so sunk in sin that when they heard the truth it did not bring them closer to God but actually drove them away (e.g., Ahaz, ch [7](https://ref.ly/Isa7:1-Isa7:25)). Yet the truth had to be declared. Jesus also applied this principle in his own preaching ([Matt 13:14–15](https://ref.ly/Matt13:14-Matt13:15); [Luke 8:10](https://ref.ly/Luke8:10); [19:42](https://ref.ly/Luke19:42); [John 12:40](https://ref.ly/John12:40); see also [Acts 28:26–27](https://ref.ly/Acts28:26-Acts28:27); [Rom 11:8](https://ref.ly/Rom11:8)).

## Isaiah 6:13 (id: 16621)

Even if a tenth—a remnant—survive*,* the judgment would continue until nearly all were destroyed.

At one point in his reign, Ahaz found himself in a crisis. The leaders of Syria and Israel attacked Judah. They planned to replace Ahaz and force Judah to join them in their resistance against Assyria. Ahaz responded by calling Assyria in to help him ([2 Kgs 16:7–10](https://ref.ly/2Kgs16:7-2Kgs16:10)), thus refusing Isaiah’s challenge to trust the Lord instead ([Isa 7:12](https://ref.ly/Isa7:12)). Although the Assyrians squelched the alliance of Syria and Israel, leading to the eventual downfall of both those nations, they also soon set their sights on total domination of Judah.

## Isaiah 7:9 (id: 16737)

The last sentence is a play on two Hebrew words: If you do not have faith (ta’aminu), you will not stand firm (te’amenu). Firm trust in the Lord is utterly essential, especially for a leader of God’s people (see also [2 Chr 20:20](https://ref.ly/2Chr20:20)), and it must be firmly acted upon in order to demonstrate that it exists. Ahaz and his contemporaries trusted their enemy (Assyria) rather than God. By contrast, Hezekiah later demonstrated his faith in the Lord in a similar context (see [Isa 36–38](https://ref.ly/Isa36:1-Isa38:22)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 7:9

## Isaiah 7:11 (id: 16722)

A sign of confirmation would be performed before Ahaz’s eyes as a token of God’s truthfulness. His son Hezekiah would also receive such a sign (see [37:30](https://ref.ly/Isa37:30)).

## Isaiah 7:12 (id: 16723)

I will not test the Lord like that: Despite this seemingly pious response (based on [Deut 6:16](https://ref.ly/Deut6:16)), Ahaz was most likely already in negotiations with the Assyrians and had already decided whom he would trust for rescue in this war.

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 7:12

## Isaiah 7:14 (id: 16724)

This prophecy received its ultimate fulfillment in the birth of Jesus Christ ([Matt 1:18–24](https://ref.ly/Matt1:18-Matt1:24)). Yet it is likely that it also had a partial fulfillment in Isaiah’s day, either with the birth of godly king Hezekiah, Ahaz’s son, or with the birth of one of Isaiah’s children. The similar sequence of the verbs in [Isa 7:14](https://ref.ly/Isa7:14) and [8:3](https://ref.ly/Isa8:3) (conceive . . . give birth . . . call) and the link between Immanuel and Maher\-shalal\-hash\-baz in [8:5–10](https://ref.ly/Isa8:5-Isa8:10) suggest that Immanuel and Maher\-shalal\-hash\-baz were the same person. • The name Immanuel (which means ‘God is with us’) symbolized God’s presence and protection. God was with Judah during the attack by the alliance of Syria and Israel (734 BC), in the Assyrian crisis (701 BC), and throughout their prolonged existence until their fall in 586 BC. The kingdom of Israel fell during the time of Isaiah (722 BC). The assurance “I am with you” remained significant even in the exilic and postexilic periods ([41:10](https://ref.ly/Isa41:10); [43:2](https://ref.ly/Isa43:2),[5](https://ref.ly/Isa43:5)). The greatest assurance ultimately came in Jesus Christ, the incarnate Son of God ([Matt 1:23](https://ref.ly/Matt1:23); see also [Rev 12:5](https://ref.ly/Rev12:5)).

## Isaiah 8:1 (id: 16748)

The meaning of the name Maher\-shalal\-hash\-baz (“Swift to plunder and quick to carry away”) applies both to Judah’s enemies ([8:4](https://ref.ly/Isa8:4)) and to Judah itself ([8:7–8](https://ref.ly/Isa8:7-Isa8:8)). They had trusted Assyria in place of God, and now Assyria would turn on them and all but destroy them. God was with them (*Immanuel;* see [7:14](https://ref.ly/Isa7:14)), but his presence would be destructive if they refused to trust in him (see [8:14](https://ref.ly/Isa8:14)).

## Isaiah 8:3 (id: 16750)

Like the name *Immanuel* ([Isaiah 7:14](https://ref.ly/Isa7:14)), Maher\-shalal\-hash\-baz is symbolic.

The gently flowing waters of Shiloah supplied Jerusalem with water. Here they represent God’s loving presence and provision (see [Ps 46:4](https://ref.ly/Ps46:4)). • Ahaz rejected the sign and the promise of God’s protection. He was not a man of faith ([Isa 7:9](https://ref.ly/Isa7:9)), and now the people were following in his footsteps by placing their hope in Assyria to save them from King Rezin and King Pekah (cp.

This text reveals the heart of Isaiah’s message. The issue was fear of the Lord versus fear of people (see [7:9](https://ref.ly/Isa7:9); [8:6](https://ref.ly/Isa8:6)). When an individual fears people, the Lord becomes a trap and destruction is certain (cp. [Prov 29:25](https://ref.ly/Prov29:25); see “Fearing People” Theme Note).

People regarded Isaiah’s message of non\-involvement with Assyria as treasonous, part of a conspiracy.

## Isaiah 8:17 (id: 16745)

I will wait for the Lord . . . I will put my hope in him: Isaiah’s message against Syria, Israel, and Assyria would be proven true in the historical events that followed. The fulfillment would further encourage the godly to await the final downfall of all ungodly power structures (see [8:9–10](https://ref.ly/Isa8:9-Isa8:10)).

I and the children the Lord has given me (see the application to Jesus Christ in [Heb 2:13](https://ref.ly/Heb2:13)): The names of the prophet Isaiah and his children carried significance as signs and warnings. Shear\-jashub (*a remnant will return;* [7:3](https://ref.ly/Isa7:3)) was a sign of God’s faithfulness to Judah. Maher\-shalal\-hash\-baz (*swift to plunder and quick to carry away*) signified the destruction of Damascus and Samaria ([8:1–4](https://ref.ly/Isa8:1-Isa8:4)) and the desolation of faithless Judah ([8:5–8](https://ref.ly/Isa8:5-Isa8:8)). The name of Isaiah (*Yahweh is salvation*) itself signifies that salvation is from the Lord alone. These three names also represent major themes in the book: the remnant, the desolation of Judah, and salvation. Immanuel (*God is with us*) embodies all of these themes, along with the idea that Judah would be protected if only it would trust in the Lord.

## Isaiah 9:21 (id: 16764)

Manasseh and Ephraim represent the northern kingdom as its largest tribes. The two largest tribes of Israel and Judah fought amongst themselves. This is probably a reference to the war between Judah and the alliance of Syria and Israel, which is commonly called the Syro\-Ephraimite War ([7:1–12](https://ref.ly/Isa7:1-Isa7:12)). In that conflict, brothers savagely fought against brothers ([2 Chr 28](https://ref.ly/2Chr28:1-2Chr28:27)).

Look, the Assyrians are now at Aiath: The march described in [10:29–32](https://ref.ly/Isa10:29-Isa10:32) is a poetic account of Assyria’s defeat. The places follow a route from the north down to Jerusalem. Upon arriving at Jerusalem, the Assyrians were forced to retreat. God was with Jerusalem, and eventually Assyria would be utterly destroyed. This passage might foretell Sennacherib’s invasion in 701 BC (see chs [36–37](https://ref.ly/Isa36:1-Isa37:38)), but it could just as well describe an earlier or later invasion.

## Isaiah 13:1 (id: 15865)

At the time of this prophecy, Assyria was the major power. Isaiah anticipated the rise of Babylon as an even crueler kingdom that would destroy Judah and Jerusalem ([39:6–7](https://ref.ly/Isa39:6-Isa39:7); chs [46–47](https://ref.ly/Isa46:1-Isa47:15)). The universal language of [13:1–14:23](https://ref.ly/Isa13:1-Isa14:23) suggests that in this context, Babylon represents all wicked and arrogant nations in the same way that “Babylon the Great” does in the book of Revelation ([Rev 18](https://ref.ly/Rev18:1-Rev18:24)). Therefore, while this description of Babylon’s fall applies to the fall of historic Babylon in 539 BC, it also applies until the final judgment against the ultimate kingdom of evil ([Rev 19](https://ref.ly/Rev19:1-Rev19:21)).

five of Egypt’s cities: This is probably just a way of saying “a number of cities” (see also [17:6](https://ref.ly/Isa17:6); [30:17](https://ref.ly/Isa30:17)). • Jews living in Egypt after the destruction of Jerusalem spoke Hebrew, here called the language of Canaan. • Heliopolis was devoted to Re, the sun god. At a time when Judah was resisting the Lord, Isaiah envisioned the Egyptians following the Lord.

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 19:22

## Isaiah 19:23 (id: 15948)

Traditionally, Egypt and Assyria were enemies of one another and of Israel. They were idolatrous to the core, but they would leave behind their enmity and their idols to worship the true God. • In the rugged terrain of the ancient Near East, a highway provided a means for safe, easy travel and trade (see [11:16](https://ref.ly/Isa11:16); [35:8](https://ref.ly/Isa35:8); [40:3](https://ref.ly/Isa40:3); [62:10](https://ref.ly/Isa62:10)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 20:1–ISA 20:5

## Isaiah 20:2 (id: 15976)

Prophets characteristically wore burlap or other rough clothing as a sign of mourning over the sins of the people (see [2 Kgs 1:8](https://ref.ly/2Kgs1:8); [Mark 1:6](https://ref.ly/Mark1:6)). • naked: That is, exposed in some way, possibly even completely nude.

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 20:5–ISA 20:6

## Isaiah 21:1 (id: 15989)

concerning Babylon—the desert by the sea: This description of Babylon was perhaps an ironic way to say that the land was physically lush but spiritually desolate. • Disaster . . . from the desert: Literally *from the desert, from the terrifying land* (cp. [Deut 8:15](https://ref.ly/Deut8:15)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 21:1

## Isaiah 21:2 (id: 15990)

I see: The prophet personalized Babylon’s experience, which intensifies his poetry, as does the terse language and the repetition of similar sounds, such as the betrayer betraying (Hebrew habboged boged) and the destroyer destroying (Hebrew hashoded shoded; also in [33:1](https://ref.ly/Isa33:1)). • The Elamites lived to the northeast of Babylon. Along with the Medes, they were archrivals of the Babylonians. • I will make an end to all the groaning Babylon caused: Babylon had caused groaning by attacking and enslaving many nations. It is likely that the Elamites and Medes played a part in the overthrow of Babylon in 539 BC ([21:9](https://ref.ly/Isa21:9)).

## Isaiah 21:9 (id: 15993)

Babylon is fallen, fallen: Assyrian king Sennacherib destroyed the city of Babylon in 689 BC. The final fall of Babylon was in 539 BC. In Scripture, Babylon represents all the ungodly power structures of this world, including nations and kingdoms that do not submit to God and his word. The apostle John gave hope with his prophecy that all Babylons will fall ([Rev 14:8](https://ref.ly/Rev14:8); [18:2](https://ref.ly/Rev18:2)). • All the idols of Babylon lie broken: False gods could not save the Babylonians (see [Isa 46:1–2](https://ref.ly/Isa46:1-Isa46:2)).

Dedan was a tribe in Arabia (see [Ezek 27:20](https://ref.ly/Ezek27:20); [38:13](https://ref.ly/Ezek38:13)). • Caravans would hide in the deserts of Arabia from attacks by the Assyrians and Babylonians, both of whom harassed the Arabian tribes (see [Isa 21:1–10](https://ref.ly/Isa21:1-Isa21:10); [Jer 49:28–29](https://ref.ly/Jer49:28-Jer49:29)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 21:17

## Isaiah 22:1 (id: 16003)

concerning Jerusalem—the Valley of Vision: The meaning of the Hebrew phrase is uncertain. Assuming that it refers to Jerusalem (see [22:5](https://ref.ly/Isa22:5)), it is ironic: Jerusalem sits atop a hill, and visions were not typically thought to originate in a *valley.* Similarly, Jerusalem was proud of its self\-perceived religious *vision*, but its inhabitants were spiritually blind (see [6:10](https://ref.ly/Isa6:10); [42:18](https://ref.ly/Isa42:18)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 22:1

## Isaiah 22:1–4 (id: 15995)

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 22:1–ISA 22:25

## Isaiah 22:2 (id: 16007)

The reveling city was full of feasting and drinking ([22:13](https://ref.ly/Isa22:13); see [23:7](https://ref.ly/Isa23:7); [32:13](https://ref.ly/Isa32:13)), probably in response to the Assyrian retreat. Now a new threat approaches—the Babylonian siege (586 BC). • The people died not in battle but by famine and disease. Siege warfare left the inhabitants of the city cut off from needed agricultural resources and in a terrible sanitation and health crisis.

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 22:2

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 22:8

## Isaiah 22:8–11 (id: 16014)

The inhabitants of Jerusalem planned for war by counting weapons, checking walls, and preparing a water supply. However, the people did not consider God’s plans (see [13:1–14:23](https://ref.ly/Isa13:1-Isa14:23)). Although Hezekiah was very prominent in these efforts, the second person verbs are plural. Isaiah was apparently not singling out Hezekiah, as he did Hezekiah’s father Ahaz ([7:1–4](https://ref.ly/Isa7:1-Isa7:4)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 22:8–ISA 22:11

## Isaiah 22:9 (id: 16016)

Jerusalem (literally *the city of David*): Calling Jerusalem “the city of David” evokes memories of Israel’s greatest king and God’s blessing upon him and the nation (see also [60:14](https://ref.ly/Isa60:14)). • You store up water in the lower pool: Hezekiah expended great energy in ensuring a constant supply of water (see[22:11](https://ref.ly/Isa22:11); [2 Kgs 20:20](https://ref.ly/2Kgs20:20)).

## Isaiah 22:14 (id: 15997)

you will never be forgiven for this sin: The people of Judah added sin upon sin to the point that God would justly condemn them. This foreshadowed the Exile; although it took place in 586 BC, Isaiah was already anticipating it in 701 BC.

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 22:14

## Isaiah 22:15 (id: 15999)

The actions of Shebna represent among the populace a lack of confidence in God’s ability to rescue Jerusalem from the Assyrian attack. • A palace administrator held the highest possible position in the royal court (see [22:21–22](https://ref.ly/Isa22:21-Isa22:22)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 22:15

## Isaiah 22:15–25 (id: 15998)

Shebna and Eliakim were two royal officials in King Hezekiah’s court (see [2 Kgs 18:18](https://ref.ly/2Kgs18:18); [19:2](https://ref.ly/2Kgs19:2)). Apparently assuming that death at the hands of the Assyrians was inevitable, Shebna planned for an ostentatious burial place ([Isa 22:16](https://ref.ly/Isa22:16)). Although the rebuke of Shebna preceded Assyria’s siege of Jerusalem in 701 BC (see [22:19–21](https://ref.ly/Isa22:19-Isa22:21); [36:3](https://ref.ly/Isa36:3)), it connects well with the admonitions of [22:1–13](https://ref.ly/Isa22:1-Isa22:13) regarding the ensuing Babylonian siege.

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 22:15–ISA 22:25

## Isaiah 23:1–18 (id: 16017)

Tyre was a prosperous seaport northwest of Israel. The relationship between Judah and Tyre went back to the time of David and Solomon ([1 Kgs 5:8–9](https://ref.ly/1Kgs5:8-1Kgs5:9)). Tyre, with its proximity to plentiful forests and to the Mediterranean Sea, was one of the commercial centers of the ancient Near East. Its fleets were renowned, and its colonies brought it great prestige and riches. The city came under repeated attack by the Assyrians, Babylonians, and Macedonians, and it fell to Alexander the Great in 332 BC. Isaiah not only prophesied the end of Tyre but by implication warned all whose wealth and earthly securities lead to pride instead of dependence on God (see [Isa 2:12–16](https://ref.ly/Isa2:12-Isa2:16); [Matt 11:21](https://ref.ly/Matt11:21)).

## Isaiah 23:4 (id: 16027)

Part of the great port city of Tyre was on an island. The island city was a fortress of the sea*,* but it fell in 332 BC. • I am childless; I have no sons or daughters: This metaphor was a judgment on Tyre’s colonial ports around the Mediterranean Sea. In the ancient world, to reach old age without having children was considered a terrible fate (see [49:21](https://ref.ly/Isa49:21); [54:1](https://ref.ly/Isa54:1)).

## Isaiah 24:1–27.13 (id: 16031)

This section is often referred to as the “Little Apocalypse” because of its similarities to the book of Revelation. In these chapters Isaiah takes readers out of the present into a vision of the future world. The universal imagery of the Little Apocalypse makes it difficult to assign the events described to any precise historical situation. That means that these chapters cannot be used to outline a sequence of events or create a historical blueprint for the future. Instead, the imagery is intended to create an impressionistic drama of an unfolding world that is both like and unlike the present. The combination of aspects of the old era with aspects of the new era (for instance, people of Zion will all be righteous \[new], but still long for their redemption \[old]) is consistent with the New Testament concept of the future age breaking into and overlapping with the present evil age ([2 Cor 4:4](https://ref.ly/2Cor4:4); [Gal 1:4](https://ref.ly/Gal1:4)). Peter, for example, wrote of believers as living in the last days ([1 Pet 1:12](https://ref.ly/1Pet1:12); [2 Pet 3:3](https://ref.ly/2Pet3:3)) even though the last day remains yet future ([2 Pet 3:10](https://ref.ly/2Pet3:10)).

earth . . . dries up . . . land wastes away and withers: The prophets often used the imagery of a drought to get the attention of people who live off the land (see also [Jer 23:10](https://ref.ly/Jer23:10); [Joel 1:12](https://ref.ly/Joel1:12); [Amos 1:2](https://ref.ly/Amos1:2)).

The wisdom of the people of Judah was not directed by God’s Spirit (cp. [11:2](https://ref.ly/Isa11:2)); instead, they had formed alliances that God did not approve of.

## Isaiah 30:12 (id: 16151)

## Isaiah 36:1 (id: 16233)

King Sennacherib of Assyria ruled from 705–681 BC. Hezekiah, like many other kings under Assyrian vassalage, had reasserted his independence when Sennacherib came to the throne in troubled circumstances. By 701 BC, the Assyrian king was ready to punish Hezekiah. Sennacherib recorded having conquered forty\-six fortified cities and many villages, and having taken 200,146 captives. Hezekiah responded by attempting to appease Sennacherib (see [2 Kgs 18:14–16](https://ref.ly/2Kgs18:14-2Kgs18:16)), but it was too late.

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 36:1

## Isaiah 36:1–39.8 (id: 16225)

Jerusalem’s rescue from King Sennacherib of Assyria is a focal point of chs [1–39](https://ref.ly/Isa1:1-Isa39:8). The Lord promised to rescue his people by remaining present with Jerusalem (see [7:14](https://ref.ly/Isa7:14)) and by maintaining a remnant (see study note on 10:20). Even though much of the country was desolate and the population decimated because of their foolish alliance with Assyria (chs [7–8](https://ref.ly/Isa7:1-Isa8:22)), the Lord preserved his people from total conquest through Hezekiah, a godly king. Hezekiah faced the same test that Ahaz did, a test of trust (note the recurrence of words for *trust* in the Assyrian officer’s challenge in ch [36](https://ref.ly/Isa36:1-Isa36:22)). But Hezekiah has learned the lessons taught in chs [13–35](https://ref.ly/Isa13:1-Isa35:10) and, at least initially, he passed the test. This narrative is duplicated in [2 Kgs 18:13–20:19](https://ref.ly/2Kgs18:13-2Kgs20:19).

Lachish was a city overlooking the low\-lying hills to the west of Jerusalem. It had to be taken before the final attack on Jerusalem could be launched. • the aqueduct that feeds water into the upper pool: This was a pool on the north side of Jerusalem, not the Gihon Spring in the Kidron valley. • Isaiah had met Ahaz on this same road leading to the field where cloth is washed some thirty\-three years earlier (see [Isa 7:3](https://ref.ly/Isa7:3)). At that time he had challenged Ahaz to trust God. However, Ahaz trusted Assyria instead, and this desperate situation was a result. Now the challenge to trust God came from mocking, foreign lips (see [28:11–13](https://ref.ly/Isa28:11-Isa28:13)).

The Assyrian chief of staff attempted to use intimidation to negotiate a settlement without bloodshed. In his first speech ([36:4–10](https://ref.ly/Isa36:4-Isa36:10)), he rightly argued against Egypt’s ability to rescue but wrongly charged Hezekiah with misplaced trust in the Lord.

Often his role was to communicate special messages (see [Gen 16:7–14](https://ref.ly/Gen16:7-Gen16:14)), but sometimes he brought judgment (see [2 Sam 24:16](https://ref.ly/2Sam24:16)). • killed 185,000 Assyrian soldiers: The Lord began to fulfill what he had repeatedly promised—rescue of Jerusalem and judgment of Assyria (see [Isa 10:16](https://ref.ly/Isa10:16), [33–34](https://ref.ly/Isa10:33-Isa10:34); [30:31](https://ref.ly/Isa30:31); [31:8](https://ref.ly/Isa31:8)).

## Isaiah 37:38 (id: 16261)

One day: Sennacherib was probably killed in 681 BC, about twenty years after his withdrawal from Jerusalem. • Esarhaddon was king of Assyria from 680–669 BC. It is ironic that Sennacherib, who mocked the Lord, was killed by his sons in the temple of his god.

## Isaiah 38:1 (id: 16272)

About that time (literally *in those days*): This is a very general time statement. Hezekiah’s illness and subsequent healing probably preceded Jerusalem’s rescue (chs [36–37](https://ref.ly/Isa36:1-Isa37:38)), even though Isaiah places it afterward. Merodach\-baladan’s reign in Babylon ([39:1](https://ref.ly/Isa39:1)) ended before Sennacherib’s invasion in 701 BC. The order in the text indicates a connection between these two events (see [38:6](https://ref.ly/Isa38:6)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 38:1

## Isaiah 38:1–9 (id: 16266)

The story of Hezekiah’s healing connects Hezekiah’s extension of life with Jerusalem’s relief from the Assyrians. The events of this story took place before Jerusalem’s rescue from the Assyrians but were placed in a thematic rather than chronological order. One theme is the importance of prayer (see [37:14–20](https://ref.ly/Isa37:14-Isa37:20); [38:2–3](https://ref.ly/Isa38:2-Isa38:3)). The Lord does listen! Hezekiah had learned the lesson of trust that his father, Ahaz, refused. As a result, Judah and Jerusalem were spared total destruction by the Assyrians. Yet Hezekiah was not the Messiah, the Son of David promised in [7:14](https://ref.ly/Isa7:14); [9:1–7](https://ref.ly/Isa9:1-Isa9:7); [11:1–16](https://ref.ly/Isa11:1-Isa11:16); [16:5](https://ref.ly/Isa16:5); [32:1](https://ref.ly/Isa32:1), [and 33:17–22](https://ref.ly/Isa33:17-Isa33:22). Thus, these accounts of his failure and mortality (chs [38–39](https://ref.ly/Isa38:1-Isa39:8)) prepare the reader for the revelation of the true Messiah that follows (chs [40–66](https://ref.ly/Isa40:1-Isa66:24)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 38:1–ISA 38:9

## Isaiah 38:3 (id: 16275)

I have always been faithful to you: Hezekiah’s heart was right with the Lord for most of his reign ([2 Kgs 18:1–5](https://ref.ly/2Kgs18:1-2Kgs18:5)), although his dependence on Egypt was a time of weakness when he did not act faithfully ([Isa 31:1–9](https://ref.ly/Isa31:1-Isa31:9)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 38:5

## Isaiah 38:6 (id: 16277)

I will rescue you . . . I will defend this city: This promise refers to the rescue of Jerusalem (chs [36–37](https://ref.ly/Isa36:1-Isa37:38)); it also provides a greater context for understanding Hezekiah’s sickness and healing. Just as Hezekiah received another fifteen years, Jerusalem also received a temporary reprieve (see ch [39](https://ref.ly/Isa39:1-Isa39:8)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 38:6

## Isaiah 38:9–20 (id: 16278)

Hezekiah’s poem contains both lament ([38:9–14](https://ref.ly/Isa38:9-Isa38:14)) and praise ([38:15–20](https://ref.ly/Isa38:15-Isa38:20)), although the praise is distinctly muted until the final verse.

## Isaiah 38:10 (id: 16267)

enter the place of the dead? (literally *enter the gates of Sheol?*): This image comes from an ancient idea that people enter death through gates (see [14:9](https://ref.ly/Isa14:9)). Old Testament believers did not understand the afterlife as the New Testament reveals it. It was a shadowy place where all the dead were together and where no praise of God existed (see [38:18](https://ref.ly/Isa38:18); [Pss 88:10](https://ref.ly/Ps88:10); [115:17](https://ref.ly/Ps115:17)).

## Isaiah 38:15 (id: 16270)

I will walk humbly: Hezekiah might have previously taken his life and good health for granted. Now he recognized that these gifts from the Lord can be withdrawn at any time.

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 38:15

## Isaiah 38:16 (id: 16271)

God’s restoration of Hezekiah’s health also symbolized the restoration from exile that Judah would experience in the future.

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 38:16

## Isaiah 38:21–22 (id: 16273)

Hezekiah received a sign, reminiscent of another sign the prophet had offered Ahaz ([7:11](https://ref.ly/Isa7:11)). Ahaz and Hezekiah were two bookends to a long story. Ahaz represented the ungodly king and Hezekiah the godly king. The former brought disaster on his people, while the latter rescued his people (but see ch [39](https://ref.ly/Isa39:1-Isa39:8)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 38:21–ISA 38:22

## Isaiah 38:22 (id: 16274)

Hezekiah could not go to the Temple with an infection (see [Lev 13](https://ref.ly/Lev13:1-Lev13:59)), so going to the Temple signifies restored health.

## Isaiah 39:1 (id: 16280)

Merodach\-baladan*,* the king of Babylon (722–710 and 704–703 BC), planned to rebel against Assyria and sought help from Hezekiah. His envoys visited after Hezekiah had been very sick and had recovered but before Sennacherib’s final attack in 701 BC.

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 39:1

## Isaiah 39:1–8 (id: 16279)

Hezekiah was exemplary in godliness, prayer, and care for the people of Jerusalem. But he failed the Lord by parading his financial and military strength before the envoys from Babylon.

## Isaiah 39:6–7 (id: 16282)

carried off to Babylon: This prophecy was given before the prophecy of the rescue of Jerusalem ([37:35](https://ref.ly/Isa37:35)). Although this pronouncement of judgment and exile comes as a surprise ending to the story of Hezekiah, the exile of both Israel and Judah had been in the background from the beginning ([10:3–4](https://ref.ly/Isa10:3-Isa10:4), [20–23](https://ref.ly/Isa10:20-Isa10:23)). The Lord had promised that he would spare Judah and Jerusalem when the Assyrians attacked in 701 BC, but he had clearly revealed to Isaiah that worse things would come if they did not change their ways. God had demonstrated the truth of his sovereignty and trustworthiness in his defeat of the Assyrians, but that did not mean the people had changed. The only way the promises of [2:1–5](https://ref.ly/Isa2:1-Isa2:5) and [4:2–6](https://ref.ly/Isa4:2-Isa4:6) were going to be realized was through the fires of judgment ([4:4](https://ref.ly/Isa4:4)). Until the burning coal of exile was applied to the nation’s unclean lips ([6:5–7](https://ref.ly/Isa6:5-Isa6:7)), their mission to the nations would fail.

## Isaiah 40:1–31 (id: 16290)

This chapter introduces chs [40–66](https://ref.ly/Isa40:1-Isa66:24). In this section, comfort refers to the result of God’s merciful way of dealing with people in the age to come. It includes encouragement, strength, and acceptance. God wants to rescue his people ([40:1–11](https://ref.ly/Isa40:1-Isa40:11)) and is more than able to do so ([40:12–26](https://ref.ly/Isa40:12-Isa40:26)). The exiles needed to believe God’s promises and wait on him for their rescue ([40:27–31](https://ref.ly/Isa40:27-Isa40:31); see also [30:15–18](https://ref.ly/Isa30:15-Isa30:18)).

## Isaiah 40:1–55.13 (id: 16291)

This section announces the good news of God’s coming salvation. The Lord is coming to vindicate his own and to judge his enemies. Salvation would be accomplished through the arrival, suffering, and exaltation of the Lord’s servant—the Messiah, Jesus Christ.

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 40:1–ISA 40:11

## Isaiah 40:1–66.24 (id: 16292)

The rest of Isaiah provides a message of comfort and a revelation of God’s character and his purposes for Israel. As [39:6–7](https://ref.ly/Isa39:6-Isa39:7) predicted, Judah would experience judgment and exile after the time of Isaiah. Throughout chs [40–66](https://ref.ly/Isa40:1-Isa66:24), Isaiah prophesied from the vantage point of the Exile having already become a reality. Therefore, the Babylonian exile provides the background for understanding these chapters.

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 40:1–ISA 40:2

## Isaiah 40:2 (id: 16310)

Speak tenderly: The prophet’s message was to encourage Jerusalem with the good news of God’s forgiveness, reconciliation, and restoration. • From the prophetic perspective, Israel’s sad days are gone because the Exile is over. • punished her twice over for all her sins: Israel experienced the full brunt of God’s wrath ([51:19–23](https://ref.ly/Isa51:19-Isa51:23); cp.

the voice of someone shouting: In [Mal 3:1](https://ref.ly/Mal3:1) this person (possibly the Elijah of [Mal 4:5](https://ref.ly/Mal4:5)) was God’s messenger who prepared the way for God’s coming. In the Gospels, this announcer was identified with John the Baptist ([Matt 3:3](https://ref.ly/Matt3:3); [Mark 1:3](https://ref.ly/Mark1:3); [Luke 3:4](https://ref.ly/Luke3:4); [John 1:23](https://ref.ly/John1:23)). • Clear the way . . . Make a straight highway: The announcer’s message would expedite God’s coming (see [Isa 35:8](https://ref.ly/Isa35:8)). As God made a way for Israel through the Red Sea ([43:16](https://ref.ly/Isa43:16)), so a way would be opened up for the Lord (see [52:11–12](https://ref.ly/Isa52:11-Isa52:12)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 40:3

## Isaiah 40:3–5 (id: 16311)

There is now a shift from the general announcement of the good news to the specific expectation of God’s coming. The good news ([40:1–2](https://ref.ly/Isa40:1-Isa40:2)) is grounded in God himself. Isaiah portrayed the Lord as coming on a highway through the desert (see ch [35](https://ref.ly/Isa35:1-Isa35:10)), although the imagery is here reversed: In ch [35](https://ref.ly/Isa35:1-Isa35:10), the people were traveling to Zion, toward the Lord. Here, the Lord is coming toward his people (see also [52:8](https://ref.ly/Isa52:8), where the two images are brought together).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 40:3–ISA 40:5

## Isaiah 40:5 (id: 16314)

The future revelation of God’s glory would include the return of Judah from exile but would also go beyond it. The New Testament confirmed that the revelation of God’s glory came in Jesus Christ ([John 1:14](https://ref.ly/John1:14); [Heb 1:3](https://ref.ly/Heb1:3)). • The Lord has spoken: The coming salvation and judgment would certainly occur because the Lord, who keeps his word, had declared it (see [Isa 1:20](https://ref.ly/Isa1:20); [58:14](https://ref.ly/Isa58:14)).

To whom . . . What image: Earlier in the book, idolatry was shown to be ridiculous ([16:12](https://ref.ly/Isa16:12); [37:16–19](https://ref.ly/Isa37:16-Isa37:19)). Chapters[40–48](https://ref.ly/Isa40:1-Isa48:22) open up a much more extensive argument against idolatry. Idols are symbolic representations of gods and, at times, other religious concepts. Those who worship them don’t recognize the implication that they are man\-made trinkets. Idols are powerless ([41:7](https://ref.ly/Isa41:7), [22–24](https://ref.ly/Isa41:22-Isa41:24); [48:14](https://ref.ly/Isa48:14)), give a false sense of security ([42:17](https://ref.ly/Isa42:17)), delude people ([44:20](https://ref.ly/Isa44:20)), and lead to severe disappointment ([42:17](https://ref.ly/Isa42:17); [45:16](https://ref.ly/Isa45:16), [20](https://ref.ly/Isa45:20)). They cannot help those who care for them. In fact, they are so weak that they fall down ([40:20](https://ref.ly/Isa40:20); [41:7](https://ref.ly/Isa41:7)). In the end, idols compete for God’s glory ([42:8](https://ref.ly/Isa42:8)) and take away human dignity ([44:9](https://ref.ly/Isa44:9); see also [41:21–29](https://ref.ly/Isa41:21-Isa41:29)). • The Lord, the true God, is incomparable (see [40:25](https://ref.ly/Isa40:25); [46:5](https://ref.ly/Isa46:5); [Pss 86:8](https://ref.ly/Ps86:8); [89:6](https://ref.ly/Ps89:6)); no one could resemble him.

God intended to rescue the Israelites from exile. However, the question remained: How could sinful Israel again become the servant of the Holy One? God would make a way for Israel’s sin to be atoned for and their fellowship with him to be restored. That way would be the promised servant, who would come for Israel and for all peoples.

The suffering servant would come out of Israel (see [41:8](https://ref.ly/Isa41:8)) and would himself be the true Israel.

beat me . . . pulled out my beard . . . mockery and spitting: These connections with the experience of Jesus at his crucifixion are too close to be coincidental—Jesus is the true suffering servant (see [Matt 27:27–31](https://ref.ly/Matt27:27-Matt27:31)).

## Isaiah 50:7 (id: 16482)

Externally, the servant would be disgraced and put to shame*,* but within himself he would calmly await God’s vindication (see [29:22](https://ref.ly/Isa29:22); [54:4](https://ref.ly/Isa54:4); [61:7](https://ref.ly/Isa61:7)). • set my face like a stone: The servant would be determined to do God’s will (see [Luke 9:51](https://ref.ly/Luke9:51)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 50:7

## Isaiah 50:8 (id: 16483)

He who gives me justice is near: God vindicates those who suffer for doing his will. Vindication is an act of God by which he exalts those who have been wrongly disgraced and strikes down the wicked, self\-exalted, and arrogant (see also [2 Thes 1:6–9](https://ref.ly/2Thess1:6-2Thess1:9)). • bring charges . . . my accusers: Confidence in God’s vindication removes fear and bolsters faith (see [Rom 8:31–34](https://ref.ly/Rom8:31-Rom8:34)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 50:8

## Isaiah 50:9 (id: 16484)

Who will declare me guilty? The implied answer to this rhetorical question is, “No one!” This answer foreshadows the New Testament understanding of justification (see [Rom 8:31–35](https://ref.ly/Rom8:31-Rom8:35)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 50:9

## Isaiah 50:10 (id: 16474)

The test of whether or not an individual fears the Lord is how he or she responds to God’s righteous servant. The same idea is present in Jesus’ claim that no one can come to the Father except through him ([John 14:6](https://ref.ly/John14:6)). • Those who trust in the Lord have great hope for the future (see [Isa 12:2](https://ref.ly/Isa12:2)).

## Isaiah 52:7–12 (id: 16517)

This is a poetic description of God’s promise to rescue his people from the alienation their sin created. The imagery is of a besieged city waiting for word that its hero has defeated the enemy armies. Paul applies these words to the proclamation of the Good News of the Lord Jesus ([Rom 10:15](https://ref.ly/Rom10:15)).

## Isaiah 52:11–12 (id: 16504)

This is an exhortation to leave the captivity of sin (see [48:20](https://ref.ly/Isa48:20) on leaving physical captivity in Babylon). See also [2 Cor 6:17](https://ref.ly/2Cor6:17); [2 Tim 2:19](https://ref.ly/2Tim2:19).

Isaiah drew this contrast to emphasize the newness of God’s plan. • protect you from behind: See [Exod 13:21](https://ref.ly/Exod13:21); [14:19–20](https://ref.ly/Exod14:19-Exod14:20).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 52:13

## Isaiah 52:13–53.12 (id: 16507)

This is the fourth of four passages that speak about the promised servant (see study note on 42:1–4). The Hebrew poem is carefully constructed in five three\-line stanzas. It begins with the servant’s exaltation ([52:13](https://ref.ly/Isa52:13)), proceeds to his humiliation ([52:14–53:9](https://ref.ly/Isa52:14-Isa53:9)), and ends with his exaltation ([53:10–12](https://ref.ly/Isa53:10-Isa53:12)). The faithful servant’s suffering would bring reconciliation between God and humans. The Lord Jesus perfectly fulfilled this prophecy (see ch [40](https://ref.ly/Isa40:1-Isa40:31); [Matt 8:17](https://ref.ly/Matt8:17); [Acts 8:30–35](https://ref.ly/Acts8:30-Acts8:35); [Rom 10:15–17](https://ref.ly/Rom10:15-Rom10:17); [15:21](https://ref.ly/Rom15:21); [1 Pet 2:24–25](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:24-1Pet2:25)).

## Isaiah 52:15 (id: 16511)

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 52:15

## Isaiah 53:1 (id: 16524)

our message: The identity of the speaker has been debated—the main possibilities are (1\) a faithful remnant of Israel, and (2\) Isaiah himself. Most likely, Isaiah the prophet was speaking for and with Israel. • powerful arm: God’s strength, so dramatically described in the previous chapters (see [50:2](https://ref.ly/Isa50:2); [51:5](https://ref.ly/Isa51:5), [9](https://ref.ly/Isa51:9); [52:10](https://ref.ly/Isa52:10)), would actually manifest itself in weakness and apparent helplessness through the servant’s humiliation and exaltation (see [1 Cor 1:27–30](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:27-1Cor1:30)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 53:1

## Isaiah 53:2 (id: 16525)

a tender green shoot . . . in dry ground: Such a plant is vulnerable to extinction (cp. [37:27](https://ref.ly/Isa37:27)). It can hardly stay alive for itself, let alone provide anything for anyone else. • nothing beautiful or majestic: The servant appeared to have no greatness or self\-evident royal splendor (see [52:13–15](https://ref.ly/Isa52:13-Isa52:15)). • nothing to attract us to him: People like their leaders to be physically attractive and personally charismatic. The servant would be neither.

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 53:2

## Isaiah 53:3 (id: 16526)

a man of sorrows, acquainted with deepest grief (or *a man of pains, acquainted with illness*): The servant would fully experience the effects of sin and the Fall. • we did not care: Because people would fail to see how such a weak, insignificant person could do anything beneficial for them, they would be unconcerned about his suffering.

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 53:3

## Isaiah 53:4 (id: 16527)

The callous world would assume that the servant somehow brought his suffering on himself, never realizing that he was suffering for them. • troubles . . . punishment: These descriptions of the servant’s humiliation contrast with the descriptions of his exaltation.

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 53:4

## Isaiah 53:5 (id: 16528)

he was pierced: See also [Zech 12:10](https://ref.ly/Zech12:10). • crushed . . . beaten . . . whipped: These were typically punishments for crimes. Sin is a crime against God. • be whole: Hebrew shalom, usually translated “peace.” *Shalom* means to experience wholeness in body, in mind, and in relationships with others. The servant would be injured so that humanity can be whole and healthy in all aspects of life (see also [Isa 57:18](https://ref.ly/Isa57:18)). We do not need to suffer divine condemnation for our sins because the servant has already done so (see [Gal 1:4](https://ref.ly/Gal1:4)).

## Isaiah 53:6 (id: 16529)

no wrong . . . never deceived anyone: See [1 Pet 2:21–25](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:21-1Pet2:25). • in a rich man’s grave: Literally *he was with the rich in his death* (see [Matt 27:57–61](https://ref.ly/Matt27:57-Matt27:61)). Although the Bible often considers riches as a blessing from God, it regularly condemns the rich as crooked and oppressive. The point here might be ironic: This good man would be buried with oppressors.

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 53:9

## Isaiah 53:10 (id: 16521)

The servant’s grief would accomplish a greater good; the forgiveness and reconciliation of sinful humanity. Note also God’s good plan to prosper and exalt the servant. • when his life is made an offering for sin: The suffering of the servant provided a substitute for others, just as the animal sacrifices in the Temple did. • Having many descendants and enjoying a long life are rewards for godly and wise living (see [Prov 3:2](https://ref.ly/Prov3:2); [17:6](https://ref.ly/Prov17:6); [20:7](https://ref.ly/Prov20:7)). Because the servant left his fate in his God’s hands, he would receive eternal rewards from the God who vindicates the righteous (see [Phil 2:9–11](https://ref.ly/Phil2:9-Phil2:11)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 53:10

## Isaiah 53:10–12 (id: 16520)

## Isaiah 53:11 (id: 16522)

his experience (literally *his knowledge*): This clearly does not refer to intellectual knowledge but to all that the servant would experience in his obedience, suffering, and intimate relationship with God. • The servant’s righteous obedience enables people to be put right with God (see [Gen 15:6](https://ref.ly/Gen15:6); [Rom 5:18–19](https://ref.ly/Rom5:18-Rom5:19)), for he will bear all their sins.

the honors: See [Phil 2:9–11](https://ref.ly/Phil2:9-Phil2:11). • He was counted among the rebels: *Rebels* (Hebrew poshe‘im) is a stronger word than *sinners* and is a key word in Isaiah. It refers to those who are in willful defiance of a lawful authority, in this case, God. • interceded for rebels: The servant would pray for sinners in the midst of his suffering (see [Exod 32:30](https://ref.ly/Exod32:30); [Luke 23:34](https://ref.ly/Luke23:34)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 53:12

## Isaiah 54:1 (id: 16544)

In the ancient world, a woman who had never given birth after being married for a time would be ashamed. Isaiah compares Jerusalem to a barren woman who rejoices at the long\-awaited blessing of children (see [Gal 4:27](https://ref.ly/Gal4:27)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 54:1

## Isaiah 54:1–3 (id: 16535)

The pain of separation would be brief compared to the depth of the renewal of love and compassion. • The Lord abandoned Israel in exile for a little while because of the people’s sins. • everlasting love: The Lord is eternally committed to his people, making the seventy\-year punishment of exile seem short indeed (see [25:1](https://ref.ly/Isa25:1); [Hos 2:1](https://ref.ly/Hos2:1)).

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 54:7–ISA 54:8

## Isaiah 54:9 (id: 16548)

The Exile was similar in both drama and trauma to the flood in the time of Noah. In both instances, people sinned grievously against the Lord, but the Lord renewed his commitment to creation (after Noah’s flood) and to his people (after the Exile).
