--------------------------------

## Romans 1:1 (id: 25536)

slave of Christ Jesus: The word *slave* is used of important Old Testament leaders of God’s people, such as Moses ([2 Kgs 18:12](https://ref.ly/2Kgs18:12)), Joshua ([Josh 24:29](https://ref.ly/Josh24:29)), Elijah ([2 Kgs 10:10](https://ref.ly/2Kgs10:10)), and David ([2 Sam 7:8](https://ref.ly/2Sam7:8)). The title underscores Paul’s complete subservience to Christ as Lord. • sent out (literally *set apart*): Paul may be alluding to being set apart by God for his mission before he was born, as the prophet Jeremiah was ([Jer 1:5](https://ref.ly/Jer1:5)). He may also be referring to God’s call at the time of his Damascus Road conversion ([Acts 9:15–16](https://ref.ly/Acts9:15-Acts9:16); cp. [Acts 13:2](https://ref.ly/Acts13:2)), to preach the Good News to Jews and especially to Gentiles. • The Good News, or “gospel,” is a recurrent topic in the opening of the letter ([Rom 1:1](https://ref.ly/Rom1:1), [9](https://ref.ly/Rom1:9), [15](https://ref.ly/Rom1:15), [16](https://ref.ly/Rom1:16)). Paul takes the word from the Old Testament, where the Hebrew equivalent refers to the victory that God wins for his people ([Isa 40:9](https://ref.ly/Isa40:9); [41:27](https://ref.ly/Isa41:27); [60:6](https://ref.ly/Isa60:6); [61:1](https://ref.ly/Isa61:1); [Nah 1:15](https://ref.ly/Nah1:15); see [Joel 2:32](https://ref.ly/Joel2:32)).

## Romans 1:1–17 (id: 25528)

These verses contain the normal features of New Testament letter introductions: an identification of the writer ([1:1–6](https://ref.ly/Rom1:1-Rom1:6)) and readers ([1:7](https://ref.ly/Rom1:7)), a thanksgiving ([1:8–15](https://ref.ly/Rom1:8-Rom1:15)), and the theme of the letter ([1:16–17](https://ref.ly/Rom1:16-Rom1:17)).

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 1:1–ROM 1:17

## Romans 1:3 (id: 25545)

In his earthly life (literally *As regards the flesh*): Paul often uses “flesh” (Greek sarx) to refer to bodily existence in this world (e.g., [4:1](https://ref.ly/Rom4:1); [8:3](https://ref.ly/Rom8:3)). • Paul refers to King David’s family line because God promised that a descendant of David would be the Messiah and would be given an eternal kingdom ([2 Sam 7:13–16](https://ref.ly/2Sam7:13-2Sam7:16); see [Isa 9:7](https://ref.ly/Isa9:7); [Jer 33:15](https://ref.ly/Jer33:15)). Jesus was born into David’s line ([Matt 1:6](https://ref.ly/Matt1:6); [Luke 1:27](https://ref.ly/Luke1:27), [32](https://ref.ly/Luke1:32)), so he was qualified to fulfill God’s promise.

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 1:3

## Romans 1:3–4 (id: 25543)

In the Greek, these verses are in carefully structured parallel form; Paul might be quoting an early Christian creed or hymn about Jesus Christ as God’s Son in order to establish common ground with the Roman Christians, whom he had never visited.

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 1:3–ROM 1:4

## Romans 1:4 (id: 25546)

he was shown to be: Although Jesus eternally existed as the Son of God ([1:3](https://ref.ly/Rom1:3)), his resurrection demonstrated him to be God’s Son, revealing him in all his power and glory.

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 1:4

## Romans 1:5 (id: 25547)

given us . . . apostles: Here Paul might have been thinking both of himself and of the other apostles, or he might be using an editorial plural to refer only to himself. • Privilege and authority could specify two separate things, but one might explain the other, as in the privilege of having apostolic authority. Paul always makes it clear that his distinctive authority is a gift from God (see also [15:15–16](https://ref.ly/Rom15:15-Rom15:16)). • so that they will believe and obey him: This summary of Paul’s purpose in preaching to Gentiles brackets the book of Romans, as he repeats the same idea in slightly different language at the end of the letter ([16:26](https://ref.ly/Rom16:26)). Paul wanted Gentiles to believe in Jesus Christ; he underscored that believing in Jesus Christ as the Lord entails a commitment to obey him. Faith and obedience are not identical, but one does not occur without the other.

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 1:5

## Romans 1:7 (id: 25548)

To be holy means to be set apart for God. This expression is used throughout the Old Testament to describe Israel, God’s chosen people (cp. [Exod 19:6](https://ref.ly/Exod19:6)), whom God called from among all other nations to be his own. By calling the Gentile Christians his own holy people*,* Paul makes it clear that Gentiles are now fully included among God’s people.

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 1:7

## Romans 1:9 (id: 25549)

When Paul uses the phrase with all my heart (or *in my spirit*), he might be describing the influence of God’s Holy Spirit on his own inner person. The word *spirit* also refers to the deepest part of a person, which the phrase *all my heart* expresses well.

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 1:9

## Romans 1:11 (id: 25529)

some spiritual gift: Paul is probably referring to the spiritual benefit that he hopes his ministry will bring to the Roman Christians.

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 1:11

## Romans 1:13 (id: 25530)

brothers and sisters: This Greek word (adelphoi) describes people who are in a familial relationship. Paul and other New Testament writers use this word to indicate that Christians are so intimately tied to one another in Christ that they are family. The word refers to both male and female Christians. • I was prevented until now: Paul wrote this letter when he was in Corinth toward the end of his third missionary journey (see [Acts 20:2–4](https://ref.ly/Acts20:2-Acts20:4); cp. [Rom 16:21–23](https://ref.ly/Rom16:21-Rom16:23)). The need to plant and nourish churches in the eastern Mediterranean had occupied Paul up to this point. Before he could visit the Roman Christians, he first needed to return to Jerusalem to deliver a gift of money collected from the Gentile churches for the impoverished Jewish Christians ([15:23–29](https://ref.ly/Rom15:23-Rom15:29)).

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 1:13

## Romans 1:14 (id: 25531)

to people in both the civilized world and the rest of the world (literally *to Greeks and barbarians*): The Greeks prided themselves on being sophisticated and cultured, while regarding people from other cultures as inferior. They mocked other peoples’ poorly spoken Greek, claiming that they could only say “bar bar,” a nonsense phrase from which our word *barbarian* comes. Paul uses this cultural divide to emphasize his intention to preach the Good News to all kinds of people.

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 1:14

## Romans 1:16 (id: 25532)

The apostle Paul often emphasizes that the *gospel* (the good news about Jesus) is for *everyone*. He also insists that God first chose the Jews to be his people. God made promises to them and gave them a unique role in his continuing plan ([3:1–8](https://ref.ly/Rom3:1-Rom3:8); [9:1–5](https://ref.ly/Rom9:1-Rom9:5)). They have a special responsibility to respond to the gospel. They will experience God's judgment first if they reject the gospel ([2:9–10](https://ref.ly/Rom2:9-Rom2:10)).

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 1:16

## Romans 1:17 (id: 25533)

how God makes us right in his sight (literally *the righteousness of God*): This key phrase appears eight times in Romans (see also [3:5](https://ref.ly/Rom3:5), [21](https://ref.ly/Rom3:21), [22](https://ref.ly/Rom3:22), [25](https://ref.ly/Rom3:25), [26](https://ref.ly/Rom3:26); [10:3](https://ref.ly/Rom10:3); the only other occurrence in Paul’s writings is [2 Cor 5:21](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:21)). The expression has Old Testament roots, where God’s righteousness refers to his character (as holy or faithful) or to an act of declaring his people sinless and perfect in his eyes (see especially [Isa 46:13](https://ref.ly/Isa46:13); [51:5–8](https://ref.ly/Isa51:5-Isa51:8)). Paul uses the second meaning in this verse. The Good News has the power to save because it is the fulfillment of God’s promise to vindicate his people. • The phrase makes us right comes from the law court. It does not mean “makes us good people”; it means “puts us in right standing before God.” • “It is through faith that a righteous person has life”: The prophet Habakkuk had struggled to understand how God could use pagan nations to judge his own people Israel. God reminded Habakkuk that his true people—the *righteous*—need to live by faith ([Hab 2:4](https://ref.ly/Hab2:4)). In [Rom 1–4](https://ref.ly/Rom1:1-Rom4:25), Paul repeatedly insists that only through faith can human beings be made right in God’s sight.

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 1:17

## Romans 1:18 (id: 25535)

God’s anger is not a spontaneous emotional outburst, but the holy God’s necessary response to sin. The Old Testament often depicts God’s anger ([Exod 32:10–12](https://ref.ly/Exod32:10-Exod32:12); [Num 11:1](https://ref.ly/Num11:1); [Jer 21:3–7](https://ref.ly/Jer21:3-Jer21:7)) and predicts a decisive outpouring of God’s wrath on human sin at the end of history. While Paul usually depicts God’s anger as occurring in the end times ([Rom 2:5](https://ref.ly/Rom2:5), [8](https://ref.ly/Rom2:8); [5:9](https://ref.ly/Rom5:9); [Col 3:6](https://ref.ly/Col3:6); [1 Thes 1:10](https://ref.ly/1Thess1:10)), the present tense of shows refers to God’s expressions of anger throughout human history.

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 1:18

## Romans 1:18–3.20 (id: 25534)

Paul delays exploring the theme of righteousness through faith (see [3:21](https://ref.ly/Rom3:21)) until after he first teaches about universal sinfulness. Gentiles ([1:18–32](https://ref.ly/Rom1:18-Rom1:32)) and Jews ([2:1–3:8](https://ref.ly/Rom2:1-Rom3:8)) are equally under sin’s power and cannot find favor with God by any action of their own ([3:9–20](https://ref.ly/Rom3:9-Rom3:20)).

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 1:18–ROM 3:20

## Romans 1:21 (id: 25537)

To *know God* in Scripture usually means to have an intimate, saving relationship with him (see [2 Cor 5:16](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:16); [Gal 4:9](https://ref.ly/Gal4:9); [Phil 3:8](https://ref.ly/Phil3:8), [10](https://ref.ly/Phil3:10)). Here, however, they knew God means that people knew about God. All people have some understanding of God through creation, yet they do not do what is right based on that knowledge. Rather than learn more about God, they worship gods of their own making.

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 1:21

## Romans 1:24 (id: 25538)

When people replaced the living God with idols (false gods), God abandoned them. Paul emphasizes this point twice more in this paragraph ([1:26](https://ref.ly/Rom1:26), [28](https://ref.ly/Rom1:28)). The phrase *gave them over* suggests that God actively allows people to experience the consequences of their sin.

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 1:24

## Romans 1:26 (id: 25539)

women turned against the natural way: In this context, *natural way* refers to the nature of the world as God made it. As in the Old Testament, Paul singles out homosexuality as a key illustration of how people have fallen away from worship of the true God (see [Gen 19:1–28](https://ref.ly/Gen19:1-Gen19:28); [Lev 18:22](https://ref.ly/Lev18:22); [20:13](https://ref.ly/Lev20:13); [Deut 23:17–18](https://ref.ly/Deut23:17-Deut23:18)). God created human beings as male and female, and engaging in homosexual activity is a violation of God’s creative intention.

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 1:26

## Romans 1:27 (id: 25540)

suffered within themselves the penalty they deserved: When people abandon the Creator’s intentions, they are judged for their actions. This judgment can take many different forms, but the ultimate consequence is spiritual death (see [1:32](https://ref.ly/Rom1:32)).

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 1:27

## Romans 1:28 (id: 25541)

thought it foolish: Sin affects our actions and even our thoughts. One of the serious consequences of turning away from God is an unsound mind; people can no longer use their minds as God intended.

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 1:28

## Romans 1:29–31 (id: 25542)

This list of sins follows a popular Hellenistic literary form called a *vice list.* While not exhaustive, it reminds readers of various forms that evil might take.

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 1:29–ROM 1:31

## Romans 1:32 (id: 25544)

To encourage others to sin is worse than sinning oneself ([Jas 3:1](https://ref.ly/Jas3:1); cp. *Testament of Asher* 6:2: “The two\-faced are doubly punished because they both practice evil and approve of others who practice it; they imitate the spirits of error and join in the struggle against mankind”).

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 1:32

## Romans 2:1–5 (id: 25655)

You is singular in the Greek. Here, the *you* is a hypothetical complacent Jew, who feels superior to Gentiles and in no danger of judgment. Paul adopts a popular Hellenistic style called a *diatribe,* in which a writer tries to win over an audience to his views by portraying a debate between himself and a hypothetical opponent. • these very same things: Paul’s point is that Jews, like Gentiles, turn from God’s revelation to go their own way.

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 2:1–ROM 2:5

## Romans 2:4 (id: 25667)

Can’t you see that his kindness is intended to turn you from your sin? Behind Paul’s question are Jewish passages (e.g., *Wisdom of Solomon* 12–15; cp. [Jer 7:1–5](https://ref.ly/Jer7:1-Jer7:5); [Amos 5:18–27](https://ref.ly/Amos5:18-Amos5:27)) that portray a prevalent Jewish complacency toward judgment. Many Jews thought that because they were God’s people, they did not need to worry about judgment, for their sins would not be punished as the sins of Gentiles would be. Paul emphasizes that God’s grace was intended to turn the Jews from their sin, not to condone a sinful lifestyle.

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 2:4

## Romans 2:6–11 (id: 25668)

Paul uses a *chiasm* (“X” arrangement) to make his point:

A God judges everyone the same ([2:6](https://ref.ly/Rom2:6))

B Life is the reward for doing good ([2:7](https://ref.ly/Rom2:7))

C Wrath is the penalty for evil ([2:8](https://ref.ly/Rom2:8))

C′ Wrath for doing evil ([2:9](https://ref.ly/Rom2:9))

B′ Life for doing good ([2:10](https://ref.ly/Rom2:10))

A′ God shows no favoritism ([2:11](https://ref.ly/Rom2:11))

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 2:6–ROM 2:11

## Romans 2:7 (id: 25669)

He will give eternal life to those who keep on doing good: Paul makes it clear elsewhere that no one can receive eternal life except as God’s gift through faith ([3:20](https://ref.ly/Rom3:20), [28](https://ref.ly/Rom3:28); [4:1–8](https://ref.ly/Rom4:1-Rom4:8)). Here, Paul is either referring to Christians whose good deeds (that result from faith) will be taken into account in God’s judgment, or he is reminding readers of the absolute standard that God’s own holiness establishes, since only by perfection can sinners hope to find acceptance before God. As the argument of the letter unfolds, Paul will show that no one is capable of meeting that standard.

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 2:7

## Romans 2:8 (id: 25670)

Live for themselves translates a rare Greek word (eritheia) that seems to convey the idea of selfish ambition or strife. Using this word, Aristotle scolded the politicians of his day for seeking public office for selfish gain rather than from a desire to serve the people (Aristotle, *Politics* 5\.3; see also [2 Cor 12:20](https://ref.ly/2Cor12:20); [Gal 5:20](https://ref.ly/Gal5:20); [Phil 1:17](https://ref.ly/Phil1:17); [2:3](https://ref.ly/Phil2:3); [Jas 3:14](https://ref.ly/Jas3:14), [16](https://ref.ly/Jas3:16)).

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 2:8

## Romans 2:12 (id: 25656)

destroyed: This common New Testament word describes the fate of the wicked after death (see also [9:22](https://ref.ly/Rom9:22); [14:15](https://ref.ly/Rom14:15); [1 Cor 1:18](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:18); [15:18](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:18); [2 Cor 2:15](https://ref.ly/2Cor2:15); [4:3](https://ref.ly/2Cor4:3); [Phil 1:28](https://ref.ly/Phil1:28); [3:19](https://ref.ly/Phil3:19); [2 Thes 2:10](https://ref.ly/2Thess2:10); [1 Tim 6:9](https://ref.ly/1Tim6:9)). Condemned sinners do not cease to exist, but they suffer eternal punishment, which includes the everlasting destruction of all good in their identity and experience. • the Jews, who do have God’s law: The Jews were given the law of Moses, while the Gentiles never had God’s written law. In the New Testament period, Jews emphasized their possession of the law as a mark of God’s favor and even as a guarantee of salvation.

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 2:12

## Romans 2:13 (id: 25657)

obeying the law . . . makes us right in his sight: Regarding the promise of righteousness through obedience, see [2:7](https://ref.ly/Rom2:7); see also [Jas 1:22](https://ref.ly/Jas1:22).

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 2:13

## Romans 2:14–15 (id: 25658)

The Gentiles who know his law when they instinctively obey it may be Gentile Christians, especially since written in their hearts ([2:15](https://ref.ly/Rom2:15)) alludes to the prophecy of the new covenant ([Jer 31:31–34](https://ref.ly/Jer31:31-Jer31:34)). Or they could be non\-Christian Gentiles who know God’s general moral law through their consciences. In this case, Paul would be using the notion of *natural law* to show how all people could be held accountable for certain basic moral requirements.

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 2:14–ROM 2:15

## Romans 2:16 (id: 25659)

secret life (literally *the hidden things*): Scripture frequently stresses that God will judge people according to their thoughts and intentions (see [1 Sam 16:7](https://ref.ly/1Sam16:7); [Ps 139:1–2](https://ref.ly/Ps139:1-Ps139:2); [Jer 17:10](https://ref.ly/Jer17:10)).

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 2:16

## Romans 2:17–20 (id: 25660)

The boasting of the Jews reflects Old Testament and Jewish teaching about the privileges and responsibilities God gave to Israel. God gave his law to Israel, entered into a special relationship with them, and commissioned them to be a light to the Gentiles (see [Isa 42:6–7](https://ref.ly/Isa42:6-Isa42:7)). Jews were not wrong to enjoy these blessings; their error was in failing to live up to their privileged position.

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 2:17–ROM 2:20

## Romans 2:21–22 (id: 25661)

Paul again uses the diatribe style to expose the inconsistency of Jewish claims (see study note on 2:1–5).

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 2:21–ROM 2:22
* **Associated Articles:** Romans 2:1-5 (ID: `25655@TyndaleStudyNotes`)

## Romans 2:22 (id: 25662)

do you use items stolen from pagan temples? Old Testament law prohibited Jews from having anything to do with pagan idols (see [Deut 7:26](https://ref.ly/Deut7:26)), but first\-century Jews did not strictly follow this law. Sometimes they stole idols and used or sold the precious metals.

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 2:22

## Romans 2:24 (id: 25663)

Paul quotes [Isa 52:5](https://ref.ly/Isa52:5), where God’s name is blasphemed because Israel is oppressed by pagan nations. Here, Paul uses that passage to demonstrate the failure of the Jews to live up to their responsibilities.

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 2:24

## Romans 2:25 (id: 25664)

God instituted the Jewish ceremony of circumcision as a sign of his covenant with Abraham; it was to be performed on every male Israelite child ([Gen 17:9–13](https://ref.ly/Gen17:9-Gen17:13); see [Rom 4:11](https://ref.ly/Rom4:11)). Circumcision therefore represents God’s covenant with his people Israel. The rite took on greater significance during the intertestamental period when the pagan king Antiochus IV Epiphanes tried to stamp out the Jewish faith by forbidding circumcision and other Jewish practices. The Jews resisted in the famous Maccabean Revolt (166–160 BC). After they restored the worship of the Lord in Israel, the Jews regarded circumcision as a highly prized mark of Jewish loyalty in the midst of a pagan culture.

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 2:25

## Romans 2:26 (id: 25665)

won’t God declare them to be his own people? Paul might be speaking of Gentile Christians who are God’s people because they obey God’s law, or he could be speaking hypothetically about what would happen if a Gentile perfectly obeyed God’s law.

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 2:26

## Romans 2:29 (id: 25666)

The letter of the law refers to the law of God written on tablets of stone (see [2 Cor 3:3](https://ref.ly/2Cor3:3)), while the Spirit now writes his law on people’s hearts ([Jer 31:33–34](https://ref.ly/Jer31:33-Jer31:34)). Outward conformity is thus contrasted with obedience motivated by a change of heart.

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 2:29

## Romans 3:1 (id: 25677)

what’s the advantage of being a Jew? Paul moves his argument along by raising questions. After preaching the Good News for over twenty years, he knew what questions people would ask when they heard a particular teaching. His emphasis on the equality of Jews and Gentiles before God (ch [2](https://ref.ly/Rom2:1-Rom2:29)) inevitably led people to ask whether he was eliminating all Jewish privileges. The question\-and\-answer style follows the pattern of the diatribe (see study note on 2:1–5).

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 3:1
* **Associated Articles:** Romans 2:1-5 (ID: `25655@TyndaleStudyNotes`)

## Romans 3:2 (id: 25684)

The advantage that Jews possessed was in having received God’s word. • First of all: Paul never adds a second or a third point to the list he begins here. He might have forgotten to continue the list, or *first of all* might mean “most importantly.” However, [9:4–5](https://ref.ly/Rom9:4-Rom9:5) provides a good indication of what a list of Jewish privileges would have included. • By using the word revelation (Greek logia, “oracles, messages”), Paul highlights God’s personal communication with his people (see [Deut 33:9](https://ref.ly/Deut33:9); [Ps 105:19](https://ref.ly/Ps105:19)) through which he gives them special privileges and responsibilities.

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 3:2

## Romans 3:4 (id: 25686)

Of course not! The Greek mē genoito is an emphatic negation, popular in the diatribe style that Paul uses here and in several other passages in Romans (see [3:6](https://ref.ly/Rom3:6), [31](https://ref.ly/Rom3:31); [6:2](https://ref.ly/Rom6:2), [15](https://ref.ly/Rom6:15); [7:7](https://ref.ly/Rom7:7), [13](https://ref.ly/Rom7:13); [9:14](https://ref.ly/Rom9:14); [11:1](https://ref.ly/Rom11:1), [11](https://ref.ly/Rom11:11)). • As the Scriptures say: Paul quotes [Ps 51:4](https://ref.ly/Ps51:4), where David confessed his sin in having an adulterous relationship with Bathsheba (see [2 Sam 11:1–27](https://ref.ly/2Sam11:1-2Sam11:27)). God punished David, and David admitted that God was proved right and would win his case in court—his punishment was entirely just. God is faithful to what he has said in the past—his entire revelation—and his words warn of punishment for sin even as they promise reward for obedience.

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 3:4

## Romans 3:5–7 (id: 25687)

how would he be qualified to judge the world? Abraham asked a similar question: “Should not the Judge of all the earth do what is right?” ([Gen 18:25](https://ref.ly/Gen18:25)). God punishes all sin, and he retains absolute righteousness as he does so. Even when God makes use of human sin for his own ends, that sin still deserves to be, and will be, punished (see [Rom 9:10–24](https://ref.ly/Rom9:10-Rom9:24)).

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 3:5–ROM 3:7

## Romans 3:8 (id: 25688)

some people even slander us: Paul is referring to misrepresentations about his teaching on justification by faith. If a person is made right with God by faith alone, through God’s grace and apart from works, it could seem as if the Good News allows believers to sin because their sin is forgiven when confessed (see [6:1](https://ref.ly/Rom6:1)). One of Paul’s purposes is to help the Roman Christians understand that such misunderstandings are without basis.

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 3:8

## Romans 3:9 (id: 25689)

No, not at all: Paul’s emphatic answer does not contradict his claim in [3:1–2](https://ref.ly/Rom3:1-Rom3:2) that Jews have an advantage. But that advantage has not done them any good because they have disobeyed God’s word and incurred God’s punishment. Jews, like Gentiles, have sinned against the revelation of God and stand condemned. • under the power of sin (literally *under sin*): Being “under” something carries the sense of being under its power. The ultimate problem of human beings is not the fact of sin, but the situation of being slaves to sin. The solution to this problem requires the liberation provided in Christ Jesus, who frees us from both the penalty and the power of sin.

Paul speaks of the entire Old Testament as the law (see also [1 Cor 9:8](https://ref.ly/1Cor9:8), [9](https://ref.ly/1Cor9:9); [14:21](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:21), [34](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:34); [Gal 4:21](https://ref.ly/Gal4:21)). • Those to whom it was given (literally *those in the law*) were the Jews, who were given the Scriptures. • How can Paul conclude that the entire world is guilty before God on the basis of evidence from the Old Testament that Jews are sinful? He argues from the greater to the lesser, a standard Jewish rhetorical technique: If the law shows that the Jews, God’s own people, are guilty, then how much more are the Gentiles, who have not had the benefit of God’s instruction, also guilty.

## Romans 3:21–22 (id: 25679)

After a lengthy reminder of the power of sin ([1:18–3:20](https://ref.ly/Rom1:18-Rom3:20)), Paul returns to the theme presented in [1:17](https://ref.ly/Rom1:17), the way to be made right with God (literally *the righteousness of God*). As in that verse, “the righteousness of God” is the way that God puts people in right relationship with himself. • without keeping the requirements of the law (literally *apart from the law*): The old covenant looked forward to the climactic revelation of God’s righteousness in his Son. Because of what God has accomplished for us in Christ by completely fulfilling the requirements of the law, we are now able to come to him by faith, apart from the covenant structure set up by the law of Moses (cp. [Heb 8:13](https://ref.ly/Heb8:13)).

Paul returns to the central theme of the righteousness of God that is revealed in Christ and is available to anyone who believes. The fundamental statement of this theology is in [3:21–26](https://ref.ly/Rom3:21-Rom3:26); Paul elaborates on it in [3:27–31](https://ref.ly/Rom3:27-Rom3:31) and illustrates it with the experience of Abraham in ch [4](https://ref.ly/Rom4:1-Rom4:25).

God, in his grace: God makes us right in his sight*,* not because he has to, but because he has freely chosen to give us his favor through Christ Jesus. Because we are helpless slaves of sin ([3:9](https://ref.ly/Rom3:9)), our righteous status before God can never be earned (see [4:4–5](https://ref.ly/Rom4:4-Rom4:5)). • through Christ Jesus when he freed us from the penalty for our sins (literally *through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus*): In Paul’s day, *redemption* referred to the price paid to free a slave. God paid our redemption price with the blood of his own Son to rescue us from our slavery to sin (see [3:9](https://ref.ly/Rom3:9)). This language was used in the Old Testament to refer to the Exodus, the first redemption of God’s people from bondage (see [2 Sam 7:23](https://ref.ly/2Sam7:23)). God promised that he would again redeem his people ([Hos 13:14](https://ref.ly/Hos13:14); [Mic 4:10](https://ref.ly/Mic4:10)).

the sacrifice for sin (Greek hilastērion): This Greek word is used in the Greek Old Testament to refer to the “atonement cover,” the cover that rested on the Ark of the Covenant in the inner sanctuary of the Tabernacle. The atonement cover was prominent in the Day of Atonement ritual ([Lev 16](https://ref.ly/Lev16:1-Lev16:34)) and came to stand for the atonement ceremony itself. Paul characterizes Jesus Christ as God’s provision of final atonement for his people. Jesus himself satisfies, or absorbs in himself, the anger of God against all sinful people (see [Rom 1:18](https://ref.ly/Rom1:18)). • those who sinned in times past: Paul refers to righteous Old Testament people who were not punished for their sins as strict justice would require. Hebrews reminds us, “it is not possible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins” ([Heb 10:4](https://ref.ly/Heb10:4)). How, then, could God forgive people in the Old Testament? Paul answers that Jesus’ sacrifice works backward in history as well as forward—through Christ, God provided for the full satisfaction of his righteous anger against human sin.

Paul uses the foundational Jewish commitment to monotheism to argue for universal access to God’s forgiveness. If there is only one God*,* then he is equally the God of both Jews and Gentiles. All people must be able to come to God on the same terms, through faith.

## Romans 3:31 (id: 25685)

we truly fulfill the law: Paul knows that some people will object to his insistence on faith apart from the law because it seems to dismiss the demands of the law. However, faith actually enables people to fulfill the law. The Holy Spirit is given to those who have faith, and he makes it possible for people to do as they should.

## Romans 4:1 (id: 25696)

Jews in Paul’s day revered Abraham as Israel’s founder. Some Jewish texts claim that Abraham never sinned (*Prayer of Manasseh* 8; *Jubilees* 23:10\). Others emphasize his obedience to the law of Moses as the basis for his relationship with God (*1 Maccabees* 2:52; *Sirach* 44:19–20\). However, Paul demonstrates that Abraham’s faith, not his obedience, established his status with God. Abraham’s position as the founder of God’s people demonstrates that justification by faith is central in God’s plan.

Paul quotes [Gen 15:6](https://ref.ly/Gen15:6). In response to God’s promise that he would have descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky, Abraham believed God.

The logic of these verses is as follows: (1\) The stated premise is that when people work*,* their pay is what they have earned*,* not a gift. (2\) The unstated premise is that God is never indebted to his creatures (because they owe him everything), so anything he gives them is a gift (see also [9:14–16](https://ref.ly/Rom9:14-Rom9:16)). (3\) The conclusion is that therefore, people cannot be declared righteous before God because of their works.

This quotation from [Ps 32:1–2](https://ref.ly/Ps32:1-Ps32:2) follows the Jewish custom of supporting a reference to the Law with a reference in the Prophets or the Writings.

## Romans 4:10 (id: 25690)

God accepted Abraham before he was circumcised! Paul’s point is simple: God’s declaration of Abraham’s righteousness in [Gen 15:6](https://ref.ly/Gen15:6) could not have been based on his circumcision, which happened later ([Gen 17](https://ref.ly/Gen17:1-Gen17:27)). This point further demonstrates that God’s acceptance and blessing is a free gift and not earned by works.

## Romans 4:11–12 (id: 25691)

When God instituted circumcision, he called it “a sign of the covenant” between himself and Abraham ([Gen 17:11](https://ref.ly/Gen17:11)). The covenant was already in place ([Gen 12:1–3](https://ref.ly/Gen12:1-Gen12:3); [15:1–21](https://ref.ly/Gen15:1-Gen15:21); [17:1–8](https://ref.ly/Gen17:1-Gen17:8)) even before Abraham was circumcised ([Gen 17:9–14](https://ref.ly/Gen17:9-Gen17:14)). This shows that the covenant was based on faith, not circumcision. So Abraham is the spiritual father of all people, whether circumcised (Jews) or uncircumcised (Gentiles), who have the same kind of faith Abraham had—that is, faith in God’s promises ([Rom 4:13–25](https://ref.ly/Rom4:13-Rom4:25)).

## Romans 4:15 (id: 25694)

The only way to avoid breaking the law is to have no law to break! (literally *where there is no law, neither is there transgression*): Paul always uses the word “transgression” to denote disobedience of a clear commandment of God (see also [2:23](https://ref.ly/Rom2:23); [5:14](https://ref.ly/Rom5:14); [Gal 3:19](https://ref.ly/Gal3:19); [1 Tim 2:14](https://ref.ly/1Tim2:14)). Transgression only exists where the law exists, which is why the law always brings punishment. The law that God gave to the Israelites specified requirements in great detail, which made the people more accountable for sin than before. So when they inevitably disobeyed the law, God brought more severe punishment upon them.

Paul now turns from the Good News about how people enter a relationship with God to the security of that relationship. Christians have a strong and unassailable promise because of God’s work in Christ, God’s love for them, and the power of the Holy Spirit. This theme frames the teaching of these chapters ([5:1–11](https://ref.ly/Rom5:1-Rom5:11); [8:18–39](https://ref.ly/Rom8:18-Rom8:39)) as Paul grounds that promise in the transfer of believers from the realm of Adam to the realm of Christ ([5:12–21](https://ref.ly/Rom5:12-Rom5:21)). No power—whether sin (ch [6](https://ref.ly/Rom6:1-Rom6:23)), the law (ch [7](https://ref.ly/Rom7:1-Rom7:25)), or death ([8:1–13](https://ref.ly/Rom8:1-Rom8:13))—“will ever be able to separate us from the love of God” ([8:39](https://ref.ly/Rom8:39)).

undeserved privilege (or *grace*): So basic is God’s grace (Greek charis) that Paul can use the word to sum up our present situation as believers. • Where we now stand indicates that God’s grace is needed throughout the Christian life, not just at the beginning. • Sharing God’s glory describes the content of Christian hope, which Paul introduces here and expounds more fully in [8:18–30](https://ref.ly/Rom8:18-Rom8:30). Behind Paul’s use of the word *glory* (Greek doxa) is the Hebrew word kabod*,* which depicts God’s majesty and overwhelming presence. The prophets predict a day when God’s glory will return to dwell in the midst of his people (see, e.g., [Isa 60:1–2](https://ref.ly/Isa60:1-Isa60:2)).

Adam is both the name of the original man, Adam, and a Hebrew word that means “human.” Paul emphasizes the solidarity of Adam with the human race. • sin entered the world: The significance that Paul ascribes to this act, and the parallel that he draws between Adam’s sin and Christ’s act of obedience on the cross, makes clear that Paul views Adam and his sin in the Garden of Eden as historical fact. • everyone sinned: Death is universal because sin is universal. It is not clear when or how everyone sinned, but Paul later attributes the condemnation of all people to the sin of Adam, their representative ([5:18](https://ref.ly/Rom5:18)). • Jewish tradition is divided on the relationship between Adam’s sin and the sin and death of human beings generally. Some texts emphasize a solidarity between Adam and all other people, as in “when Adam sinned a death was decreed against those who were to be born” (*2 Baruch* 23:4\). Other texts insist that people die because of their own sin: “Adam is, therefore, not the cause, except only for himself, but each of us had become our own Adam” (*2 Baruch* 54:19\).

Paul continues his explanation of “everyone sinned” ([5:12](https://ref.ly/Rom5:12)) by stating that people who died between the times of Adam and Moses were not subject to specific commandments from God.

## Romans 6:2 (id: 25723)

we have died to sin: As Paul makes clear in [6:3–10](https://ref.ly/Rom6:3-Rom6:10), our new relationship to sin is possible because of our vital connection with the death of Jesus. Just as dying means entrance into an entirely new state of being, our relationship with sin is now different because of Christ’s death. To be “dead to sin” does not mean to be entirely insensitive to sin and temptation—believers are still involved in a battle with sin ([6:12–14](https://ref.ly/Rom6:12-Rom6:14)). However, Christians no longer have to live as helpless slaves to sin; they can choose not to sin ([6:6](https://ref.ly/Rom6:6), [14](https://ref.ly/Rom6:14), [16–22](https://ref.ly/Rom6:16-Rom6:22)).

From God’s perspective, Jesus’ death to sin (see [6:10](https://ref.ly/Rom6:10)) is ours as well.

But as people who are now in Christ, we have gone through crucifixion with him (see also [Gal 2:20](https://ref.ly/Gal2:20)).

Here, Paul uses the same word as it is often used in the Old Testament, meaning the right behavior that God demands from his people.

## Romans 6:19 (id: 25719)

Paul uses the Greek word sarx (human nature, or *flesh*) to refer to the frailty and proneness to sin that characterizes humans. Paul uses the illustration of slavery to show the relationship of the human nature to sin.

## Romans 6:20 (id: 25721)

free from the obligation to do right (literally *free from righteousness*): Paul means either that unbelievers feel no obligation to obey God or that they are unable to do so. But the freedom that they boast of actually makes them slaves to sin.

## Romans 6:21 (id: 25722)

eternal doom (literally *death*): Throughout [chs 5–8](https://ref.ly/Rom5:1-Rom8:39), Paul uses *death* to describe the eternal consequences of sin ([5:12](https://ref.ly/Rom5:12), [14](https://ref.ly/Rom5:14), [15](https://ref.ly/Rom5:15), [17](https://ref.ly/Rom5:17), [21](https://ref.ly/Rom5:21); [6:16](https://ref.ly/Rom6:16), [23](https://ref.ly/Rom6:23); [7:5](https://ref.ly/Rom7:5), [9–10](https://ref.ly/Rom7:9-Rom7:10), [13](https://ref.ly/Rom7:13), [24](https://ref.ly/Rom7:24); [8:2](https://ref.ly/Rom8:2), [6](https://ref.ly/Rom8:6), [13](https://ref.ly/Rom8:13)). The language goes back to God’s warning to Adam and Eve ([Gen 2:17](https://ref.ly/Gen2:17)). This death is not primarily physical death; it denotes separation from the fellowship of God that, if not reversed through faith in Christ, will last forever.

## Romans 7:1 (id: 25732)

Both Jewish Christians and many of the Gentile Christians were familiar with the law. Jews were taught the law of Moses from birth. Many of the Gentiles in the church at Rome had been God\-fearers, Gentiles who were interested in Judaism and attended the synagogue regularly. • the law applies only while a person is living: Paul may be paraphrasing a rabbinic saying: “If a person is dead, he is free from the Torah and the fulfilling of the commandments” (*Babylonian Shabbat* 30a; *baraita* *Shabbat* 151\).

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 7:1

## Romans 7:2–3 (id: 25733)

These verses are not an allegory, in which every element of the story has a theological counterpart. Paul simply cites an illustration to make two basic points: Death can release a person from obligation to the law, and freedom from one relationship can allow a person to establish a new one. Paul applies the illustration in [7:4](https://ref.ly/Rom7:4).

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 7:2–ROM 7:3

## Romans 7:4 (id: 25738)

Christians have died to the power of the law (literally *died to the law*) and so are no longer bound to it. Paul often refers to the law of Moses as representing the old regime of sin and death, but through union with Christ in his death, believers are set free.

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 7:4

## Romans 7:5 (id: 25739)

old nature (literally *flesh*): Although “flesh” can refer to the human body in a neutral sense (see [8:3](https://ref.ly/Rom8:3), which speaks of Christ coming “in the flesh”), Paul more often uses the word negatively, to denote human existence apart from God. To be “in the flesh” is to be dominated by sin and its hostility to God. • the law aroused these evil desires: The law of God is a good thing in itself (see [7:12](https://ref.ly/Rom7:12)), but it arouses sinful tendencies by provoking the rebellion that is in people’s hearts. When we are in rebellion against God, his commands spark in us a desire to do the exact opposite of what he commands.

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 7:5

## Romans 7:6 (id: 25740)

the letter of the law (literally *the letter*): Paul uses the word *letter* to refer to the law, which was engraved on tablets of stone and consisted of individual *letters* (see [2:29](https://ref.ly/Rom2:29); [2 Cor 3:5–7](https://ref.ly/2Cor3:5-2Cor3:7)).

## Romans 7:8 (id: 25742)

sin used this command (literally *sin took an opportunity through this command*): The word *opportunity* is a military term for a position seized in enemy territory that becomes a base of operations (see [7:11](https://ref.ly/Rom7:11)). By expressing God’s demands, the commandments stimulate rebellion in sinful human beings. The commandments of God become an occasion for sin to accomplish its deadly purposes. • sin would not have that power: The law, by clearly expressing God’s will, makes people more accountable than they would be without it. The law of Moses did not solve Israel’s sin problem but exposed and exacerbated it. This is always the effect that God’s law, by itself, has on sinful human beings.

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 7:8

## Romans 7:9 (id: 25743)

At one time I lived without understanding the law: Paul might be referring to his early childhood, before he came to understand the full demands of the law. • But when I learned the command: Paul’s experience with the law as he grew to maturity exemplifies every person’s experience with it. With the law, we have greater accountability to God, which brings the power of sin to life, and the result is greater judgment ([7:10](https://ref.ly/Rom7:10); see [4:15](https://ref.ly/Rom4:15); [5:14](https://ref.ly/Rom5:14), [20](https://ref.ly/Rom5:20)).

However, human beings inherit from Adam a strong tendency to sin. Therefore, when God’s commands come to us, we do not naturally obey them, but resist and disobey them. Instead of bringing life, the law only confirms and exposes our lost and helpless condition. We need a change of heart that the law cannot provide.

## Romans 7:17 (id: 25730)

I am not the one doing wrong: Paul is not evading responsibility for his sin (see also [7:20](https://ref.ly/Rom7:20)). Rather, he is saying that because he genuinely wants to do what the law commands, some other factor must be causing him to do just the opposite. That factor is sin living in me. Paul experiences a divide between his will and his actions.

another power. . . . This power (literally *another law. . . . This law*): Paul plays on the word *law* in these verses. Opposed to God’s law ([7:22](https://ref.ly/Rom7:22)) is another law, a ruling *power* that prevents Paul from submitting to God’s law even though he fully agrees with it.

## Romans 8:1 (id: 25751)

So now there is no condemnation: Paul concludes from the argument of chs [5–7](https://ref.ly/Rom5:1-Rom7:25) that neither sin (ch [6](https://ref.ly/Rom6:1-Rom6:23)) nor the law (ch [7](https://ref.ly/Rom7:1-Rom7:25)) can keep believers from having eternal life (ch [5](https://ref.ly/Rom5:1-Rom5:21)). Paul can triumphantly proclaim that those who belong to Christ Jesus need not fear that they will be condemned for their sins.

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 8:1

## Romans 8:2 (id: 25755)

the power (literally *the law*) of the life\-giving Spirit: This reference to *power* or *law* could refer to the law of Moses, which the Spirit can use to produce life. But because Paul does not portray the law as a life\-giving entity, “law” here, as in [7:23](https://ref.ly/Rom7:23), probably means *principle* or *power.* The Holy Spirit is a power that frees the believer from the power of sin that leads to death.

## Romans 8:3 (id: 25759)

our sinful nature: See study note on 6:19. • in a body like the bodies we sinners have: Jesus identified with sinful people so that he could be their representative and redeem them. Paul also implies that Jesus’ incarnate nature was not exactly like ours; born of a virgin through the power of the Holy Spirit, Jesus did not inherit a sinful nature from Adam. • a sacrifice for our sins: In the Greek Old Testament, this phrase frequently describes a sin offering, and three of the eight New Testament occurrences also have this meaning ([Heb 10:6](https://ref.ly/Heb10:6), [8](https://ref.ly/Heb10:8); [13:11](https://ref.ly/Heb13:11)). Christ was the sin offering that brought forgiveness and turned away God’s wrath. God condemned sin in Christ, our substitute, so that we could escape condemnation.

just requirement of the law . . . fully satisfied for (Greek en*,* “in”) us: The Greek preposition en might indicate that the law is fulfilled *in* us because of our connection with Jesus Christ, who perfectly fulfilled the law for us. It could also mean that by setting us free from sin’s power, Jesus Christ enables us to please God and fulfill the true intention of the law. • As in the Old Testament (see [Gen 6:3](https://ref.ly/Gen6:3), [12](https://ref.ly/Gen6:12); [Ps 78:39](https://ref.ly/Ps78:39); [Isa 40:6](https://ref.ly/Isa40:6)), sinful nature refers to human weakness and bondage to sin (also in [Rom 8:5–9](https://ref.ly/Rom8:5-Rom8:9), [12–13](https://ref.ly/Rom8:12-Rom8:13)). Paul uses the phrase to describe the conflict between the ingrained human tendency to sin and the Holy Spirit.

Paul uses it to remind believers that they enjoy an intimate relationship with God and that they will inherit many of the promises and blessings given to Israel.

you received God’s Spirit when he adopted you as his own children: According to Greco\-Roman customs of adoption, a man had the right to adopt a son and to confer on that child all the legal rights and privileges that would be given to a natural child. This practice extended even to the imperial family. The Roman emperor Julius Caesar adopted Octavian as his heir; Octavian, using the name Augustus, later ruled the Roman Empire. Paul’s concept of adoption is also rooted in the Old Testament and Judaism ([Exod 4:22](https://ref.ly/Exod4:22); [Deut 1:31](https://ref.ly/Deut1:31); [Hos 11:1](https://ref.ly/Hos11:1); see also [Rom 9:4](https://ref.ly/Rom9:4); [Gal 4:5](https://ref.ly/Gal4:5); [Eph 1:5](https://ref.ly/Eph1:5)). • Abba: This word was used in an intimate family context (“Daddy”). Jesus used this word to address God ([Mark 14:36](https://ref.ly/Mark14:36)); all those who become children of God through Jesus have the privilege of addressing God in the same way.

However, just as it was for Jesus, our path to glory is also marked by suffering. We experience the difficulties that come from striving to live righteously in a world dominated by sin ([2 Cor 1:5](https://ref.ly/2Cor1:5); [Phil 1:29](https://ref.ly/Phil1:29); [3:10](https://ref.ly/Phil3:10)).

[1 Cor 15:20](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:20), [23](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:23)). The Holy Spirit is God’s pledge that he will see his work in us through to its conclusion (see [Eph 1:14](https://ref.ly/Eph1:14)). • Although we have already been adopted by God as his children, the full rights of that adoption—our inheritance (see [Rom 8:17](https://ref.ly/Rom8:17))—are not yet ours.

## Romans 9:1–11.36 (id: 25764)

In this section, Paul takes up the problem raised by the unbelief of so many Jews. If God had promised salvation to Israel yet so few Jews were being saved, how could Jesus truly be the fulfillment of God’s plan ([9:1–5](https://ref.ly/Rom9:1-Rom9:5))? In his response to this objection, Paul cites the Old Testament as evidence that God had always intended to save only a remnant of Israel ([9:6–29](https://ref.ly/Rom9:6-Rom9:29)), and he faults the Jews for refusing to embrace Christ ([9:30–10:21](https://ref.ly/Rom9:30-Rom10:21)). Paul then shows that God has not discarded Israel from his plan of salvation. Many Jews have already believed in Christ ([11:1–10](https://ref.ly/Rom11:1-Rom11:10)), and many more will believe in the future ([11:12–26](https://ref.ly/Rom11:12-Rom11:26)).

Paul does not explicitly say why he has such bitter sorrow for his Jewish brothers and sisters.

* **Associated Passages:** ROM 9:2–ROM 9:3

## Romans 9:3 (id: 25780)

I would be willing to be forever cursed (Greek anathema): Anathema is used in the Greek Old Testament to translate a Hebrew expression that means “set apart for God,” which usually has the negative sense of something destined to be destroyed as an offering to God (see [Lev 27:28–29](https://ref.ly/Lev27:28-Lev27:29); [Josh 6:17–18](https://ref.ly/Josh6:17-Josh6:18); [7:1](https://ref.ly/Josh7:1), [11–13](https://ref.ly/Josh7:11-Josh7:13); [22:20](https://ref.ly/Josh22:20); [1 Sam 15:3](https://ref.ly/1Sam15:3); [1 Chr 2:7](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:7)). Paul knows that he cannot, in fact, be cut off from Christ.

Up to this point in Romans, Paul has called the Jewish people *Jews.* His shift to people of Israel*,* here and throughout most of chs [9–11](https://ref.ly/Rom9:1-Rom11:36), is significant. *Jew* connotes national identity, but *Israel* emphasizes the covenant relationship of the people with God. • chosen to be God’s adopted children: The Old Testament called Israel God’s *son* or *child* to emphasize that God had selected Israel to be his own people (e.g., [Exod 4:22](https://ref.ly/Exod4:22); [Jer 3:19](https://ref.ly/Jer3:19); [31:9](https://ref.ly/Jer31:9); [Hos 11:1](https://ref.ly/Hos11:1)). Israel’s adopted status meant that they received God’s blessing and promises, not that they were necessarily saved. • covenants: The Old Testament includes several covenants between God and the people of Israel: one with Abraham ([Gen 17](https://ref.ly/Gen17:1-Gen17:27)), one with the nation through Moses at Mount Sinai ([Exod 19–24](https://ref.ly/Exod19:1-Exod24:18)), and one with David ([2 Sam 7:8–16](https://ref.ly/2Sam7:8-2Sam7:16); [23:5](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:5)).

are truly members of God’s people (literally *are Israel*): “Israel” can refer to the people of Israel in a biological sense, i.e., everyone descended from Jacob. But in the latter part of the Old Testament and in Judaism, the idea of a “righteous remnant” within Israel developed (see [Isa 11:10–16](https://ref.ly/Isa11:10-Isa11:16)). On at least one occasion in the New Testament, Israel refers to everyone, Jew and Gentile, who belongs to God in a spiritual sense ([Gal 6:16](https://ref.ly/Gal6:16)). Paul is stating that there is now an “Israel within Israel,” a community consisting of both Jews and Gentiles who truly believe (cp.

As the older of the twins, Esau was Isaac’s natural heir. But Esau sold his birthright to Jacob and ceded his position to his brother in fulfillment of God’s promise.

“I loved Jacob, but I rejected (literally *hated*) Esau”: Paul quotes [Mal 1:2–3](https://ref.ly/Mal1:2-Mal1:3), where Jacob*,* whose other name is Israel ([Gen 32:28](https://ref.ly/Gen32:28)), stands for the nation of Israel, and Esau stands for Edom. Here, Paul is referring to them as individuals. Just as love can sometimes express a choice, so hate can express rejection. The story of Jacob and Esau illustrates how the sovereign God chooses his own people.

God told Pharaoh: At God’s direction, Moses had asked Pharaoh to let the people of Israel leave Egypt for their own land ([Exod 9:16](https://ref.ly/Exod9:16)). When Pharaoh stubbornly refused, God displayed miracle after miracle to convince Israel, Pharaoh, and the Egyptians of God’s power and authority (see [Exod 6:7](https://ref.ly/Exod6:7); [7:5](https://ref.ly/Exod7:5); [9:14–16](https://ref.ly/Exod9:14-Exod9:16); [14:31](https://ref.ly/Exod14:31)).

God was free to select people from the Jews who would have a true spiritual relationship with him; similarly, he was also free to choose some from the Gentiles to be saved as well. Paul uses the prophecy of Hosea to reinforce his point. Hosea predicted that God would renew his mercy to the ten northern tribes that had rebelled against God and were under his judgment. Paul saw a principle that applies to Gentiles as well. • Those who were not my people: See study note on 10:19.

Zeal denotes a passionate and commendable commitment to God and his purposes (see [Num 25:6–13](https://ref.ly/Num25:6-Num25:13)). But in Paul’s day Jewish zeal was misdirected because it failed to understand that Jesus Christ is the pinnacle of God’s plan.

Here Paul quotes three phrases from [Deut 30:12–14](https://ref.ly/Deut30:12-Deut30:14) dealing with the law, and he applies them to the Good News about Christ. We do not need to go up to heaven to find Christ (and thus to be made right with God), because God has already brought him down to earth as a man. Nor do we need to go down to the place of the dead to find Christ, because God has already raised him from the dead. To find Christ, we must simply believe in the message that is close at hand.

However, as [Rom 10:12](https://ref.ly/Rom10:12) makes clear, *the Lord* in Romans is Jesus Christ. This verse shows that Christians from the time of the apostles have associated Jesus with God.

It is natural to presume that the pronoun they refers to “all who call on him” from [10:12](https://ref.ly/Rom10:12) or “everyone” from [10:13](https://ref.ly/Rom10:13).

Paul argues that Israel was in a position to know what God was doing through Jesus Christ, so they were culpable for their failure to understand or accept it. Israel was guilty both of failing to understand God’s plan in light of Christ ([10:3–4](https://ref.ly/Rom10:3-Rom10:4)) and of focusing so much attention on the law that they missed Christ when he arrived ([9:30–32](https://ref.ly/Rom9:30-Rom9:32)).

In Paul’s day, Israel remained guilty of idolatry because it put the law in place of God himself. God’s punishment involved using the Gentiles, people who are not even a nation*,* to make Israel jealous and angry ([Rom 11:12–32](https://ref.ly/Rom11:12-Rom11:32) elaborates on this theme).

Elijah fled to the wilderness, where he bemoaned his fate. God responded with the assurance that many faithful people remained. Paul found the present situation to be somewhat parallel.

so God made salvation available to the Gentiles: The offer of salvation to the Gentiles is the purpose, not just the result, of Israel’s disobedience. Paul emphasizes that God had the salvation of Gentiles in view all along, and, ultimately, the salvation of many Jews as well. • he wanted his own people to become jealous: The theme of jealousy comes from [Deut 32:21](https://ref.ly/Deut32:21), which Paul quoted in [Rom 10:19](https://ref.ly/Rom10:19). The sight of Gentiles enjoying the blessings of salvation that God had promised to Israel would spur Jews to desire salvation so they could participate in those blessings as well.

He shows that their enjoyment of salvation depends entirely on God’s kindness ([11:22](https://ref.ly/Rom11:22)) and that God’s final goal is to stimulate repentance among the Jews ([11:23](https://ref.ly/Rom11:23)). • I stress this: Paul devoted himself to the conversion of Gentiles because he knew that their salvation would ultimately lead to salvation for Jews as well.

## Romans 11:15 (id: 25562)

The context emphasizes God’s role in hardening many Jews ([11:7–10](https://ref.ly/Rom11:7-Rom11:10)), so the phrase their rejection likely means God’s rejection of the unbelieving Jews. • Their acceptance then refers to God’s acceptance of Jews into his Kingdom (see also [14:3](https://ref.ly/Rom14:3) and [15:7](https://ref.ly/Rom15:7)). • While the phrase life for those who were dead could refer to the new spiritual life that comes to the Jews as a result of their conversion to Christ (see [6:13](https://ref.ly/Rom6:13)), the language more naturally suggests the physical resurrection from the dead that occurs when Christ returns in glory (see, e.g., [1 Thes 4:13–18](https://ref.ly/1Thess4:13-1Thess4:18)).

In Paul’s extended metaphor, God’s special olive tree refers to the people of God.

You are just a branch, not the root: By the time Paul wrote to the church in Rome, it was composed mainly of Gentiles, a common situation in the early Christian communities.

if you stop trusting, you also will be cut off: Scripture consistently emphasizes that only believers who persevere to the end will be saved. However, Paul’s warning leads to debate over the theological implications of his statement. Some think that it implies that genuine believers can stop believing and therefore not be saved in the end. Others argue that we should not press the metaphor so far and that Paul is referring to people who appear to be believers but whose lack of real faith ultimately reveals itself.

Paul usually uses the word mystery to refer to an event of the last days that has already been determined by God.

## Romans 11:26–27 (id: 25570)

The phrase all Israel could refer to the total of all believers, both Jewish and Gentile; with this meaning, and so would describe the way that God works to bring salvation to all his people. Alternatively, *all Israel* could refer to the total of all Jews destined to believe throughout the Christian era, or to a significant number of Jews who turn to Christ in the last days. With the last meaning, *and so* would have a sequential meaning—after the full number of Gentiles comes to Christ, *then* the full number of Jews will be saved. It does not mean all Jewish people (see [2:17–29](https://ref.ly/Rom2:17-Rom2:29)) • In the Old Testament, The one who rescues is the Lord. Paul almost surely is referring to Jesus Christ (see [1 Thes 1:10](https://ref.ly/1Thess1:10)). • from Jerusalem: The Hebrew text of [Isa 59:20](https://ref.ly/Isa59:20) says that the redeemer will come *to* Jerusalem.

This section of Romans sets out the moral and ethical demands of the Good News. God’s gift of salvation in Christ requires a response. God is not satisfied simply with forgiving our sin; he wants to transform our lives. Most of what Paul teaches concerning the moral duties of believers is paralleled in other letters. However, it also seems clear that he has chosen issues pertinent to the situation in Rome—most notably, the dispute between people who are weak in faith and people who are strong in faith ([14:1–15:13](https://ref.ly/Rom14:1-Rom15:13)).

this world (literally *this age*): The division of history into two ages was typical of the Jewish worldview. Early Christians adapted this point of view, identifying the coming of Christ as the time when the new age of salvation began. Unexpectedly, however, the new age did not bring an end to the old age. The old way of thinking and living continues, and it is a source of temptation even to Christians who seek to conform their lives to the values of the new age.

The ability to prophesy was one of the most important of the New Testament gifts (see also [1 Cor 12:28](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:28); [Eph 4:11](https://ref.ly/Eph4:11)). Although prophets are mentioned in several passages in Acts as predicting the future (see [Acts 11:28](https://ref.ly/Acts11:28); [21:10–12](https://ref.ly/Acts21:10-Acts21:12)), the prophet’s most fundamental responsibility is to communicate God’s message to the community of believers ([1 Cor 12:3](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:3), [24–25](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:24-1Cor12:25), [29–30](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:29-1Cor12:30); see also [1 Cor 14:1–40](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:1-1Cor14:40)). • as much faith as God has given you (literally *in proportion to the faith*): *Proportion* (Greek analogia) is a word drawn from mathematics and logic, where it refers to the correct proportions in a relationship among things, quantities, or ideas. Paul uses the phrase to remind prophets to make sure that their utterances are in right proportion to faith, whether the amount of individual faith the prophet has been given, or the Christian faith in general (see study note on Rom 12:3). This passage has given theology the phrase *the analogy of faith,* which refers to the importance of bringing the interpretation of any particular passage into line with the teaching of all of Scripture.

The exhortations in this verse closely resemble two sayings of Jesus ([Matt 5:44](https://ref.ly/Matt5:44); [Luke 6:27–28](https://ref.ly/Luke6:27-Luke6:28)).

## Romans 13:1–2 (id: 25593)

The basic command of [13:1–7](https://ref.ly/Rom13:1-Rom13:7) is to submit to governing authorities. In God’s ordering of the world, we answer to those in positions of authority. Our submission to them will usually take the form of obedience. However, because God stands over all governments, our submission to governing authorities must always be in terms of our ultimate submission to God (see [Acts 4:19–20](https://ref.ly/Acts4:19-Acts4:20)). The Roman Christians might have been resisting government (see study note on Rom 13:6) based on a false understanding of the Good News, as if no longer copying “the behavior and customs of this world” ([12:2](https://ref.ly/Rom12:2)) meant that they could ignore earthly institutions. • placed there by God: Scripture consistently teaches that God is actively involved in raising up and casting down human governments and leaders ([1 Sam 2:6–10](https://ref.ly/1Sam2:6-1Sam2:10); [12:8](https://ref.ly/1Sam12:8); [Prov 8:15–16](https://ref.ly/Prov8:15-Prov8:16); [Isa 41:2–4](https://ref.ly/Isa41:2-Isa41:4); [45:1–7](https://ref.ly/Isa45:1-Isa45:7); [Jer 21:7](https://ref.ly/Jer21:7), [10](https://ref.ly/Jer21:10); [27:5–6](https://ref.ly/Jer27:5-Jer27:6); [Dan 2:21](https://ref.ly/Dan2:21), [37–38](https://ref.ly/Dan2:37-Dan2:38); [4:17](https://ref.ly/Dan4:17)). God instituted governing authorities, so rebelling against them is rebelling against God, who will respond with judgment ([Rom 13:2](https://ref.ly/Rom13:2)).

## Romans 13:3 (id: 25596)

the authorities do not strike fear in people who are doing right: Paul presents a positive picture of the governing authorities, describing them in terms of what God has appointed them to do. He does not touch on situations where leaders punish those who do good and reward those who do evil, although he was certainly aware of such situations from Old Testament and Jewish history, from the experience of Jesus and the other apostles, and from Greco\-Roman affairs. Here, Paul confines himself to discussing the appropriate response to governing authorities who live according to their calling.

## Romans 13:4 (id: 25597)

* Servant: The New Testament often uses this Greek word (*diakonos*) to describe Christians serving God in different roles. In non\-religious Greek, *diakonos* can also refer to a city official. A government and its leaders serve God by administering justice, whether they realize it or not.
* *he does not carry the sword in vain*: Here, *the* *sword* might be a metaphor for any punishment. Some interpreters believe it means human governments, under God's authority, have the right to use capital punishment. (Capital punishment is the practice of killing someone as a legal penalty for certain crimes.)

The two reasons for submission sum up the argument of [13:1–4](https://ref.ly/Rom13:1-Rom13:4) in reverse order: to avoid punishment relates to [13:3–4](https://ref.ly/Rom13:3-Rom13:4), while to keep a clear conscience refers to [13:1–2](https://ref.ly/Rom13:1-Rom13:2). • The word conscience (Greek suneidēsis) refers to the painful knowledge of wrongdoing. Christians know about their duty to submit to governing authorities, and their failure to do so would bring the pain of a guilty conscience.

Pay your taxes: Jesus referred to paying taxes in his famous pronouncement about the disciples’ relationship to government ([Matt 22:21](https://ref.ly/Matt22:21)). A tax revolt occurred in Rome at about the time that Paul was writing, so Paul’s whole discussion of the Christian’s responsibility to government might have been sparked by his knowledge that Roman Christians were participating in this tax revolt (see Tacitus, *Annals* 13\).

The idea of obligation is the hinge that connects [13:1–7](https://ref.ly/Rom13:1-Rom13:7) and [13:8–10](https://ref.ly/Rom13:8-Rom13:10). Christians are to “give to everyone what \[they] owe them” ([13:7](https://ref.ly/Rom13:7)), and Christians always owe love to their neighbors. • Owe nothing to anyone: Debts are not sinful but should be avoided and, if incurred, should be promptly repaid so that the believer is free to serve in love (see [Prov 22:7](https://ref.ly/Prov22:7)). • love one another: Believers are called to love all those they encounter ([Rom 12:14–21](https://ref.ly/Rom12:14-Rom12:21); [Luke 10:25–37](https://ref.ly/Luke10:25-Luke10:37)), but the phrase especially emphasizes the love that each believer owes to other believers. • you will fulfill the requirements of God’s law: This teaching closely follows Jesus’ teaching in [Matt 22:34–40](https://ref.ly/Matt22:34-Matt22:40).

## Romans 13:12–13 (id: 25595)

the day of salvation: The word *day* reflects two sources. First, the Old Testament repeatedly predicts the *day of the* Lord when God’s plan culminates (see [Isa 13:4–13](https://ref.ly/Isa13:4-Isa13:13); [Jer 3:18](https://ref.ly/Jer3:18); [30:8–9](https://ref.ly/Jer30:8-Jer30:9); [Joel 2:1–32](https://ref.ly/Joel2:1-Joel2:32); [Obad 1:15–18](https://ref.ly/Obad1:15-Obad1:18)). Second, the tradition of moral instruction in the ancient world associated light/daytime with good and darkness/nighttime with evil. The Greeks, Romans, and Jews all used this contrast. Because believers belong to the day they should be living out its values, avoiding the dark deeds that are typical of nighttime.

## Romans 14:1–15.7 (id: 25602)

Paul moves to a specific issue that was causing conflict in the church at Rome. The church in Rome was embroiled in a dispute between people who were weak in faith and people who were strong (see [15:1](https://ref.ly/Rom15:1)) regarding certain practices. Throughout this section, Paul instructs believers to be tolerant toward others and their practices; he is convinced that people on both sides of the issue are genuine believers, and he does not think the issues they are fighting over are essential to the faith.

## Romans 14:2 (id: 25613)

The weak in faith apparently believed that they should eat only vegetables. Their conviction probably stemmed from a concern to maintain Jewish ritual purity in the midst of a pagan culture. These Jewish Christians were following the lead of Daniel and his friends, who refused to eat the rich food and wine that the king of Babylon offered them ([Dan 1:3–16](https://ref.ly/Dan1:3-Dan1:16)). Other Jewish sources reveal that pious Jews often restricted their diets in pagan cultures because they could never be sure that meat had been slaughtered according to Jewish requirements.

look down on . . . condemn: The “strong,” those who prided themselves on their enlightened freedom in Christ, looked with disdain on those they considered to be “weak.” The weak, in turn—certain that they were following the true route to piety—condemned the strong for their laxness. These attitudes, over different issues, are mirrored throughout the history of the Christian church. • God has accepted them: Both the weak and the strong are genuine believers, welcomed by God into his family. Therefore, they have no right to treat each other as if they do not belong ([14:4](https://ref.ly/Rom14:4); see also [15:7](https://ref.ly/Rom15:7)).

It is used metaphorically throughout the New Testament for behavior that might bring spiritual harm to another person (see [1 Cor 8:9](https://ref.ly/1Cor8:9), [13](https://ref.ly/1Cor8:13); [1 Jn 2:10](https://ref.ly/1John2:10); cp.

no food, in and of itself, is wrong to eat (literally *nothing is common in itself*): The word *common* signals that the root concern that Paul was addressing was Jewish purity regulations. Jews described food as *common* if it was not clean (i.e., not kosher), thereby causing a Jew to become ritually impure (see [Lev 11](https://ref.ly/Lev11:1-Lev11:47); cp. [Mark 7:2](https://ref.ly/Mark7:2), [5](https://ref.ly/Mark7:5); [Acts 10:14](https://ref.ly/Acts10:14)). Paul again follows the teaching of Jesus that “every kind of food is acceptable in God’s eyes” ([Mark 7:19](https://ref.ly/Mark7:19)). • for that person it is wrong: The truth that no food is wrong to eat was not easy for pious Jews to accept because they had been raised to honor God by avoiding certain foods. Paul urges those who are strong in faith not to force others to violate their consciences (cp. [1 Cor 8:1–13](https://ref.ly/1Cor8:1-1Cor8:13)).

If you do anything you believe is not right, you are sinning: God’s word defines sin for us, yet sin also involves violating our conscience. The weak Christians in Rome did not yet believe in their own hearts that they could eat meat, drink wine, or ignore Jewish holy days; their consciences were still weak. They should not violate their consciences on these matters. Nor should the strong, by the power of their example or by their scorn, force weak Christians to do so.

We who are strong: Paul aligns himself with those he identifies as strong in faith, and he reveals that the division in the Roman church was not simply between Jews and Gentiles. Like Paul, some Jews had enlightened consciences and so were counted among the strong. Similarly, some Gentiles were so strongly influenced by Jewish teaching and tradition that they were among the weak in faith. • must be considerate of those who are sensitive about things like this: This phrase is reminiscent of [Gal 6:2](https://ref.ly/Gal6:2).

In Achaia, Paul had preached in Athens and founded the church in Corinth (see [Acts 16–18](https://ref.ly/Acts16:1-Acts18:28)). • the poor among the believers in Jerusalem: Jewish Christians in Jerusalem were suffering from famines that had hit the area (see [Acts 11:27–30](https://ref.ly/Acts11:27-Acts11:30)) and also because their faith in Christ caused them to be ostracized from Jewish society.

Pray that I will be rescued from those in Judea who refuse to obey God: See [Acts 21–22](https://ref.ly/Acts21:1-Acts22:30). God preserved Paul’s life and used the circumstances of his arrest in Jerusalem to take him precisely where he planned to go—Rome.

Some manuscripts do not include Amen. One very early manuscript places the doxology ([16:25–27](https://ref.ly/Rom16:25-Rom16:27)) here. This has led some scholars to conclude that the original letter to the Romans consisted of only [1:1–15:33](https://ref.ly/Rom1:1-Rom15:33), but few now follow this theory. The best early manuscripts place the doxology at the end of ch [16](https://ref.ly/Rom16:1-Rom16:27), and the whole of ch [16](https://ref.ly/Rom16:1-Rom16:27) was most likely part of Paul’s original letter to the Romans. See also study note on 16:1–16.

## Romans 16:1 (id: 25642)

A deacon (Greek diakonos*,* “servant”) refers both to a Christian who is recognized as a servant of Christ and specifically to someone who holds the office of deacon in a particular church (see [Phil 1:1](https://ref.ly/Phil1:1); [1 Tim 3:8–12](https://ref.ly/1Tim3:8-1Tim3:12); cp. [Acts 6:1–6](https://ref.ly/Acts6:1-Acts6:6)). • Cenchrea was located about five miles from Corinth and functioned as its port. Paul might have been writing this letter to the Romans from Corinth on a winter\-long stop there near the end of his third missionary journey (see [Acts 20:2–3](https://ref.ly/Acts20:2-Acts20:3)).

Paul here commended and greeted twenty\-seven Roman Christians, ten of whom were women. Women played important roles in the early church. • Paul had never been to Rome, which has led to some speculation as to how he knew so many people there. One theory is that ch [16](https://ref.ly/Rom16:1-Rom16:27) was actually part of another letter that Paul sent to Ephesus. However, we have no good manuscript evidence for a separate letter (cp. study note on 15:33). Perhaps the answer is that Paul was able to greet so many people in Rome because he had encountered them during their travels away from Rome (see Romans Book Introduction, “Setting”).

she has been helpful to many: This phrase indicates the ancient role of the patron, a wealthy person who used influence and money to help people and causes. Phoebe was apparently a woman of wealth and influence who used her resources to help missionaries such as Paul.

Priscilla and Aquila were Paul’s good friends. After leaving Rome around AD 49, they became his co\-workers for an extended time in Corinth and Ephesus (see [Acts 18–19](https://ref.ly/Acts18:1-Acts19:41)). They had apparently returned to Rome by the time Paul wrote Romans (about AD 57\).

## Romans 16:3–16 (id: 25651)

Although Paul had never visited the Christian community in Rome, he established rapport with these believers by personally greeting many of the church’s members. The names reveal that the Roman Christian community was very diverse—Jews and Gentiles, slaves and free, men and women all formed a new society in the church (see [Gal 3:26–29](https://ref.ly/Gal3:26-Gal3:29)).

the church that meets in their home: Early Christians did not have large buildings for their meetings—they met in private homes. The church in Rome was composed of a number of house churches where small groups of believers gathered for worship and instruction.

## Romans 16:7 (id: 25654)

In Greek, the name Junia could refer to a man named *Junias* or to a woman named *Junia.* Most interpreters understand *Junia* as a feminine name. This section pairs masculine and feminine names to refer to husband\-and\-wife teams, so Junia was probably a woman. • who were in prison with me: When this occurred is uncertain. According to Acts, Paul had been imprisoned overnight in Philippi ([Acts 16:19–28](https://ref.ly/Acts16:19-Acts16:28)); after Romans was written, he would later be imprisoned for two years in Caesarea ([Acts 24:27](https://ref.ly/Acts24:27)) and for two years in Rome ([Acts 28:30–31](https://ref.ly/Acts28:30-Acts28:31)). Paul was undoubtedly imprisoned on occasions not mentioned in Acts (see [2 Cor 11:23](https://ref.ly/2Cor11:23)). • highly respected among the apostles: This phrase probably indicates that Andronicus and Junia were apostles—i.e., accredited missionaries of the church (see [Acts 14:4](https://ref.ly/Acts14:4), [14](https://ref.ly/Acts14:14); [1 Cor 9:5–6](https://ref.ly/1Cor9:5-1Cor9:6); [Gal 2:9](https://ref.ly/Gal2:9)).

This Aristobulus was probably the same man as the brother of Herod Agrippa I; Aristobulus was a member of the Roman aristocracy who lived in Rome many years prior to his death in AD 48 or 49 (see Josephus, *Antiquities* 18\.8\.4; *War* 2\.11\.6\). His household probably refers to his family and their servants in Rome.

with a sacred kiss: The kiss was a common way to greet another person in the ancient world and particularly among the Jews. It is mentioned frequently in the New Testament as a greeting ([1 Cor 16:20](https://ref.ly/1Cor16:20); [2 Cor 13:12](https://ref.ly/2Cor13:12); [1 Thes 5:26](https://ref.ly/1Thess5:26); see [1 Pet 5:14](https://ref.ly/1Pet5:14)); the kiss of peace became a standard feature of the Christian liturgy by the second century.

The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet: Paul alludes to the curse that God pronounced upon the serpent after he had deceived Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden ([Gen 3:15](https://ref.ly/Gen3:15)). Christ, the offspring of Eve, will soon crush Satan under the feet of the church (cp. [Matt 16:18–19](https://ref.ly/Matt16:18-Matt16:19)).

Timothy was one of Paul’s closest ministry associates. Timothy accompanied Paul on his second missionary journey ([Acts 16:2–3](https://ref.ly/Acts16:2-Acts16:3)) and was with Paul in Corinth while Paul wrote this letter to the Roman church (see [Acts 20:2–4](https://ref.ly/Acts20:2-Acts20:4)).

plan (literally *mystery*): For Paul, the *mystery* is the truth about God and his plan that was not clearly known in the Old Testament era but which has been revealed in the New Testament era. While the Old Testament predicted the conversion of Gentiles, it did not make clear that Gentiles would become equal members of the people of God without becoming proselytes of Judaism.

This doxology makes a very appropriate conclusion to Paul’s letter and its argument, reprising many of the themes found at the very beginning ([1:1–15](https://ref.ly/Rom1:1-Rom1:15)). • The doxology is missing in two late manuscripts and is in different places in other manuscripts (after [14:23](https://ref.ly/Rom14:23) and after [15:33](https://ref.ly/Rom15:33)). Therefore, these verses might have been added to Paul’s letter at a later time. However, the majority of manuscripts do include the doxology at the end of the letter, and it uses vocabulary and themes common in the rest of the letter. Paul most likely wrote it himself as a conclusion to the letter.
