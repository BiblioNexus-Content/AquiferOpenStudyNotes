## Colossians 1:1 (id: 9808)

Timothy was one of the closest co\-workers of Paul. Their relationship was very strong. The work of Timothy was so important that Paul included him as a sender of this letter. He also included him in 2 Corinthians, Philippians, 1 and 2 Thessalonians, and Philemon.

* **Associated Passages:** COL 1:1

## Colossians 1:2 (id: 9817)

* Colossae was in the Lycus River valley in western Asia Minor. It was about 193 kilometers (120 miles) east of Ephesus and 16 kilometers (10 miles) southeast of Laodicea. Its place on an important Roman road exposed it to the social and religious trends of the time.
* *brothers*: Greek *adelphoi*, a term used for family members, both male and female.

* **Associated Passages:** COL 1:2

## Colossians 1:3–14 (id: 9818)

This section starts with a thanksgiving, common in New Testament letters. Paul thanks God for the growth of the faith of the Colossians. He prays they will understand it even more. Through this prayer, Paul shows his concern about the influence of false teachers.

* **Associated Passages:** COL 1:3–COL 1:14

## Colossians 1:4 (id: 9819)

*All the saints* (meaning *holy ones*): The New Testament calls all Christians *saints*. They are set apart by God as his holy people ([3:12](https://ref.ly/Col3:12)).

* **Associated Passages:** COL 1:4

## Colossians 1:5 (id: 9820)

* The confident hope of the Colossian Christians provides a strong base for their faith and love ([1:4](https://ref.ly/Col1:4)).
* What God has reserved for believers has not yet been fully revealed, but it already exists in heaven.

* **Associated Passages:** COL 1:5

## Colossians 1:6 (id: 9821)

*All over the world this gospel is bearing fruit and growing*: The good news about Jesus is effective in changing lives and producing spiritual growth (compare [1:10](https://ref.ly/Col1:10)).

* **Associated Passages:** COL 1:6

## Colossians 1:7 (id: 9822)

Epaphras probably became a Christian when Paul preached in Ephesus (see [Acts 19:10](https://ref.ly/Acts19:10); see also [Colossians 4:12–13](https://ref.ly/Col4:12-Col4:13); [Philemon 1:23](https://ref.ly/Phlm1:23)). He then went back to Colossae to share the good news about Jesus with his own town.

* **Associated Passages:** COL 1:7

## Colossians 1:9–10 (id: 9823)

Paul prays that God would help his readers understand the the good news about Jesus better and its full expression in their lives. Spiritual growth leads to a clearer understanding of Christian truth and actions that please the Lord. This understanding gives believers the strength and patience to resist evil ([1:11](https://ref.ly/Col1:11)).

* **Associated Passages:** COL 1:9–COL 1:10

## Colossians 1:12–13 (id: 9802)

* *giving thanks to the Father*: having humble gratitude to God for salvation gives powerful help to resist false teachings (see also [2:7](https://ref.ly/Col2:7); [3:17](https://ref.ly/Col3:17); [4:2](https://ref.ly/Col4:2)).
* The inheritance is what God has promised his people (for example, see [Deuteronomy 3:28](https://ref.ly/Deut3:28); [Psalm 33:12](https://ref.ly/Ps33:12); [Ezekiel 44:28](https://ref.ly/Ezek44:28)). In the New Testament, *the inheritance* includes salvation and final rescue (see also [Ephesians 1:11](https://ref.ly/Eph1:11); [Titus 3:7](https://ref.ly/Titus3:7); [Hebrews 9:15](https://ref.ly/Heb9:15)).

* **Associated Passages:** COL 1:12–COL 1:13

## Colossians 1:15 (id: 9804)

* *the image*: In the Greek translation of the Old Testament, *eikōn* means "image" or "representation." It describes humans as made in the image of God ([Genesis 1:26–27](https://ref.ly/Gen1:26-Gen1:27)). It also refers to the wisdom figure in Jewish writings (see Wisdom of Solomon 7:25–26\). New Testament writers describe Christ as "the wisdom of God" to explain his importance (compare [1 Corinthians 1:24](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:24), [30](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:30)).
* *the firstborn over all creation*: This phrase was important in early Christian debates about Christ's nature. *Firstborn* does not mean God created him. It is a title from the Old Testament, showing supremacy in rank and priority in time (see, for example, [Psalm 89:27](https://ref.ly/Ps89:27)).

* **Associated Passages:** COL 1:15

## Colossians 1:15–20 (id: 9803)

Paul describes Jesus as the ultimate creator and redeemer ([1:15–17](https://ref.ly/Col1:15-Col1:17); [1:18–20](https://ref.ly/Col1:18-Col1:20)). Three main things suggest these verses quote an early Christian hymn about Jesus:

1. These verses are brief statements.
2. These verses have contain high praise and special honor for Christ (he is exalted).
3. These verses use similar language and ideas.

Paul applied this hymn to the situation of the church in Colossae.

* **Associated Passages:** COL 1:15–COL 1:20

## Colossians 1:16 (id: 9805)

* *Thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities* in the unseen world refer to different spiritual powers. This line emphasizes Christ's supremacy over these beings, who were getting a lot of attention from false teachers (see [2:18](https://ref.ly/Col2:18)).
* *All things were created through Him and for Him*: Christ is both the creator of all things and the purpose of all creation.

* **Associated Passages:** COL 1:16

## Colossians 1:18 (id: 9806)

* *Head of the body, the church*: The Greek word *kephalē* (meaning “head”) often has the sense of *authority over* or *chief* when Paul uses it as a metaphor (see also [2:10](https://ref.ly/Col2:10), [19](https://ref.ly/Col2:19); [1 Corinthians 11:3–10](https://ref.ly/1Cor11:3-1Cor11:10); [Ephesians 4:15](https://ref.ly/Eph4:15); [5:23](https://ref.ly/Eph5:23)).
* *of the body*: The metaphor of the church as Christ’s body shows the essential unity of Christ and the church (see also [Colossians 1:24](https://ref.ly/Col1:24); [2:19](https://ref.ly/Col2:19); [3:15](https://ref.ly/Col3:15); [Ephesians 1:23](https://ref.ly/Eph1:23); [2:16](https://ref.ly/Eph2:16); [4:4](https://ref.ly/Eph4:4), [12](https://ref.ly/Eph4:12); [5:23](https://ref.ly/Eph5:23), [30](https://ref.ly/Eph5:30)).
* *firstborn from among the dead*: See study note on Colossians 1:15.

## Colossians 1:19 (id: 9807)

God, in all his fullness, shows that he has chosen to give a complete revelation of himself in Jesus Christ. By seeing and understanding Jesus, we also see and understand God (see [John 14:6–11](https://ref.ly/John14:6-John14:11)). Some false teachers claimed that Christians needed to seek other spiritual beings to learn more about God (see [Colossians 1:16](https://ref.ly/Col1:16), [20](https://ref.ly/Col1:20)). Yet, Christ alone is enough for all our knowledge of God (compare [Colossians 2:8–9](https://ref.ly/Col2:8-Col2:9)).

* **Associated Passages:** COL 1:19

## Colossians 1:20 (id: 9809)

Through Jesus Christ, God has made peace with everything. He has restored his control over all creation, in the spiritual places and on earth.

* **Associated Passages:** COL 1:20

## Colossians 1:21 (id: 9811)

The phrase *alienated from God* probably describes their condition as non\-Jews or gentiles (see [Ephesians 2:12](https://ref.ly/Eph2:12)).

* **Associated Passages:** COL 1:21

## Colossians 1:21–23 (id: 9810)

Paul shares the message of [1:15–20](https://ref.ly/Col1:15-Col1:20) with the Christians in Colossae. Since God has reconciled them, they now have a new spiritual status. They need to stay strong in the truth they have learned.

* **Associated Passages:** COL 1:21–COL 1:23

## Colossians 1:22 (id: 9812)

The Colossians, like all believers, were considered holy and blameless by God. This was not due to their own perfection but because Christ's death reconciled them with God.

* **Associated Passages:** COL 1:22

## Colossians 1:23 (id: 9813)

*proclaimed to every creature under heaven*:Paul used hyperbole (exaggeration for emphasis) when he said the gospel *has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven*. He meant that key cities in the Roman world had established centers for spreading the good news about Jesus (see also [1:6](https://ref.ly/Col1:6)).

* **Associated Passages:** COL 1:23

## Colossians 1:24 (id: 9815)

*I fill up in my flesh what is lacking in regard to Christ’s afflictions*: Christ's suffering for redemption is unique and fully accomplished. Yet, he continues to suffer through his followers in a world opposed to the message of redemption. Christ and his church will keep suffering until God completes his purposes for this world (see also [Mark 13:19–23](https://ref.ly/Mark13:19-Mark13:23); [Romans 8:17–18](https://ref.ly/Rom8:17-Rom8:18); [1 Thessalonians 3:3](https://ref.ly/1Thess3:3)).

* **Associated Passages:** COL 1:24

## Colossians 1:24–2.5 (id: 9814)

Paul considers his own role in the widespread preaching of the good news about Jesus ([1:23](https://ref.ly/Col1:23)).

* **Associated Passages:** COL 1:24–COL 2:5

## Colossians 1:26 (id: 9816)

The idea of a hidden *mystery*… *now revealed* comes from Jewish apocalyptic beliefs. Jewish thinkers believed God's entire plan already existed in heaven. It remained hidden until God chose to reveal it. The good news, especially for non\-Jews, remained secret until Christ revealed it.

* **Associated Passages:** COL 1:26

## Colossians 2:1–5 (id: 9824)

* Paul wants to build a stronger relationship with the Colossians, even though he has not met them. He also aims to correct false teachings that threaten their Christian community.
* *Laodicea* was 10 miles northwest of Colossae.

* **Associated Passages:** COL 2:1–COL 2:5

## Colossians 2:2 (id: 9835)

*the mystery of God*: Christ himself is this plan (see [1:26](https://ref.ly/Col1:26)).

* **Associated Passages:** COL 2:2

## Colossians 2:3 (id: 9836)

Paul expands on [1:15–20](https://ref.ly/Col1:15-Col1:20): Christ is all we need for spiritual understanding.

* **Associated Passages:** COL 2:3

## Colossians 2:6–15 (id: 9837)

Paul urges the Colossians to stay strong in their faith in Christ, despite the tempting arguments of the false teachers. *For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity dwells in bodily form*. Christ alone makes them complete.

* **Associated Passages:** COL 2:6–COL 2:15

## Colossians 2:8 (id: 9838)

* *philosophy*:The Greek word *philosophia* included everything from Plato's ideas about existence to religious teachings of false religions. Paul does not criticize philosophy itself, but only empty philosophical ideas that oppose the good news.
* *the spiritual forces of the world* (also in [2:20](https://ref.ly/Col2:20)): This phrase might refer to basic teachings common in this world (see [Hebrews 5:12](https://ref.ly/Heb5:12)), or to spiritual beings believed to have powerful influence over historical events (see also [Colossians 2:15](https://ref.ly/Col2:15), [20](https://ref.ly/Col2:20); [Galatians 4:3](https://ref.ly/Gal4:3)).

* **Associated Passages:** COL 2:8

## Colossians 2:11 (id: 9825)

* *the circumcision performed by Christ*: Spiritual conversion to Christ is equivalent to physical circumcision to the body.
* *the putting off of your sinful nature*(literally *the cutting away of the body of the flesh*): Just as Jewish boys have their foreskin removed to join the people of God, believers have their metaphorical *flesh* (translated *sinful nature*) removed when they become Christians.

* **Associated Passages:** COL 2:11

## Colossians 2:12 (id: 9826)

*Having been buried with Him in baptism*: In a similar passage ([Romans 6:3–6](https://ref.ly/Rom6:3-Rom6:6)), Paul emphasizes the strong identity between believers and Christ. In God's view, we were truly *with Him* during his burial and resurrection. So we gain the benefits of his actions for us. Paul can connect this identification with Christ to baptism. This is because, in the early church, water baptism was closely related to conversion.

* **Associated Passages:** COL 2:12

## Colossians 2:14 (id: 9827)

*the decrees that stood against us*: The Greek phrase suggests a signed acknowledgment of debt. We cannot pay what we owe, so it stands *against us.* The law of God requires obedience that people cannot give. But God has forgiven our debt through the work of Christ ([2:13](https://ref.ly/Col2:13)).

* **Associated Passages:** COL 2:14

## Colossians 2:15 (id: 9828)

*He made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them* (literally *he led \[them] in a victory parade*): The Roman army celebrated a big victory with a parade. The winning Roman general would lead the embarrassed captives into the conquered city. This image clearly pictures the great victory of God. Through the cross of Christ, God has defeated all hostile spiritual forces (see also [Ephesians 4:7–11](https://ref.ly/Eph4:7-Eph4:11)).

* **Associated Passages:** COL 2:15

## Colossians 2:16 (id: 9830)

* *what you eat or drink*: Many ancient religions had rules about what foods and drinks they allowed. The Old Testament does not prohibit alcohol, but some devout Jews chose not to drink it, especially those who lived in non\-Jewish cultures (see [Daniel 1:8–16](https://ref.ly/Dan1:8-Dan1:16)).
* Many ancient religious groups, including Jews, held ceremonies to celebrate the new moon (see [Numbers 10:10](https://ref.ly/Num10:10); [Psalm 81:3](https://ref.ly/Ps81:3); [Isaiah 1:13](https://ref.ly/Isa1:13)).
* The Jewish Sabbath was part of the law of Moses and essential in Jewish religion. Christians could choose to observe the Sabbath, but Paul says they have the freedom to decide (see [Romans 14:5](https://ref.ly/Rom14:5)). He said that forcing Sabbath observance is wrong. Observing the Sabbath was not necessary to express Christian devotion.

* **Associated Passages:** COL 2:16

## Colossians 2:16–23 (id: 9829)

Paul rejects the false teachers and their demands, explaining that their ideas come from human teachings (see [2:8](https://ref.ly/Col2:8)). They advocated various rules of conduct that had no basis in Christ.

* **Associated Passages:** COL 2:16–COL 2:23

## Colossians 2:17 (id: 9831)

The Old Testament ceremonies anticipated the coming of Christ, which Paul refers to as shadows (see also [Hebrews 10:1](https://ref.ly/Heb10:1)).

* **Associated Passages:** COL 2:17

## Colossians 2:18 (id: 9832)

* *the worship of angels*: People in the first century were very interested in spiritual beings. Some Jews believed that angels were present with them during their times of worship, and some people might even have prayed to angels or worshiped them directly.
* The false teachers claimed to have had visions that made certain ceremonies necessary for the community.

* **Associated Passages:** COL 2:18

## Colossians 2:20 (id: 9833)

*you have died with Christ*: When Christ died on the cross, he defeated the spiritual powers ([2:15](https://ref.ly/Col2:15)). By sharing in his death, he frees us from the evil spiritual powers of the world (see [2:8](https://ref.ly/Col2:8)).

* **Associated Passages:** COL 2:20

## Colossians 2:23 (id: 9834)

*they are of no value*: These rules come from the world, not from Christ ([2:19](https://ref.ly/Col2:19)). They cannot conquer a person's evil desires.

* **Associated Passages:** COL 2:23

## Colossians 3:1 (id: 9848)

*strive for the things above*: Christians live on earth, but their true selves *have been raised with Christ.* Thisconnects them to the spiritual world where Christ rules. In contrast, the commands and teachings of false teachers focus on earthly matters ([2:22](https://ref.ly/Col2:22)).

* **Associated Passages:** COL 3:1

## Colossians 3:1–11 (id: 9839)

Paul calls on the Colossians to adopt a new mindset that leads to a different way of living.

* **Associated Passages:** COL 3:1–COL 3:11

## Colossians 3:3–4 (id: 9850)

* *you died*: See [2:20](https://ref.ly/Col2:20).
* What isnow hidden will be revealed one day (compare [1:26](https://ref.ly/Col1:26)). We cannot see Christ sitting at the right hand of God or that we have new life with Christ. But by faith in the good news, we know these things are true. When Christ returns in glory, everyone will see his supremacy. Then our relationship to him will become direct experience.

* **Associated Passages:** COL 3:3–COL 3:4

## Colossians 3:5 (id: 9851)

* *Put to death, therefore*:We must truly die to this life by how we live each day ([3:3](https://ref.ly/Col3:3)) .
* *greed, which is idolatry*: Greedy people pursue money, sex, power, and possessions instead of God. They hope to find happiness in those things and treat them like idols.

* **Associated Passages:** COL 3:5

## Colossians 3:6 (id: 9852)

*coming*: Some manuscripts say *coming on all who disobey him.* In the Greek text, these words are exactly the same as in [Ephesians 5:6](https://ref.ly/Eph5:6). An early scribe might have added them here on purpose or by mistake.

* **Associated Passages:** COL 3:6

## Colossians 3:8 (id: 9853)

*put aside* (literally *take off*): Taking off clothes is a metaphor for removing habits that interfere with our relationship with the Lord (see [Romans 13:12](https://ref.ly/Rom13:12); [Ephesians 4:22](https://ref.ly/Eph4:22), [25](https://ref.ly/Eph4:25); [Hebrews 12:1](https://ref.ly/Heb12:1); [James 1:21](https://ref.ly/Jas1:21); [1 Peter 2:1](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:1)).

* **Associated Passages:** COL 3:8

## Colossians 3:9–10 (id: 9854)

*the old self … the new self*: Paul contrasts old and new identities (see also [Romans 5:12–21](https://ref.ly/Rom5:12-Rom5:21); [6:6](https://ref.ly/Rom6:6); [Ephesians 4:22–24](https://ref.ly/Eph4:22-Eph4:24)). Believers stop living the way they used to and start living a new life in Christ, letting him be Lord and guide the way they live.

* **Associated Passages:** COL 3:9–COL 3:10

## Colossians 3:11 (id: 9840)

*barbarian, Scythian*: The Greeks mocked people from other cultures for their inability to speak Greek well. They claimed those people could only say “bar bar” (which is where the word *barbarian* comes from). The Scythians were tribes on the north coast of the Black Sea, known for being fierce and crude (see Josephus, *Against Apion* 2\.38\). In the Christian faith, these kinds of differences between people groups do not matter. The Bible teaches that our relationship with God through Christ is more important than cultural differences or where we come from.

* **Associated Passages:** COL 3:11

## Colossians 3:12–17 (id: 9841)

Paul explains the new life of those who have been raised with Christ ([3:1](https://ref.ly/Col3:1)). Their good qualities and actions contribute to the peace and strength of the Christian community.

* **Associated Passages:** COL 3:12–COL 3:17

## Colossians 3:15 (id: 9842)

Just as Christ is one, there can only be one body of Christ (see [1:18](https://ref.ly/Col1:18); [Ephesians 4:4–6](https://ref.ly/Eph4:4-Eph4:6)). Loyalty to Jesus as Lord should go beyond differences and lead to peace in our relationships.

* **Associated Passages:** COL 3:15

## Colossians 3:16 (id: 9843)

*Psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs* are for praise and worship (see [1 Corinthians 14:26](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:26); [Ephesians 5:19](https://ref.ly/Eph5:19)). The book of Psalms serves as the original example.

* **Associated Passages:** COL 3:16

## Colossians 3:17 (id: 9844)

*in the name of the Lord Jesus*: In the Bible, a person's name represents that person. To do something *in the name* *of the Lord Jesus* means to act in a way that aligns with his identity and authority.

* **Associated Passages:** COL 3:17

## Colossians 3:18 (id: 9846)

To *submit* means understanding your position below someone else in a society. This submission always suggests that God is at the top and his will is most important (see [Acts 4:19–20](https://ref.ly/Acts4:19-Acts4:20); [5:29](https://ref.ly/Acts5:29)).

* **Associated Passages:** COL 3:18

## Colossians 3:18–4.1 (id: 9845)

This series of teachings is called a *household code.* Paul instructs wives ([3:18](https://ref.ly/Col3:18)), husbands ([3:19](https://ref.ly/Col3:19)), children ([3:20](https://ref.ly/Col3:20)), fathers ([3:21](https://ref.ly/Col3:21)), slaves ([3:22–25](https://ref.ly/Col3:22-Col3:25)), and masters ([4:1](https://ref.ly/Col4:1)). Similar codes are found in Greco\-Roman writings and other parts of the New Testament (see [Ephesians 5:22–6:9](https://ref.ly/Eph5:22-Eph6:9); [1 Peter 2:18–3:7](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:18-1Pet3:7)).

* **Associated Passages:** COL 3:18–COL 4:1

## Colossians 3:19 (id: 9847)

After instructing wives to submit to their husbands, the Paul encourages husbands to love their wives (see also [Ephesians 5:25–30](https://ref.ly/Eph5:25-Eph5:30); [1 Peter 3:7](https://ref.ly/1Pet3:7)).

* **Associated Passages:** COL 3:19

## Colossians 3:22–24 (id: 9849)

* Slaves have masters on earth they must obey. Slavery was central to life and the economy in the ancient world. The New Testament does not directly oppose slavery. Yet, Christian faith creates relationships that change the nature of the social structure (see [Philemon 1:15–16](https://ref.ly/Phlm1:15-Phlm1:16)).
* *It is the Lord Christ you are serving*: All Christians, whether slave or free, serve a higher Master. His will is most important.

* **Associated Passages:** COL 3:22–COL 3:24

## Colossians 4:1 (id: 9864)

*Masters*: Christian slave owners needed to understand that they were also slaves who had to obey Jesus Christ, their Master in heaven. He treats everyone with dignity and kindness.

* **Associated Passages:** COL 4:1

## Colossians 4:2 (id: 9866)

*being watchful*: The Greek verb for this phrase in the New Testament emphasizes the need for Christians to stay watchful because Christ will return ([Matthew 24:42](https://ref.ly/Matt24:42); [25:13](https://ref.ly/Matt25:13); [Mark 13:35](https://ref.ly/Mark13:35), [37](https://ref.ly/Mark13:37); [1 Thessalonians 5:6](https://ref.ly/1Thess5:6); [Revelation 3:3](https://ref.ly/Rev3:3); [16:15](https://ref.ly/Rev16:15)).

* **Associated Passages:** COL 4:2

## Colossians 4:2–6 (id: 9865)

New Testament letters often end by encouraging readers to pray and requests for their prayers.

* **Associated Passages:** COL 4:2–COL 4:6

## Colossians 4:3 (id: 9867)

* *God may open to us a door for the word*: An open door symbolizes an opportunity to share the good news (see also [Acts 14:27](https://ref.ly/Acts14:27); [1 Corinthians 16:9](https://ref.ly/1Cor16:9); [2 Corinthians 2:12](https://ref.ly/2Cor2:12)).
* *the mystery of Christ*: See [Colossians 1:26–27](https://ref.ly/Col1:26-Col1:27); [2:2](https://ref.ly/Col2:2).
* *for which I am in chains*: Paul's commitment to spreading the good news led to his imprisonment (see Colossians Book Introduction, “Date and Occasion of Writing”).

* **Associated Passages:** COL 4:3
* **Associated Articles:** Colossians (ID: `27336@TyndaleStudyNotesBookIntros`)

## Colossians 4:5 (id: 9868)

*redeeming the time* (literally *buy up the time*): Just like people buy up a product at a good price, Christians should take advantage of every opportunity God gives them to share the good news and serve others.

* **Associated Passages:** COL 4:5

## Colossians 4:6 (id: 9869)

*seasoned with salt*: Salt is both a seasoning and a preservative (see [Matthew 5:13](https://ref.ly/Matt5:13)). Paul might be encouraging Christians to speak to non\-believers with well\-chosen and appealing words. The Jewish rabbis sometimes referred to wisdom as *salt,* so Paul might also be urging Christians to speak wisely.

* **Associated Passages:** COL 4:6

## Colossians 4:7 (id: 9871)

Tychicus came from the province of Asia, where Colossae was ([Acts 20:4](https://ref.ly/Acts20:4)). He worked with Paul especially in that area ([Ephesians 6:21](https://ref.ly/Eph6:21); [2 Timothy 4:12](https://ref.ly/2Tim4:12)). Later, Paul sent him to assist Titus in Crete ([Titus 3:12](https://ref.ly/Titus3:12)). Tychicus probably delivered this letter along with the letters known as Ephesians and Philemon.

* **Associated Passages:** COL 4:7

## Colossians 4:7–18 (id: 9870)

Most New Testament letters end with greetings and mentions of co\-workers and travel plans. But this section of Colossians is longer than usual. Since Paul could not travel, he might have wanted the Colossians to stay connected with his co\-workers. This would help them avoid being misled by false teachers.

## Colossians 4:9 (id: 9872)

Onesimus was a runaway slave whom Paul sent back to his master, Philemon (see the [book of Philemon](https://ref.ly/Phlm1:1-Phlm1:25)).

## Colossians 4:10 (id: 9856)

* *Aristarchus* was a common name, but he was probably the same man from Thessalonica who traveled with Paul to Rome ([Acts 19:29](https://ref.ly/Acts19:29); [20:4](https://ref.ly/Acts20:4); [27:2](https://ref.ly/Acts27:2)). Acts does not mention *Aristarchus* was also arrested, so he might have chosen to stay in prison with Paul to support and help him.
* *Mark the cousin of Barnabas* joined Barnabas and Paul on their first missionary trip but left before it ended ([Acts 13:13](https://ref.ly/Acts13:13)). This caused a disagreement between Paul and Barnabas before their second trip ([Acts 15:37–40](https://ref.ly/Acts15:37-Acts15:40)). Paul and Mark seem to have reconciled at some point (see also [2 Timothy 4:11](https://ref.ly/2Tim4:11); [Philemon 1:24](https://ref.ly/Phlm1:24)).
* *You have already received instructions*: There is no other record of this message.

## Colossians 4:10–14 (id: 9855)

Out of the six people named, five are also mentioned in [Philemon 1:23–24](https://ref.ly/Phlm1:23-Phlm1:24).

## Colossians 4:11 (id: 9857)

*Jesus, who is called Justus*, appears only in this part of the New Testament. Paul uses the family name *Justus* because *Jesus* (meaning *the Lord saves*) was a common name among Jews in the first century.

## Colossians 4:13 (id: 9858)

*Laodicea and Hierapolis* were the two most important cities in the Lycus River valley. Epaphras prayed for believers in Colossae and these nearby cities. This suggests that Epaphras was probably the first person to share the good news about Jesus in all three of these cities.

## Colossians 4:14 (id: 9859)

* *Luke, the beloved physician*, is famous for writing Acts and the Gospel of Luke. This verse is the only proof of two things about Luke: he was a doctor, and he was not a Jewish believer (see [Colossians 4:10–11](https://ref.ly/Col4:10-Col4:11)).
* Unlike the others mentioned in this passage, there are no details about *Demas*. Maybe Paul did not know him well. *Demas* later left Paul ([2 Timothy 4:10](https://ref.ly/2Tim4:10)).

## Colossians 4:15 (id: 9860)

*Nympha* hosted a church in her home. In the first two centuries of the Christian church, most believers gathered for worship in private homes. We know nothing else about Nympha.

## Colossians 4:16 (id: 9861)

*make sure that it is also read*: Over the years, people have tried to match the letter to the Laodiceans with a New Testament letter or fragment. Yet, Paul's letter to the church in Laodicea has probably been lost.

* **Associated Passages:** COL 4:16

## Colossians 4:17 (id: 9862)

*Archippus* (see also [Philemon 1:2](https://ref.ly/Phlm1:2)): We do not have any way of knowing more information about the work the Lord assigned to him.

* **Associated Passages:** COL 4:17

## Colossians 4:18 (id: 9863)

*This greeting is in my own hand—Paul*: The letter to the Colossians, like most ancient letters, was probably not written entirely by Paul himself. Instead, Paul likely spoke the words while a scribe wrote them down. This scribe is also called an amanuensis (a person trained to write neatly and clearly). To show that the letter was truly from him, Paul added his own greeting at the end in his own handwriting. This was his way of proving the letter was authentic and not a fake (compare Paul's comment in [2 Thessalonians 2:2](https://ref.ly/2Thess2:2)).
