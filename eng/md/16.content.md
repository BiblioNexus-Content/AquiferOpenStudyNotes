## Nehemiah 1:1 (id: 22426)

* Artaxerxes I ruled Persia from 465 to 424 BC.
* The fortress of Susa served as the Persian king’s winter palace.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 1:1

## Nehemiah 1:1–2.20 (id: 22423)

When Nehemiah heard about Jerusalem's ruins, he prayed for God's help ([Nehemiah 1:1–11](https://ref.ly/Neh1:1-Neh1:11)) and asked the king to send him to Jerusalem ([2:1–8](https://ref.ly/Neh2:1-Neh2:8)). Upon arrival, he urged the people to rebuild the city's wall ([Nehemiah 2:11–20](https://ref.ly/Neh2:11-Neh2:20)).

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 1:1–NEH 2:20

## Nehemiah 1:2 (id: 22427)

* Hanani might have been one of Nehemiah’s actual brothers. In Hebrew, this word can also mean a fellow countryman (for example, [Deuteronomy 1:16](https://ref.ly/Deut1:16)).
* *the remnant of the Jews who had survived the exile*: See [Ezra 2:64–65](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:64-Ezra2:65); [8:1–14](https://ref.ly/Ezra8:1-Ezra8:14).

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 1:2

## Nehemiah 1:3 (id: 22428)

* *The wall of Jerusalem is broken down*: This likely refers to a recent event in Jerusalem (see [Ezra 4:6–23](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:6-Ezra4:23)), not the Babylonian conquest in 586 BC.
* disgrace: Foreigners could mock the destroyed city, claiming it showed that Israel’s God was too weak to protect it (compare [Joel 2:17](https://ref.ly/Joel2:17); [Micah 7:8–10](https://ref.ly/Mic7:8-Mic7:10)).

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 1:3

## Nehemiah 1:4 (id: 22429)

Nehemiah mourned, fasted, and prayed for about four months (compare [Nehemiah 1:1](https://ref.ly/Neh1:1); [2:1](https://ref.ly/Neh2:1)), deeply worried about Jerusalem.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 1:4

## Nehemiah 1:5–11 (id: 22430)

Nehemiah’s prayer includes: 

* Praise ([Nehemiah 1:5](https://ref.ly/Neh1:5))
* Confession ([Nehemiah 1:6–7](https://ref.ly/Neh1:6-Neh1:7))
* Remembering God’s promises ([Nehemiah 1:8–9](https://ref.ly/Neh1:8-Neh1:9))
* A request ([Nehemiah 1:10–11](https://ref.ly/Neh1:10-Neh1:11))

Nehemiah understood that Israel’s situation was not due to God failing His covenant of unfailing love. Instead, Israel’s ongoing sin led to the punishments described in the covenant.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 1:5–NEH 1:11

## Nehemiah 1:6 (id: 22431)

*I confess the sins that we Israelites have committed*: Like Ezra ([Ezra 9:5–15](https://ref.ly/Ezra9:5-Ezra9:15)) and Daniel ([Daniel 9:4–19](https://ref.ly/Dan9:4-Dan9:19)), Nehemiah identified with his people's sins. He made no excuses and accepted his own responsibility and that of the larger covenant group that had sinned against God.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 1:6

## Nehemiah 1:8–9 (id: 22432)

* Nehemiah remembers God's curse on sin and his promise to restore ([Deuteronomy 4:25–31](https://ref.ly/Deut4:25-Deut4:31); [30:1–5](https://ref.ly/Deut30:1-Deut30:5)).
* *T**he place...for My Name* was Jerusalem.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 1:8–NEH 1:9

## Nehemiah 1:10 (id: 22424)

Nehemiah refers to God's long\-standing covenant with the Israelites. God rescued them during the exodus ([Deuteronomy 9:29](https://ref.ly/Deut9:29)) and made them his servants.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 1:10

## Nehemiah 1:11 (id: 22425)

* *grant him mercy in the sight of this man*: Nehemiah knew God could make the king kind to him.
* As a cup\-bearer, Nehemiah tasted the king’s wine to ensure it was safe. This role gave him daily access to King Artaxerxes.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 1:11

## Nehemiah 2:1 (id: 22492)

*never been sad in his presence*: A servant should not let personal issues affect serving the king.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 2:1

## Nehemiah 2:2 (id: 22494)

Nehemiah felt scared because he showed his sadness and did not know how the king would react if he explained why he was upset. King Artaxerxes had earlier ordered that Jerusalem should not be rebuilt ([Ezra 4:21–22](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:21-Ezra4:22)). Nehemiah was not pretending; his deep mourning was visible despite his efforts to hide it.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 2:2

## Nehemiah 2:3 (id: 22495)

Nehemiah showed his loyalty by saying, *May the king live forever!* (compare [Daniel 2:4](https://ref.ly/Dan2:4)), but he still admitted his sadness.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 2:3

## Nehemiah 2:4 (id: 22496)

*What is your request?*: The king followed the God of heaven*,* and Nehemiah needed God's guidance and help for his request.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 2:4

## Nehemiah 2:5 (id: 22497)

*send me to Judah...so that I may rebuild it*: Artaxerxes’ willingness to consider this proposal is surprising given Jerusalem’s history of rebellions against Persia ([Ezra 4:17–23](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:17-Ezra4:23)). The king might have seen Nehemiah’s plan as a way to strengthen his control over a problematic area of his empire.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 2:5

## Nehemiah 2:6 (id: 22498)

*How long will your journey take* (see [Ezra 5:14](https://ref.ly/Neh5:14)): Nehemiah likely asked for a short time at first and later requested more time.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 2:6

## Nehemiah 2:8 (id: 22499)

* Temple fortress might mean the Tower of Hananel or the Tower of the Hundred.
* *the gracious hand of my God was upon me*: Nehemiah understood that God guided the king to grant these requests.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 2:8

## Nehemiah 2:9 (id: 22500)

Nehemiah was a government official, so officers and horsemen escorted him to Jerusalem (compare [Ezra 8:22](https://ref.ly/Ezra8:22)).

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 2:9

## Nehemiah 2:10 (id: 22485)

* Some local non\-Jewish officials were unhappy because rebuilding Jerusalem's walls would shift political power to the Jews.
* Sanballat led the opposition to Nehemiah's rebuilding efforts.
* *the Horonite*: He was likely from Upper or Lower Horon (Beth\-horon, [Joshua 16:3](https://ref.ly/Josh16:3)), about 19 kilometers (12 miles) northwest of Jerusalem. Sanballat's name suggests he might have descended from the Assyrians brought by Sargon II after Samaria's fall ([2 Kings 17:24](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:24)). A document found in Egypt shows he became Samaria's governor in 408 BC.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 2:10

## Nehemiah 2:12–15 (id: 22486)

Nehemiah needed to see the walls himself to make strong plans for rebuilding and to gather the workers he needed. He secretly checked the walls at night to avoid being seen by his enemies. He only inspected the southern part of the city.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 2:12–NEH 2:15

## Nehemiah 2:13 (id: 22487)

* Jackal’s Well might have been En\-rogel, a water source about 365 meters (400 yards) south of the city, or the Pool of Siloam, which fills with water from Hezekiah’s winding tunnel.
* The Dung Gate, called *the Potsherd Gate* in [Jeremiah 19:2](https://ref.ly/Jer19:2), is at the southern end of the western wall (see [Nehemiah 3:13](https://ref.ly/Neh3:13)) and led to the Hinnom Valley, where city inhabitants threw their garbage.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 2:13

## Nehemiah 2:14 (id: 22488)

The King’s Pool was likely the Pool of Siloam or another pool southeast of the city. Both pools were made from the overflow of the Gihon Spring (see [2 Kings 20:20](https://ref.ly/2Kgs20:20)).

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 2:14

## Nehemiah 2:16–17 (id: 22489)

* Nehemiah kept his inspection and rebuilding plans secret from both the Persian and Jewish leaders to prevent organized opposition. Now, Nehemiah was ready to lead the rebuilding effort.
* *the trouble we are in*: The broken walls brought disgrace to the city and reflected poorly on God. Jerusalem certainly did not resemble *the city of the great King* ([Psalm 48:2](https://ref.ly/Ps48:2)).

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 2:16–NEH 2:17

## Nehemiah 2:18 (id: 22490)

Clear evidence of God's involvement ([Nehemiah 2:8](https://ref.ly/Neh2:8)) strongly motivates any project. Nehemiah had God's guidance, the king's permission, the letters needed to get lumber, and a plan to lead the project. As a result, the people eagerly agreed to start working.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 2:18

## Nehemiah 2:19 (id: 22491)

* Nehemiah’s enemies quickly mocked and tried to halt progress. These opponents were dangerous because they could discourage the people and damage Nehemiah’s credibility.
* *Are you rebelling against the king?*: This serious accusation could lead to death (see also [Ezra 4:6–23](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:6-Ezra4:23)).

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 2:19

## Nehemiah 2:20 (id: 22493)

The title *God of heaven* showed Persian audiences that Israel's true God was not just a local god. Nehemiah focused on obeying his ruler by building the walls.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 2:20

## Nehemiah 3:1 (id: 22510)

* Eliashib, the high priest and grandson of Jeshua ([Nehemiah 12:10](https://ref.ly/Neh12:10)), led the priests in repairing the northern wall around the temple.
* The Sheep Gate was where people brought sheep for sacrifice at the temple.
* The Tower of the Hundred and the Tower of Hananel were two major military towers along the northern wall ([Nehemiah 12:39](https://ref.ly/Neh12:39); [Jeremiah 31:38](https://ref.ly/Jer31:38); [Zechariah 14:10](https://ref.ly/Zech14:10)).

## Nehemiah 3:5 (id: 22516)

Geshem, who controlled the area south of Tekoa, might have influenced Tekoa's leaders ([Nehemiah 2:19](https://ref.ly/Neh2:19)).

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 3:6

## Nehemiah 3:11 (id: 22503)

## Nehemiah 3:15 (id: 22507)

* The Mizpah district was about ten kilometers (six miles) north of Jerusalem.
* The king’s garden was a lush area east of the pool of Siloam. It was near the meeting point of the Kidron and Hinnom Valleys, possibly at the King’s Pool ([Nehemiah 2:14](https://ref.ly/Neh2:14)).

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 3:15

## Nehemiah 3:16 (id: 22509)

* The district of Beth\-zur was just north of Hebron.
* The tombs of David’s family might refer to where King David was buried ([1 Kings 2:10](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:10); [11:43](https://ref.ly/1Kgs11:43); [2 Chronicles 21:20](https://ref.ly/2Chr21:20); [Acts 2:29](https://ref.ly/Acts2:29)). The House of the Mighty might have been a tomb for David’s mighty men ([2 Samuel 23:8–39](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:8-2Sam23:39)).

## Nehemiah 4:2 (id: 22530)

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 4:5

## Nehemiah 4:7 (id: 22534)

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 4:13

## Nehemiah 4:14 (id: 22525)

The greatest reason for hope was Israel’s powerful and glorious God, who had saved them from strong nations before (compare [2 Chronicles 32:7–8](https://ref.ly/2Chr32:7-2Chr32:8); [Exodus 14:13–14](https://ref.ly/Exod14:13-Exod14:14); [Deuteronomy 8:1–3](https://ref.ly/Deut8:1-Deut8:3); [20:3](https://ref.ly/Deut20:3); [Joshua 10:25](https://ref.ly/Josh10:25)). Another reason was to protect their families and properties.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 4:14

## Nehemiah 4:15 (id: 22526)

Nehemiah credited God (see also [Nehemiah 2:20](https://ref.ly/Neh2:20); [6:16](https://ref.ly/Neh6:16)). God had thwarted them through the people's prayers, the 24\-hour patrol, the visible show of force, and confidence in God's protection.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 4:15

## Nehemiah 4:18–19 (id: 22527)

Nehemiah used the trumpeter to sound the alarm and direct workers to any part of the wall under attack.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 4:20

## Nehemiah 4:23 (id: 22529)

Nehemiah and the other leaders were not elitists who rested while others worked hard.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 4:23

## Nehemiah 5:1–13 (id: 22536)

Severe financial problems almost stopped the wall's completion ([Nehemiah 5:1–5](https://ref.ly/Neh5:1-Neh5:5)), but Nehemiah found a solution ([5:6–13](https://ref.ly/Neh5:6-Neh5:13)).

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 5:1–NEH 5:13

## Nehemiah 5:2 (id: 22544)

Some farmers stopped growing crops to help build the wall. This left their large families needing food. Someone had to feed their families, or the farmers would stop working on the wall and return to their fields.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 5:2

## Nehemiah 5:3 (id: 22545)

Some small landowners had mortgaged everything to survive. The famine worsened the problem because grain was scarce and food prices naturally rose.

*pay the king’s tax*: Despite the famine, the Persians did not cancel the heavy royal taxes due at harvest time.

## Nehemiah 5:5 (id: 22547)

## Nehemiah 5:6–7 (id: 22548)

Nehemiah was very angry, but he controlled himself. He thought it over and then spoke to resolve the conflict instead of worsening it (see [James 1:19–20](https://ref.ly/Jas1:19-Jas1:20)).

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 5:6–NEH 5:7

## Nehemiah 5:9 (id: 22549)

* *walk in the fear of our God*: See [Leviticus 25:35–43](https://ref.ly/Lev25:35-Lev25:43).
* *avoid the reproach*: See also [Nehemiah 1:3](https://ref.ly/Neh1:3); [2:19](https://ref.ly/Neh2:19); [4:1–3](https://ref.ly/Neh4:1-Neh4:3).

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 5:9

## Nehemiah 5:10 (id: 22537)

*I...have been lending*: Nehemiah and his associates made loans without burdening people. Nehemiah’s example was to give financial help without causing more debt by charging interest (see [Deuteronomy 15:7–11](https://ref.ly/Deut15:7-Deut15:11)).

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 5:10

## Nehemiah 5:11 (id: 22538)

Nehemiah demanded that the wealthy lenders return the fields and repay the interest (literally *the hundredth part*), which they should not have collected (see also [Exodus 22:25](https://ref.ly/Exod22:25); [Leviticus 25:35–37](https://ref.ly/Lev25:35-Lev25:37)). The term *hundredth part* suggests the interest was one percent per month. This was lower than the 20 percent annual rate found in some documents of that time, or the 60 percent annual rate charged at Elephantine in Egypt. However, even a low interest rate violated God's covenant.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 5:11

## Nehemiah 5:12 (id: 22539)

*required of the nobles and officials an oath*: Both God and the community would hold them accountable.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 5:12

* This is the first time Nehemiah is mentioned as governor. The king did not mention this role when he first sent Nehemiah to Jerusalem.

This section explains Nehemiah's steady approach to servant leadership and his personal generosity.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 5:14–NEH 5:19

## Nehemiah 5:15 (id: 22542)

The former governors were likely Nehemiah’s immediate predecessors, not Sheshbazzar ([Ezra 1:8](https://ref.ly/Ezra1:8), around 90 years earlier) or Zerubbabel ([Haggai 1:1](https://ref.ly/Hag1:1), around 80 years earlier).

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 5:15

## Nehemiah 5:19 (id: 22543)

Nehemiah prayed for God to remember and bless him, showing his reliance on God.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 5:19

## Nehemiah 6:1–19 (id: 22550)

After solving the financial crisis (see [Nehemiah 5](https://ref.ly/Neh5:1-Neh5:19)), the story shifts back to how those against rebuilding tried to scare or stop Nehemiah.

## Nehemiah 6:2 (id: 22553)

The plain of Ono, located near Lod ([Ezra 2:33](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:33)), was likely a neutral site west of Jerusalem. Nehemiah would have been unprotected there.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 6:2

## Nehemiah 6:6–7 (id: 22554)

* *plotting to revolt...become their king*: Those who opposed rebuilding the temple used similar tactics (see [Ezra 4](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:1-Ezra4:24)).
* At times in Israel's history, prophets helped establish a new king (compare [1 Samuel 9:16](https://ref.ly/1Sam9:16); [2 Kings 9](https://ref.ly/2Kgs9:1-2Kgs9:37)).

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 6:6–NEH 6:7

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 7:2

## Nehemiah 7:3 (id: 22558)

The gatekeepers were meant to close the gates in the afternoon when people rested and were not ready to defend the city. In other texts, similar language describes the hottest part of the day when people go inside ([Genesis 18:1](https://ref.ly/Gen18:1); [2 Samuel 4:5](https://ref.ly/2Sam4:5)).

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 7:3

## Nehemiah 7:4–5 (id: 22559)

Most people lived in the countryside near their fields, so Jerusalem's population was small. A registration would likely encourage more people to settle in and near Jerusalem ([Nehemiah 7:73](https://ref.ly/Neh7:73)).

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 7:4–NEH 7:5

## Nehemiah 7:6 (id: 22564)

*the exiles...returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his own town*: These lists were incomplete (the individual numbers do not match the total in [Nehemiah 7:66](https://ref.ly/Neh7:66)), but they were the best records available to verify Jewish identity.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 7:6

## Nehemiah 7:7 (id: 22568)

*accompanied by*: Sheshbazzar (see [Ezra 1:8](https://ref.ly/Ezra1:8)) is not mentioned here and in [Ezra 2:2](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:2). This suggests both lists were made after the people settled in their towns and after Sheshbazzar died.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 7:7

## Nehemiah 7:8–38 (id: 22569)

*the descendants of*: This list is similar to the one in [Ezra 2:3–35](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:3-Ezra2:35), but there are some differences in names and family sizes. People were listed by family ([Nehemiah 7:8–25](https://ref.ly/Neh7:8-Neh7:25)) and by the town where they settled ([7:26–38](https://ref.ly/Neh7:26-Neh7:38)). Most of these towns were north of Jerusalem.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 7:8–NEH 7:38

The descendants of Solomon’s servants likely helped the Levites by carrying wood or sweeping the floor (see [Ezra 2:55–58](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:55-Ezra2:58)). They might have been Gibeonites (see [Joshua 9:23–27](https://ref.ly/Josh9:23-Josh9:27); [1 Chronicles 9:35–44](https://ref.ly/1Chr9:35-1Chr9:44)) or war captives (see [Numbers 31:30–47](https://ref.ly/Num31:30-Num31:47)).

## Nehemiah 7:66 (id: 22563)

The total number 42,360 matches [Ezra 2:64](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:64), but the family numbers add up to only 31,089\. The family numbers might not include young children, or the list might be incomplete.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 7:66

This money added to gifts from Israelites who remained in Babylon ([Ezra 1:6](https://ref.ly/Ezra1:6)) and from the Persian kings ([Ezra 6:8](https://ref.ly/Ezra6:8)).

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 7:70–NEH 7:72

## Nehemiah 8:1 (id: 22575)

The Water Gate was in the middle of Jerusalem's eastern wall, south of the temple and east of the palace ruins ([Nehemiah 3:26](https://ref.ly/Neh3:26); [12:37](https://ref.ly/Neh12:37)). There was a lot of open space, ensuring everyone could gather there.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 8:1

## Nehemiah 8:2 (id: 22576)

*On the first day of the seventh month*: The people gathered to celebrate the Festival of Trumpets ([Leviticus 23:24–25](https://ref.ly/Lev23:24-Lev23:25)), marking the start of a new year in the calendar from after the exile in Babylon.

## Nehemiah 8:3 (id: 22577)

* The time from early morning until noon allowed about six hours for reading and interpreting ([Nehemiah 8:7–8](https://ref.ly/Neh8:7-Neh8:8)).
* *understand* (see also [Nehemiah 8:2](https://ref.ly/Neh8:2), [8](https://ref.ly/Neh8:8), [12](https://ref.ly/Neh8:12)): This was more than a ritual reading of the law. It included explanations, insights, and applications.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 8:3

## Nehemiah 8:4 (id: 22578)

* *Amen!* This is a statement of agreement (see [Nehemiah 5:13](https://ref.ly/Neh5:13)). Lifting hands ([Psalm 28:2](https://ref.ly/Ps28:2)) and bowing in humble worship showed reverence for God and submission to his word.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 8:6

## Nehemiah 8:7–9 (id: 22581)

The Levites were responsible for teaching people God’s word ([Deuteronomy 33:10](https://ref.ly/Deut33:10); [Malachi 2:5–6](https://ref.ly/Mal2:5-Mal2:6)). They likely explained the Hebrew Scriptures to smaller groups in Aramaic. Most people spoke Aramaic, the language of Babylon, instead of Hebrew as their first language. Jewish leaders later translated large parts of the Hebrew Bible into Aramaic, so people could hear and study the Bible in a language they understood.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 8:7–NEH 8:9

## Nehemiah 8:9–10 (id: 22582)

* *Ezra the priest and scribe*: See study note on Ezra 7:6.
* *This day is holy to the LORD your God. Do not mourn or weep*: God moved the people's hearts, leading them to regret not following his laws. While weeping is a suitable reaction to sin (see [Ezekiel 9:4](https://ref.ly/Ezek9:4); [Luke 6:21](https://ref.ly/Luke6:21)), Ezra and Nehemiah urged the people to celebrate what God had done. This New Year's festival was meant to be joyful ([Numbers 29:1–6](https://ref.ly/Num29:1-Num29:6)), and weeping would have ruined the day's spirit.

This prayer reminded the people of God's miraculous guidance of Israel in the wilderness ([Exodus 13:21–22](https://ref.ly/Exod13:21-Exod13:22)), his personal appearance at Mount Sinai to reveal his covenant laws through Moses (see [Exodus 19–20](https://ref.ly/Exod19:1-Exod20:26)), and his faithfulness in providing bread and water (see [Exodus 16:4](https://ref.ly/Exod16:4); [17:1–6](https://ref.ly/Exod17:1-Exod17:6)).

* Redemption money of five shekels for the oldest sons and the firstborn of all herds and flocks (see [Exodus 13:13](https://ref.ly/Exod13:13); [34:20](https://ref.ly/Exod34:20); [Numbers 18:15–17](https://ref.ly/Num18:15-Num18:17))
* A tenth of everything (see [Numbers 18:21–24](https://ref.ly/Num18:21-Num18:24); [Deuteronomy 14:22–29](https://ref.ly/Deut14:22-Deut14:29))

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 10:35–NEH 10:37

## Nehemiah 10:37–39 (id: 22442)

The Levites gathered tithes in all the rural towns and sent one\-tenth of that collection to the temple in Jerusalem (see [Numbers 18:25–32](https://ref.ly/Num18:25-Num18:32)).

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 10:37–NEH 10:39

## Nehemiah 11:1–2 (id: 22443)

Sacred lots were likely the Urim and Thummim ([Nehemiah 10:34](https://ref.ly/Neh10:34); [Joshua 7:14](https://ref.ly/Josh7:14), [16–18](https://ref.ly/Josh7:16-Josh7:18); [14:2](https://ref.ly/Josh14:2)).

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 11:1–NEH 11:2

## Nehemiah 11:1–36 (id: 22444)

The story goes back to the topic of bringing people back to live in the safe city of Jerusalem (see [Nehemiah 7:1–5](https://ref.ly/Neh7:1-Neh7:5)). The list of names is similar to the one in [1 Chronicles 9:2–17](https://ref.ly/1Chr9:2-1Chr9:17).

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 11:1–NEH 11:36

## Nehemiah 11:4 (id: 22450)

Perez was a son of Judah ([Genesis 38:29](https://ref.ly/Gen38:29)).

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 11:4

## Nehemiah 11:16 (id: 22445)

Outside the temple, the work likely involved collecting tithes from people and managing them in storehouses ([Nehemiah 10:37–39](https://ref.ly/Neh10:37-Neh10:39); see also [1 Chronicles 26:29](https://ref.ly/1Chr26:29)).

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 11:16

## Nehemiah 11:17 (id: 22446)

*the son of Asaph*: David selected Asaph and his sons to create music for temple worship ([1 Chronicles 25:1–8](https://ref.ly/1Chr25:1-1Chr25:8)). Asaph's descendants resumed this role when the new temple was built.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 11:17

## Nehemiah 11:21 (id: 22447)

The hill of Ophel was high ground just south of the temple ([Nehemiah 3:26](https://ref.ly/Neh3:26)). It was a perfect place for housing temple workers.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 11:21

## Nehemiah 11:24 (id: 22448)

The royal adviser told the king about events in Jerusalem and informed Jewish officials about the king's management of Persian policies.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 11:24

## Nehemiah 11:30 (id: 22449)

*from Beersheba all the way to the Valley of Hinnom*: Earlier descriptions of where people settled focused on areas north of Jerusalem ([Nehemiah 3](https://ref.ly/Neh3:1-Neh3:32); [11:31–36](https://ref.ly/Neh11:31-Neh11:36)). This list ([Nehemiah 11:25–30](https://ref.ly/Neh11:25-Neh11:30)) shows the expansion of places where Jewish people lived as they returned to many of their towns from before the exile, both north and south of Jerusalem.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 11:30

## Nehemiah 12:1–9 (id: 22452)

*priests and Levites who went up with Zerubbabel...with Jeshua*: See [Ezra 1:1–5](https://ref.ly/Ezra1:1-Ezra1:5). Only those who could prove their priestly lineage could serve at the temple. Therefore, maintaining an accurate genealogical record of these families was important.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 12:1–NEH 12:9

## Nehemiah 12:1–26 (id: 22451)

These lists of priests and Levites include those who originally returned from exile with Zerubbabel ([Nehemiah 12:1–9](https://ref.ly/Neh12:1-Neh12:9)), a chronological list of high priests ([12:10–11](https://ref.ly/Neh12:10-Neh12:11)), and the priests and Levites who served during Joiakim's time, the high priest during Nehemiah and Ezra's era ([12:12–26](https://ref.ly/Neh12:12-Neh12:26)).

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 12:1–NEH 12:26

## Nehemiah 12:7 (id: 22465)

* *leaders of the priests*: Compare [Ezra 2:36–39](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:36-Ezra2:39).
* Jeshua was the high priest in Jerusalem when the people returned from captivity shortly after 538 BC ([Ezra 2:2](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:2); [3:2](https://ref.ly/Ezra3:2), [8](https://ref.ly/Ezra3:8); [4:3](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:3)). He continued serving in 520 BC when Haggai and Zechariah encouraged the people to complete the temple ([Ezra 5:1](https://ref.ly/Ezra5:1); [Haggai 1:1](https://ref.ly/Hag1:1); [Zechariah 3:1](https://ref.ly/Zech3:1)).

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 12:7

## Nehemiah 12:8–9 (id: 22466)

*their associates, stood across*: To perform antiphonal singing (a call\-and\-response style) as described in [Nehemiah 12:24](https://ref.ly/Neh12:24) and [Ezra 3:1–11](https://ref.ly/Ezra3:1-Ezra3:11).

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 12:8–NEH 12:9

## Nehemiah 12:10–11 (id: 22453)

* Joiakim likely served during the early years of Ezra's service.
* Eliashib and Joiada served during Nehemiah's time ([Nehemiah 3:1](https://ref.ly/Neh3:1); [13:4](https://ref.ly/Neh13:4), [28](https://ref.ly/Neh13:28)).
* *Jonathan*: An Aramaic papyrus document from a Jewish colony in Elephantine, Egypt (around 410 BC). Josephus (*Antiquities* 11\.5\.4, AD 93\) also mentions Jonathan serving after Nehemiah's time.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 12:10–NEH 12:11

## Nehemiah 12:12–21 (id: 22454)

This list was likely compiled when Joiakim was the high priest ([Nehemiah 12:12](https://ref.ly/Neh12:12)) to confirm the legitimacy of the priests and Levites in office. Except for the omission of Hattush (see [Nehemiah 12:2](https://ref.ly/Neh12:2)), this list includes the same names as [Nehemiah 12:1–7](https://ref.ly/Neh12:1-Neh12:7).

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 12:12–NEH 12:21

## Nehemiah 12:27–29 (id: 22455)

* Since few Levites had returned to live in Jerusalem (see [Ezra 2:40–42](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:40-Ezra2:42); [8:15–19](https://ref.ly/Ezra8:15-Ezra8:19)), leaders recruited all Levites throughout the land to form two impressive choirs and orchestras.
* Netophathites came from near Bethlehem ([1 Chronicles 2:54](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:54)).
* Beth\-gilgal was near Jericho.
* Geba and Azmaveth were in the territory of Benjamin.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 12:27–NEH 12:29

## Nehemiah 12:27–43 (id: 22456)

The dedication of the new wall likely occurred soon after it was finished ([Nehemiah 6:15–19](https://ref.ly/Neh6:15-Neh6:19)). This account likely came from Nehemiah’s personal writings.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 12:27–NEH 12:43

## Nehemiah 12:30 (id: 22457)

The dedication ceremony required the priests and Levites to be purified and ready to enter the temple area (see [Exodus 19:10](https://ref.ly/Exod19:10); [Numbers 8:5–7](https://ref.ly/Num8:5-Num8:7)).

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 12:30

## Nehemiah 12:31–37 (id: 22458)

The impressive march moved south along the top of the wall to the Dung Gate at the city's southern end ([Nehemiah 3:13–14](https://ref.ly/Neh3:13-Neh3:14)). Then the procession went north on the wall along the east side of the city, past the ruins of the house of David, and up to the Water Gate ([Nehemiah 3:26](https://ref.ly/Neh3:26); [8:1](https://ref.ly/Neh8:1)) near the temple.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 12:31–NEH 12:37

## Nehemiah 12:35 (id: 22459)

Long, slender, metal trumpets were played for joyful celebrations ([1 Chronicles 13:8](https://ref.ly/1Chr13:8); [15:23](https://ref.ly/1Chr15:23); [16:6](https://ref.ly/1Chr16:6), [42](https://ref.ly/1Chr16:42); [Ezra 3:10](https://ref.ly/Ezra3:10)) by Asaph's descendants.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 12:35

## Nehemiah 12:38–39 (id: 22460)

* The second choir went north along the western wall, passing:

    + The Broad Wall ([Nehemiah 3:8](https://ref.ly/Neh3:8))
        + The Old City Gate ([Nehemiah 3:6](https://ref.ly/Neh3:6))
        + The Fish Gate ([Nehemiah 3:3](https://ref.ly/Neh3:3))
        They continued along the northern side of the wall until they reached the *Sheep Gate* ([Nehemiah 3:1](https://ref.ly/Neh3:1)) at the northeast corner of the temple.

* The Guard Gate might be the *Inspection Gate* ([Nehemiah 3:31](https://ref.ly/Neh3:31)).

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 12:38–NEH 12:39

## Nehemiah 12:43 (id: 22461)

This community celebration included everyone. God was the true source of their great joy because his power helped them rebuild the walls. [Psalm 147](https://ref.ly/Ps147:1-Ps147:20) might have been written for this occasion.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 12:43

## Nehemiah 12:44–47 (id: 22462)

On the day of the wall's dedication ([Nehemiah 12:44](https://ref.ly/Neh12:44); [13:1](https://ref.ly/Neh13:1)), men were appointed to manage the tithes and gifts for the priests and Levites' needs. Their duties included collecting people's gifts for the priests and Levites ([Nehemiah 10:32–39](https://ref.ly/Neh10:32-Neh10:39); see also [Exodus 30:11–16](https://ref.ly/Exod30:11-Exod30:16); [38:25–26](https://ref.ly/Exod38:25-Exod38:26)), performing services for God (probably sacrifices; see [Leviticus 1–5](https://ref.ly/Lev1:1-Lev5:19)), and overseeing the purification of unclean people. They also purified pans, knives, and clothing used in temple worship as described in [Leviticus 11–15](https://ref.ly/Lev11:1-Lev15:33) (see also [1 Chronicles 23:28](https://ref.ly/1Chr23:28)).

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 12:44–NEH 12:47

## Nehemiah 12:46 (id: 22463)

David gave instructions for organizing the music at the temple ([1 Chronicles 23–26](https://ref.ly/1Chr23:1-1Chr26:32)). He put Asaph, along with Heman and Jeduthun, in charge of the music ([1 Chronicles 25:2–5](https://ref.ly/1Chr25:2-1Chr25:5)).

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 12:46

## Nehemiah 12:47 (id: 22464)

From the time the first people returned to Jerusalem with Zerubbabel in 538 BC ([Ezra 3:1](https://ref.ly/Ezra3:1)) until Nehemiah's time around 445 BC, Israelites provided food for temple workers. Most Levites lived in cities across the country. They collected a tithe and brought a tenth of it to the temple in Jerusalem to support its ministry (see [Nehemiah 10:38–39](https://ref.ly/Neh10:38-Neh10:39)).

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 12:47

## Nehemiah 13:1–3 (id: 22467)

On the same day the temple workers were appointed ([Nehemiah 12:44](https://ref.ly/Neh12:44)), the text from [Deuteronomy 23:3–6](https://ref.ly/Deut23:3-Deut23:6) was read. It stated that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever enter the assembly of God. Nehemiah later discovered ([Nehemiah 13:4–14](https://ref.ly/Neh13:4-Neh13:14)) that people were no longer following these teachings.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 13:1–NEH 13:3

## Nehemiah 13:4–5 (id: 22482)

Eliashib’s family married into the families of Sanballat ([Nehemiah 13:28](https://ref.ly/Neh13:28)) and Tobiah. These men were enemies of the Jewish community ([Nehemiah 2:10](https://ref.ly/Neh2:10), [19](https://ref.ly/Neh2:19); [4:1](https://ref.ly/Neh4:1)). Tobiah's use of the storeroom reduced space for storing tithes and gifts for temple workers (compare [Nehemiah 10:39](https://ref.ly/Neh10:39); [13:10–12](https://ref.ly/Neh13:10-Neh13:12); [2 Chronicles 31:11](https://ref.ly/2Chr31:11)) and limited space for supplies needed for regular worship at the temple ([Leviticus 2](https://ref.ly/Lev2:1-Lev2:16)).

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 13:4–NEH 13:5

## Nehemiah 13:4–14 (id: 22481)

Eliashib the priest (see [Nehemiah 12:10](https://ref.ly/Neh12:10), [22](https://ref.ly/Neh12:22); [13:28](https://ref.ly/Neh13:28)) had stopped excluding the Ammonites and Moabites ([13:1](https://ref.ly/Neh13:1)). The people also stopped giving their tithes to the Levites ([Nehemiah 13:10–12](https://ref.ly/Neh13:10-Neh13:12)). Nehemiah corrected these issues.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 13:4–NEH 13:14

## Nehemiah 13:6 (id: 22483)

Nehemiah went back to Persia after serving in Jerusalem for twelve years, from 445 to 433 BC. The text does not specify how long he stayed in Persia, but it was likely no more than a year or two. When he returned to Jerusalem, he discovered Tobiah living in the temple storeroom ([Nehemiah 13:1–5](https://ref.ly/Neh13:1-Neh13:5)).

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 13:6

## Nehemiah 13:8–9 (id: 22484)

* *I was greatly displeased...I ordered*: When people rejected God's instructions, Nehemiah spoke up.
* Everything related to the temple had to be purified and dedicated to God. This included:

    + The clothes that the priests and Levites wore ([Exodus 29](https://ref.ly/Exod29:1-Exod29:46))
        + The priests themselves ([Leviticus 8–9](https://ref.ly/Lev8:1-Lev9:24))
        + The temple building and altars ([Leviticus 16:15–33](https://ref.ly/Lev16:15-Lev16:33))
        + All the holy items ([1 Chronicles 23:28](https://ref.ly/1Chr23:28))
        They were all purified (compare [2 Chronicles 29:5](https://ref.ly/2Chr29:5), [15–19](https://ref.ly/2Chr29:15-2Chr29:19)).

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 13:8–NEH 13:9

## Nehemiah 13:10–12 (id: 22468)

Because Tobiah used the storeroom, there was no space to store tithes for feeding the Levites and temple singers ([Numbers 18:21–24](https://ref.ly/Num18:21-Num18:24); see [Nehemiah 12:44](https://ref.ly/Neh12:44), [47](https://ref.ly/Neh12:47)). They had to farm outside Jerusalem ([Nehemiah 12:28–29](https://ref.ly/Neh12:28-Neh12:29)) to support themselves and could not serve in the temple.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 13:10–NEH 13:12

## Nehemiah 13:13 (id: 22469)

*they were considered trustworthy*: Compare [Acts 6:1–6](https://ref.ly/Acts6:1-Acts6:6).

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 13:13

## Nehemiah 13:14 (id: 22470)

Nehemiah asked God to remember his good deeds and not abandon him when he needed help. He likely faced opposition from those he corrected. See similar mentions in [Nehemiah 13:22](https://ref.ly/Neh13:22), [29](https://ref.ly/Neh13:29), [31](https://ref.ly/Neh13:31).

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 13:14

## Nehemiah 13:15–16 (id: 22471)

People were to stop working on the Sabbath to keep it holy ([Exodus 20:8–11](https://ref.ly/Exod20:8-Exod20:11); [31:14–17](https://ref.ly/Exod31:14-Exod31:17); [35:2–3](https://ref.ly/Exod35:2-Exod35:3); [Jeremiah 17:19–27](https://ref.ly/Jer17:19-Jer17:27)).

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 13:15–NEH 13:16

## Nehemiah 13:15–31 (id: 22472)

Nehemiah made two more changes to bring back correct Sabbath observance ([Nehemiah 13:15–22](https://ref.ly/Neh13:15-Neh13:22)) and correct marriage practices ([13:23–31](https://ref.ly/Neh13:23-Neh13:31)). These two sections follow a similar pattern: Nehemiah found a problem, fixed it, and then asked God for a blessing.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 13:15–NEH 13:31

## Nehemiah 13:19 (id: 22473)

The Sabbath starts at sunset on Friday evening and ends at sunset on Saturday evening.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 13:19

## Nehemiah 13:22 (id: 22474)

*show me mercy*: Nehemiah's prayer suggests he felt the pressure of this unpopular decision. He knew God's unfailing love, not his popularity, would sustain him.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 13:22

## Nehemiah 13:23–24 (id: 22475)

The earlier marriage reforms ([Nehemiah 9:2](https://ref.ly/Neh9:2); [10:28](https://ref.ly/Neh10:28); [Ezra 9:1–10:44](https://ref.ly/Ezra9:1-Ezra10:44)) did not last. The children could not speak Hebrew, the language of Judah. This was disastrous because they could not read or understand the Scriptures.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 13:23–NEH 13:24

## Nehemiah 13:25 (id: 22476)

* Nehemiah cursed them because the parents avoided Hebrew and did not teach their children the language of the Hebrew Bible. A curse asked God to remove his blessing from people.
* *I beat some of these men and pulled out their hair*: Some men did not accept Nehemiah’s rebuke at first, so he made them swear in the name of God not to marry pagans.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 13:25

## Nehemiah 13:26–27 (id: 22477)

King Solomon led the nation into sin through his foreign wives ([1 Kings 11](https://ref.ly/1Kgs11:1-1Kgs11:43)). If intermarriage with non\-believers continued, the community would face the same downfall. Nehemiah would not allow that.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 13:26–NEH 13:27

## Nehemiah 13:28 (id: 22478)

Even the family of the high priest, who were meant to be Israel’s spiritual leaders, participated in the sin of intermarriage with unbelieving foreigners (compare [Leviticus 21:14](https://ref.ly/Lev21:14)). Nehemiah banished the offender, stripping him of status and removing his rights in the Jewish community.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 13:28

## Nehemiah 13:29 (id: 22479)

*Remember them, O my God*: Many likely resented Nehemiah's strong stance against intermarriage in the high priest's family. He prayed for God's judgment on these spiritual leaders who defiled the priesthood.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 13:29

## Nehemiah 13:30–31 (id: 22480)

These final verses summarize Nehemiah’s reform. Nehemiah ensured the people kept their promises. He held them accountable and did not accept half\-hearted efforts.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 13:30–NEH 13:31
