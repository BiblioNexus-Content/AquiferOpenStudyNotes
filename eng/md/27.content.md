## Daniel 1:1 (id: 9883)

Prior to this siege, Jehoiakim (609–598 BC) had been a vassal of Egypt; his reign in Judah was exceedingly wicked ([2 Kgs 23:36–24:6](https://ref.ly/2Kgs23:36-2Kgs24:6); [2 Chr 36:5–8](https://ref.ly/2Chr36:5-2Chr36:8); [Jer 25](https://ref.ly/Jer25:1-Jer25:38)). The exile and captivity of Daniel and his friends in 605 BC prefigure the exile of the rest of the nation in 597 and 586 BC (see [2 Kgs 24:1–25:21](https://ref.ly/2Kgs24:1-2Kgs25:21)). The Lord employed King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon as his unwitting servant to accomplish his ends (cp. [Jer 25:9](https://ref.ly/Jer25:9); [27:6](https://ref.ly/Jer27:6)).

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 1:1

## Daniel 1:1–2 (id: 9874)

These verses explain how it was that Daniel and his friends were in Babylon and succinctly give the setting in which Daniel lived during the years of exile.

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 1:1–DAN 1:2

## Daniel 1:1–21 (id: 9873)

God fulfilled his prophetic word by sending his rebellious people into exile (see [Jer 25:11–12](https://ref.ly/Jer25:11-Jer25:12); [29:10](https://ref.ly/Jer29:10)). God also extended his grace to a remnant in exile, and he protected and prospered Daniel and three other young Hebrew captives. These young men received the best training of the time in the Babylonian king’s court and were thus well equipped to be God’s witnesses in Babylon. They made the God of Israel known even in exile.

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 1:1–DAN 1:21

## Daniel 1:1–6.28 (id: 9875)

The first half of Daniel, in describing the experiences and wisdom of Daniel and his three Hebrew friends, demonstrates that God is the ruler of the world and that God’s people need to be faithful and live and act wisely in every situation in which they find themselves.

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 1:1

## Daniel 1:2 (id: 9886)

The Lord, who is sovereign over history, gave the victory to Nebuchadnezzar; it was not accomplished by the king’s might or the power of his god Marduk, the high god of the Babylonian pantheon. The Lord used the Exile to judge and discipline his people, as had been threatened in the Law (e.g., [Deut 28:64](https://ref.ly/Deut28:64)) and by the prophets (e.g., [Jer 25:8–14](https://ref.ly/Jer25:8-Jer25:14)). • The sacred objects had been dedicated and set aside for use in the Temple of God built by Solomon. After spending nearly seventy years in the treasure\-house of Marduk, these vessels were further defiled by Belshazzar in 539 BC ([Dan 5:1–4](https://ref.ly/Dan5:1-Dan5:4)); they were later returned to the rebuilt Temple in Ezra’s time ([Ezra 1:7–11](https://ref.ly/Ezra1:7-Ezra1:11); [5:13–16](https://ref.ly/Ezra5:13-Ezra5:16)). • the land of Babylonia: Israel’s rebellion led them back to where rebellious humanity had constructed the Tower of Babel ([Gen 11:2](https://ref.ly/Gen11:2)).

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 1:2

## Daniel 1:3 (id: 9888)

staff: Though often translated “eunuchs” (cp. [Isa 39:7](https://ref.ly/Isa39:7)), in this case the Hebrew term (saris) likely means that Ashpenaz and those under his authority were high government officials (see [2 Kgs 8:6](https://ref.ly/2Kgs8:6)).

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 1:3

## Daniel 1:3–7 (id: 9887)

The Lord fulfilled his threat to make sons of the royal family serve in Babylon ([Isa 39:7](https://ref.ly/Isa39:7)) despite their being heirs to the promises of Davidic kingship. Nebuchadnezzar made a powerful attempt to proselytize them by education, social and religious pressure, and name changes. Instead, their impact upon their pagan surroundings became the outstanding feature of their stay at the king’s palace and court.

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 1:3–DAN 1:7

## Daniel 1:4 (id: 9889)

strong, healthy: They had no defect or blemish that would disqualify them; the Lord had the same requirements for Israel’s priests ([Lev 21:16–24](https://ref.ly/Lev21:16-Lev21:24); [22:17–25](https://ref.ly/Lev22:17-Lev22:25)). These youths had the wisdom, knowledge, understanding, and character needed to function at the highest levels of government. • The literature of Babylon was immense and included wisdom and esoteric literature, creation stories, magic incantations, theogonies (origins and genealogies of the gods), legal corpora, ancient histories, letters, dream journals, vision manuals, and mathematical and astrological materials. The education of these young men—all in a foreign language—rivaled that of Moses in Egypt.

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 1:4

## Daniel 1:5 (id: 9890)

The king attempted to create a bond of dependence, gratitude, and loyalty by giving them food and wine from his own kitchens.

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 1:5

## Daniel 1:6–7 (id: 9891)

Their new Babylonian names were to help enculturate the Hebrews into the pagan Babylonian society. Daniel (“God is my Judge” or “God has judged”) became Belteshazzar (“Bel \[a Babylonian god] protects his life”). Hananiah (“the Lord is grace”) became Shadrach (possibly meaning “command of Aku,” another Babylonian god). Mishael (“who is God?”) became Meshach (“who is Aku?”). Azariah (“the Lord helps”) became Abednego (“servant of Nego/Nebo,” another Babylonian god).

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 1:6–DAN 1:7

## Daniel 1:8 (id: 9893)

Daniel was determined not to defile himself: The meat and wine from Nebuchadnezzar’s table were probably unclean by Jewish standards. The Babylonians used unclean meats such as pork (see [Lev 11:1–23](https://ref.ly/Lev11:1-Lev11:23); [Deut 14:1–21](https://ref.ly/Deut14:1-Deut14:21)), and their meat and wine had probably been dedicated to Babylonian gods. The other young Hebrews agreed with Daniel ([Dan 1:12–16](https://ref.ly/Dan1:12-Dan1:16)). They trusted God and obeyed his commands, and God blessed them (cp. [Deut 28:1–14](https://ref.ly/Deut28:1-Deut28:14)).

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 1:8

## Daniel 1:8–14 (id: 9892)

Daniel determined not to defile himself with the king’s food and wine or to yield his religious and moral independence to the king. He gave God the opportunity to demonstrate his loving kindness and care toward his trustworthy servants. This strong reliance upon God by Daniel and his friends is a significant motif throughout the book (see also [2:16–23](https://ref.ly/Dan2:16-Dan2:23); [3:16–18](https://ref.ly/Dan3:16-Dan3:18); [6:16](https://ref.ly/Dan6:16)).

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 1:8–DAN 1:14

## Daniel 1:9 (id: 9894)

God worked on Daniel’s behalf by influencing Ashpenaz’s attitude (cp. [Exod 11:3](https://ref.ly/Exod11:3)).

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 1:9

## Daniel 1:10 (id: 9876)

Ashpenaz was understandably afraid of the king.

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 1:10

## Daniel 1:11–13 (id: 9877)

Daniel found a wise solution that would protect his spiritual integrity and Ashpenaz’s head.

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 1:11–DAN 1:13

## Daniel 1:12 (id: 9878)

vegetables and water: Such a diet would steer clear of offensive foods ([1:8](https://ref.ly/Dan1:8)) and, as a kind of fast, would demonstrate mourning over their exile in a foreign land.

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 1:12

## Daniel 1:13–14 (id: 9879)

make your decision: Daniel’s exemplary wisdom, prudence, and courtesy are seen in his respectful stance toward his attendant*,* who responded favorably.

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 1:13–DAN 1:14

## Daniel 1:15–21 (id: 9880)

In their training, Daniel and his friends completed a tough curriculum in the context of the most threatening pagan culture of the day, yet they remained faithful to the Lord. As they mastered language, literature, and science, they pursued excellence and honored God, who added many gifts to their skills and learning.

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 1:15–DAN 1:21

## Daniel 1:17 (id: 9881)

All four young men were outstanding students. God gave Daniel the special ability to interpret . . . visions and dreams, which were often prophetic (cp. Joseph, [Gen 37:5–11](https://ref.ly/Gen37:5-Gen37:11)).

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 1:17

## Daniel 1:19 (id: 9882)

The king talked with all the young men who were trained, not just Daniel and his three friends. This was a thorough oral examination and discussion of things that were most important to the king. God arranged for the four young men to be his witnesses among the nations, and they were greatly honored by being appointed to positions of power, responsibility, and opportunity (cp. [Gen 41:37–40](https://ref.ly/Gen41:37-Gen41:40); [45:5](https://ref.ly/Gen45:5); [Exod 2:1–10](https://ref.ly/Exod2:1-Exod2:10)).

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 1:19

## Daniel 1:20 (id: 9884)

The magicians were a class of soothsayer priests who could also interpret dreams (cp. [Gen 44:1–15](https://ref.ly/Gen44:1-Gen44:15)) and do wonders (cp. [Exod 7:11](https://ref.ly/Exod7:11)). The term enchanters (Hebrew ’ashap), found only in Daniel, comes from an Akkadian term for people who uttered spells.

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 1:20

## Daniel 1:21 (id: 9885)

the first year of the reign of King Cyrus: Cyrus the Great ruled over Persia (559–530 BC), Media (from 549 BC), and Babylon (from 539 BC). He thus created the Persian Empire (539–331 BC; see study notes on 5:30, 31; cp. [Isa 45:1–2](https://ref.ly/Isa45:1-Isa45:2)).

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 1:21

second year: If the three\-year training period for Daniel and his friends is understood as having occurred in parts of three calendar years, it could have been completed by this time (cp. [2:48](https://ref.ly/Dan2:48)).

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 2:1

## Daniel 2:1–3 (id: 9952)

Nebuchadnezzar’s dream disturbed him so much that he called on his specially trained advisers to help him.

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 2:1–DAN 2:3

## Daniel 2:1–49 (id: 9953)

God gave a dream that encompassed the flow of world history over the centuries, and Daniel interpreted the enigmatic imagery of this revelation. This dream and its interpretation reflect a key theme of the book—the assured final establishment of the Kingdom of God as the ultimate goal of history ([2:44–45](https://ref.ly/Dan2:44-Dan2:45); [7:9–14](https://ref.ly/Dan7:9-Dan7:14), [26–27](https://ref.ly/Dan7:26-Dan7:27)). This chapter also demonstrates the inability of paganism to discern the activity and plans of Israel’s God.

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 2:1–DAN 2:49

## Daniel 2:1–6.28 (id: 9954)

This section contains stories and dreams from the experiences of Daniel and his friends in Babylon. Daniel exercised his special gift of understanding the meaning of dreams and his mastery of literature and science ([1:17](https://ref.ly/Dan1:17)). Chapter 2 gives a broad schematic view of all history until the appearance of God’s kingdom ([2:44–49](https://ref.ly/Dan2:44-Dan2:49)). Chapters[3–6](https://ref.ly/Dan3:1-Dan6:28) portray the demise of Babylon and the rise of Persia. History moves toward its inexorable goal—the everlasting Kingdom of God ([2:44](https://ref.ly/Dan2:44); [4:2–3](https://ref.ly/Dan4:2-Dan4:3), [34](https://ref.ly/Dan4:34); [6:26](https://ref.ly/Dan6:26)).

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 2:1–DAN 6:28

## Daniel 2:2 (id: 9969)

magicians, enchanters: See study note on 1:20. • Sorcerers were incantation priests or ritual technicians. • Astrologers studied the heavenly bodies to discern the times and seasons of major events.

* **Associated Articles:** Daniel 1:20 (ID: `9884@TyndaleStudyNotes`)

## Daniel 2:3 (id: 9976)

a dream that deeply troubles me: The king had reason to fear that his throne might be in danger from other groups.

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 2:3

## Daniel 2:4 (id: 9985)

Aramaic had been established by the Assyrians as the lingua franca of international communication. The practice was continued by the Babylonians. • Tell us the dream: The Babylonian wise men needed to know the contents of the dream in order to look them up in reference books. They did not depend on divine revelation.

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 2:4

## Daniel 2:9 (id: 9986)

Only someone with supernatural insight could tell Nebuchadnezzar the contents of his dream (cp. [Mark 2:9–12](https://ref.ly/Mark2:9-Mark2:12)).

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 2:9

## Daniel 2:10–11 (id: 9955)

The Babylonian wise men could possibly interpret dreams, but they could not retell them without being told, and they recognized that such a thing was only possible for divinity (cp. [2:17–23](https://ref.ly/Dan2:17-Dan2:23), [27–28](https://ref.ly/Dan2:27-Dan2:28)).

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 2:10–DAN 2:11

## Daniel 2:12 (id: 9956)

The king was furious because contradicting or refusing the king’s command was an offense punishable by death. The king was supposed to be treated as divine, so they were violating protocol in saying that he was not. The king’s sages were also supposed to have a connection with the divine, but they admitted that they did not. The offense to the king was so severe that he ordered that all the wise men of Babylon be executed. The king’s rage foreshadows [11:11–35](https://ref.ly/Dan11:11-Dan11:35).

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 2:12

## Daniel 2:16 (id: 9957)

The fact that Daniel could go at once to see the king shows his authority and influence. Daniel demonstrated his wisdom and excellent protocol at the royal court by using gentle words to turn away anger (cp. [Prov 15:1](https://ref.ly/Prov15:1)).

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 2:16

## Daniel 2:17–23 (id: 9958)

With faith and wisdom, Daniel prayed for God’s intervention (cp. [Phil 4:6](https://ref.ly/Phil4:6)). When God answered his prayer, Daniel praised God for giving him wisdom and knowledge ([Dan 2:20–21](https://ref.ly/Dan2:20-Dan2:21)). The God of heaven produced the dream and its meaning, demonstrating his supremacy over all other gods, including the gods of Babylon.

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 2:17–DAN 2:23

## Daniel 2:18 (id: 9959)

Daniel appealed to God’s mercy (see [Exod 34:6–7](https://ref.ly/Exod34:6-Exod34:7)). God was not obligated to answer Daniel’s prayer, but doing so would accord with his character.

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 2:18

## Daniel 2:20–23 (id: 9961)

Daniel acknowledged and praised Israel’s God (God of my ancestors, [2:23](https://ref.ly/Dan2:23)) as the source of the dream and its interpretation.

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 2:20–DAN 2:23

## Daniel 2:21 (id: 9962)

The dream revealed the Lord as the sovereign king of history (see [2:29–45](https://ref.ly/Dan2:29-Dan2:45)).

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 2:21

## Daniel 2:24 (id: 9963)

Daniel’s influence with Arioch indicates Daniel’s wisdom and stature in the royal service.

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 2:24

## Daniel 2:25 (id: 9964)

There were captives in Babylon from other nations besides Judah. • Daniel, one of Abraham’s offspring, brought the blessing of God’s revelation to the Babylonian king (see [Gen 12:3](https://ref.ly/Gen12:3)).

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 2:25

## Daniel 2:26 (id: 9965)

Is this true? Nebuchadnezzar was surprised that a non\-Babylonian could have this ability since the Babylonian religion and culture strongly emphasized their own wise men as “purveyors of the heavens.”

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 2:26

## Daniel 2:27–28 (id: 9966)

Daniel made it clear that no human could do what was required (cp.[2:10–11](https://ref.ly/Dan2:10-Dan2:11); see also [Gen 41:16](https://ref.ly/Gen41:16)).

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 2:27–DAN 2:28

## Daniel 2:28 (id: 9967)

a God in heaven: Daniel proclaimed one true God who rules all things ([2:20–21](https://ref.ly/Dan2:20-Dan2:21)), not a limited local deity such as the ones the Babylonians worshiped. The God of Daniel’s ancestors ([2:23](https://ref.ly/Dan2:23)) is the God in heaven who reveals secrets. The Babylonian gods could not do this. • what will happen: In the ancient world, dreams were often understood as revealing the future.

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 2:28

## Daniel 2:29–30 (id: 9968)

God had shown the king the long march of future history. Nebuchadnezzar was keenly interested in history, pursuing knowledge of the past and seeking to make a place for himself as history went forward. God wanted Nebuchadnezzar to understand the course of history, perhaps to impress upon him that Israel’s God, the God of heaven, is the God of all history.

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 2:29–DAN 2:30

## Daniel 2:31–33 (id: 9970)

The progression downward is one of value: from the most valuable, gold ([2:32](https://ref.ly/Dan2:32)), to the least valuable, iron and baked clay ([2:33](https://ref.ly/Dan2:33)).

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 2:31–DAN 2:33

## Daniel 2:32–33 (id: 9971)

There were gradations of gold; fine gold was the highest quality. • thighs: Above the knees. • legs: Below the knees.

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 2:32–DAN 2:33

## Daniel 2:34 (id: 9972)

The phrase from a mountain is implied (cp. [2:35](https://ref.ly/Dan2:35)) but is not in the Aramaic text.

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 2:34

## Daniel 2:35 (id: 9973)

covered (literally *filled*) the whole earth: Cp. [Gen 1:28](https://ref.ly/Gen1:28); [Exod 1:7](https://ref.ly/Exod1:7); [Matt 28:18–20](https://ref.ly/Matt28:18-Matt28:20). This new kingdom would replace all other kingdoms.

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 2:35

## Daniel 2:36–38 (id: 9974)

you are the greatest of kings (literally *king of kings*): Nebuchadnezzar had attained kingship over all other empires and their kings. He was the appointed ruler for that time in history ([Jer 25:8–9](https://ref.ly/Jer25:8-Jer25:9)).

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 2:36–DAN 2:38

## Daniel 2:39 (id: 9975)

inferior to yours: Silver was inferior in value to gold, as the chest is lower than the head. Nebuchadnezzar was an extremely stable ruler who held the Neo\-Babylonian Empire together. Persia, by contrast, was often threatened with internal divisions and instability around the periphery.

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 2:39

## Daniel 2:41–42 (id: 9977)

as weak as clay: Feet are crucial to stability; the feet were brittle and illustrate how precarious the whole image—that is, earthly kingdoms and their power—would be.

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 2:41–DAN 2:42

## Daniel 2:43 (id: 9978)

Just as iron and clay do not mix*, . . .* intermarriage among different people groups could weaken political alliances rather than produce real or lasting unity. This empire would be fragmented.

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 2:43

## Daniel 2:44 (id: 9979)

Those kings were probably kings that arose within the fourth kingdom and attempted to strengthen themselves by alliances of intermarriage. However, the phrase might refer to all the kings of the statue as God’s kingdom persistently breaks into the flow of history. • it will stand forever: Only a kingdom whose authority and power are from God (see [John 18:36](https://ref.ly/John18:36)) can never be destroyed*,* for all earthly kingdoms crumble.

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 2:44

## Daniel 2:45 (id: 9980)

The Babylonians often pictured the earth as a mountain (or ziggurat); hence, the rock would cover or replace the entire earth. • The dream is true: The dream, clearly explained by divine revelation, was truth from God. • its meaning is certain: God guaranteed that what the dream communicated would certainly take place.

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 2:45

## Daniel 2:46 (id: 9981)

The Aramaic word translated worshiped could also be translated “paid him homage or honor,” but not necessarily so. Nebuchadnezzar was a pagan; his religion had many gods, and he thought that the spirit of the gods was in Daniel ([4:8](https://ref.ly/Dan4:8); cp. [5:11](https://ref.ly/Dan5:11)). Regardless, he was recognizing that what Daniel had done was not the result of the ordinary human spirit (cp. [Gen 41:38](https://ref.ly/Gen41:38)).

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 2:46

## Daniel 2:47 (id: 9982)

greatest of gods . . . Lord over kings: Nebuchadnezzar repaid the compliment ([2:37–38](https://ref.ly/Dan2:37-Dan2:38)), acknowledging by his words and actions ([2:46](https://ref.ly/Dan2:46)) that God is supreme over all, even over Nebuchadnezzar himself.

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 2:47

## Daniel 2:48 (id: 9983)

Daniel was made ruler over Babylon as the king’s deputy (cp. [Gen 41:37–46](https://ref.ly/Gen41:37-Gen41:46)).

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 2:48

## Daniel 2:49 (id: 9984)

Daniel delegated the administration of the province to his three friends so that he could remain in the king’s court as his counselor.

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 2:49

## Daniel 3:1 (id: 9994)

The plain of Dura might be the plain adjacent to the city of Babylon, or the Aramaic term might refer to the magnificent outer wall of Babylon described by the Greek historian Herodotus. • statue: Literally *image.*

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 3:1

## Daniel 3:1–30 (id: 9987)

Nebuchadnezzar’s megalomania, perhaps encouraged by the vision of ch [2](https://ref.ly/Dan2:1-Dan2:49), inspired him to construct a gilded statue and demand that everyone in his empire worship it. He had not learned the lesson that God cannot be captured in any created thing. The three young Hebrews refused to worship it as a god. They were faithful to the Lord, and the Lord rescued them from the king’s wrath.

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 3:1–DAN 3:30

## Daniel 3:2 (id: 9999)

The various classes of people listed here were all governmental officials.

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 3:2

## Daniel 3:5 (id: 10001)

Pipes could be rendered “drums,” or possibly this was a word of musical direction that indicated being “in harmony” with the other instruments.

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 3:5

## Daniel 3:7 (id: 10002)

all the people: Outside of Israel, idol worship was normal, so all the non\-Jewish people obeyed the king’s command.

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 3:7

## Daniel 3:11 (id: 9988)

In some situations, the Lord’s people must refuse to obey the established authorities in order to remain faithful to the Lord (cp. [Acts 4:19](https://ref.ly/Acts4:19); [5:29](https://ref.ly/Acts5:29); [Rom 13:1–7](https://ref.ly/Rom13:1-Rom13:7)).

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 3:11

## Daniel 3:12 (id: 9989)

These Jews had defied his Majesty the king, specifically by refusing to worship his statue. Defying the king was an act of high treason (cp. [2:10–13](https://ref.ly/Dan2:10-Dan2:13)).

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 3:12

## Daniel 3:13 (id: 9990)

Nebuchadnezzar was capable of deadly rage against even his most honored officials (cp. [2:12](https://ref.ly/Dan2:12), [48–49](https://ref.ly/Dan2:48-Dan2:49)).

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 3:13

## Daniel 3:14 (id: 9991)

Is it true … ? The Aramaic word is used only here in the Old Testament. The king may have been asking, “Are your actions deliberate?”

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 3:14

## Daniel 3:15 (id: 9992)

I will give you one more chance: The three men’s earlier relationship to the king may have helped them get a second chance.

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 3:15

## Daniel 3:16–18 (id: 9993)

The three men declared their faithfulness to God above all. They were entrusting themselves to the God who had rescued the entire nation of Israel from the power of Pharaoh ([Exod 18:10](https://ref.ly/Exod18:10)). God later revealed that those who remain faithful unto death will be delivered even after they have died ([Dan 12:1–3](https://ref.ly/Dan12:1-Dan12:3)).

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 3:16–DAN 3:18

In his pride, King Nebuchadnezzar convinced himself that he had built Babylon ([4:30](https://ref.ly/Dan4:30); cp. [Gen 11:1–9](https://ref.ly/Gen11:1-Gen11:9)). He disregarded the warning of the Most High God ([Dan 4:24–27](https://ref.ly/Dan4:24-Dan4:27)). He had still not learned the lesson God was teaching him through these experiences, that the God of Daniel stands outside the world of time and space, and no human is equal to him. So God’s decree of judgment fell upon Nebuchadnezzar ([4:17](https://ref.ly/Dan4:17), [25–26](https://ref.ly/Dan4:25-Dan4:26); see [Prov 16:18](https://ref.ly/Prov16:18)).

In Egypt, Pharaoh had asserted the same thing of Joseph ([Gen 41:37–38](https://ref.ly/Gen41:37-Gen41:38)). It was the Most High God who assisted Daniel ([Dan 4:24](https://ref.ly/Dan4:24)).

Stop sinning and do what is right: Righteousness and justice exalt a nation and extend the reign of a king; the lack of it dooms a people.

A former great king of Babylon, Hammurabi (about 1792–1750 BC), claimed to have been charged by his god Marduk to shepherd and protect the orphaned, the widowed, and the oppressed. • Perhaps then: Daniel recognized that God was free to act or not act (cp. [Dan 3:16–18](https://ref.ly/Dan3:16-Dan3:18)); because he is a merciful God, he might take pity on the condemned king (cp.

Earthly kingdoms all pass away. As Nebuchadnezzar’s dream implied, Babylon would pass away and a new sovereign kingdom would take its place ([2:39](https://ref.ly/Dan2:39)). After Nebuchadnezzar’s death in 562 BC, violence and debauchery increased in the palaces of Babylon until, during Belshazzar’s feast in 539 BC, even God’s holy vessels were polluted and defiled. God’s judgment came with lightning swiftness that night ([5:30](https://ref.ly/Dan5:30)), and the next kingdom took over (see [2:32](https://ref.ly/Dan2:32),[39](https://ref.ly/Dan2:39); [5:31](https://ref.ly/Dan5:31)).

Darius the Mede is distinct from later Persian kings named Darius (see “The Medes and Persians” Profile). Cyrus the Great conquered Babylon in 539 BC, and there is no mention of a Darius the Mede in other sources. Two solutions are possible: 

1. Cyrus the Great might have chosen Darius the Mede to rule as “King of Babylon” in his place for a little over a year (compare [Dan 6:28](https://ref.ly/Dan6:28); [9:1](https://ref.ly/Dan9:1); [11:1](https://ref.ly/Dan11:1)).
2. Darius and Cyrus might have been the same man bearing two throne names—one name from the Medes, the other from the Persians (see also study note on 6:28).

The portrayal of Darius in ch [6](https://ref.ly/Dan6:1-Dan6:28) suggests that he was in fact Cyrus, the ruler of all Media, Persia, and Babylonia.

## Daniel 7:1–12.13 (id: 10062)

The second half of the book features visions given to Daniel. These visions showed Daniel and his people, both those in exile and those who had returned to Judea, that the future is securely in God’s hands. All empires will ultimately fall before the Kingdom of Heaven. Daniel’s people will be rescued from all their troubles ([12:1–3](https://ref.ly/Dan12:1-Dan12:3)), and God will resurrect and judge all humankind (see [12:13](https://ref.ly/Dan12:13)). Daniel interpreted these visions with help from divine messengers ([7:10](https://ref.ly/Dan7:10); [8:15](https://ref.ly/Dan8:15); [9:22](https://ref.ly/Dan9:22); [10:14](https://ref.ly/Dan10:14); [12:7](https://ref.ly/Dan12:7)).

The lion and eagle are dignified rulers in their realms. Lions featured prominently in ancient art and architecture. Nebuchadnezzar and Babylon are represented as a lion and an eagle attacking Edom ([Jer 49:19](https://ref.ly/Jer49:19), [22](https://ref.ly/Jer49:22)). • This beast became like a human being and was given a human mind: Nebuchadnezzar had taken on the mind of a beast ([Dan 4:16](https://ref.ly/Dan4:16), [32–33](https://ref.ly/Dan4:32-Dan4:33)), but then he was restored and learned to acknowledge the Most High God ([4:34–37](https://ref.ly/Dan4:34-Dan4:37)).

The leopard was known for its speed and agility ([Hab 1:8](https://ref.ly/Hab1:8)). Four bird’s wings and four heads indicate the scope and speed of this fierce nation’s military campaigns.

The fourth beast was different in kind, not just degree. It was made of nonliving metal.

He bore the name “Epiphanes” (“The Manifest Presence \[of God]”), but many, including Jews, mockingly called him “Epimanes” (“Mad Man”). By desecrating the Temple and Jewish worship ([8:11–12](https://ref.ly/Dan8:11-Dan8:12)), Antiochus tried to destroy Judaism and unify his kingdom under the cult of Hellenistic culture.

God’s unfailing love (Hebrew khesed, elsewhere translated “grace,” “mercy,” “kindness”) is his fundamental nature that is the cause of faith, hope, and worship throughout the Bible (see [Num 14:18](https://ref.ly/Num14:18); [Neh 9:17](https://ref.ly/Neh9:17); [Pss 108:4](https://ref.ly/Ps108:4); [136:1–26](https://ref.ly/Ps136:1-Ps136:26); [Jon 2:4](https://ref.ly/Jonah2:4); [1 Jn 4:7–8](https://ref.ly/1John4:7-1John4:8)).

God’s faithfulness contrasted sharply with his people’s unfaithfulness and rebellion. When Daniel confessed the sins of his people, he included himself among them ([9:5](https://ref.ly/Dan9:5)), though he had lived a laudatory life (see “Community Identity” Theme Note). Daniel prayed the equivalent of a high priestly prayer on behalf of his people, using many quotations from and allusions to the Torah, prophets, and psalms.

## Daniel 9:24 (id: 10122)

Many understand the period of seventy sets of seven as seventy “weeks of years”—i.e., 490 years. However, they are not called “years” in the Hebrew text, and it has proven difficult to assign this period to an actual historical period of 490 years. Therefore, many interpreters believe that the numbers are not intended as calendar years but as symbolic periods of time to fulfill the visions. Just as Jerusalem suffered a lifetime of desolation ([9:2](https://ref.ly/Dan9:2); see study note on Jer 25:11), the city would experience many lifetimes of restoration. • The period of time was for your people (the Jews) and your holy city (Jerusalem). The six purposes listed here appear to refer to the restoration of the Jews and the city of Jerusalem. Other interpreters see these six purposes as representing God’s universal work of redemption in the world. • God would finish the rebellion of the Israelites, and he would also finish the rebellions of human rulers who defy the Lord and attack the holy people ([Dan 7:8](https://ref.ly/Dan7:8), [22](https://ref.ly/Dan7:22), [25–26](https://ref.ly/Dan7:25-Dan7:26); [8:13–14](https://ref.ly/Dan8:13-Dan8:14); [11:29–45](https://ref.ly/Dan11:29-Dan11:45)). • To confirm the prophetic vision means to fulfill the content of the visionary answer to Daniel’s prayer. • the Most Holy Place (Or *the Most Holy One;* literally *a most holy*): Some interpreters see this as referring to the restored Most Holy Place in the Temple in 164 BC. Others see it as referring to the anointing of Christ and his church as God’s own temple ([Matt 12:6](https://ref.ly/Matt12:6); [Eph 2:19–22](https://ref.ly/Eph2:19-Eph2:22)).

Gabriel further explained the meaning of Daniel’s vision ([9:22–23](https://ref.ly/Dan9:22-Dan9:23)). Because the vision of ch [8](https://ref.ly/Dan8:1-Dan8:27) culminated with Antiochus IV (see [8:23–25](https://ref.ly/Dan8:23-Dan8:25); cp. [11:21–39](https://ref.ly/Dan11:21-Dan11:39)), many interpreters understand this explanation as also pointing to Antiochus. Others understand it as culminating in the death of Christ, followed by the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70 and the coming of the antichrist.

## Daniel 9:25 (id: 10123)

The command . . . to rebuild Jerusalem and its Temple marks the beginning of the seventy sets of seven. The event that best fits this description is the decree of Cyrus the Great in 538 BC that allowed the Jews to return to Jerusalem and begin rebuilding (see [5:31](https://ref.ly/Dan5:31); [9:1](https://ref.ly/Dan9:1); [Ezra 1:2–4](https://ref.ly/Ezra1:2-Ezra1:4)). Less likely are the decrees of Artaxerxes I in 458 BC (see [Ezra 7:12–26](https://ref.ly/Ezra7:12-Ezra7:26)) and 445 BC (see [Neh 2:5–8](https://ref.ly/Neh2:5-Neh2:8)). • a ruler—the Anointed One: Many interpreters see Christ as fulfilling this prophecy, so they understand this passage as describing history from the time of Daniel to the time of Christ. However, an “anointed one” can refer to any of Israel’s kings or priests, who were ordained by anointing with oil. If the passage was fulfilled in the time of Antiochus IV, then the anointed one was probably the high priest at the time, Onias III (cp. [Dan 11:22](https://ref.ly/Dan11:22)). • and strong defenses: The vision refers to Jerusalem as being physically rebuilt. The rebuilding of the Temple was completed in 515 BC ([Ezra 3:1–6:22](https://ref.ly/Ezra3:1-Ezra6:22)); in 445 BC, Nehemiah completed the wall of Jerusalem ([Neh 2–6](https://ref.ly/Neh2:1-Neh6:19)). • The perilous times can refer to the history of Jerusalem and its Temple from the time the decree was published until the end of the seventy sets of seven (see [Dan 11:2–45](https://ref.ly/Dan11:2-Dan11:45)).

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 9:25

## Daniel 9:26 (id: 10124)

the Anointed One (literally *an anointed*): Those who see the fulfillment of this passage in the time of Antiochus IV point to the murder of the high priest Onias III in 171 BC as the fulfillment of this prophecy (see study note on 11:22). Those who see the fulfillment of this passage in the time of Christ will refer this prophecy to the crucifixion of the Messiah in AD 30 or 33\. • The ruler who will arise could refer to Antiochus IV, who attempted to destroy the Jewish people and their worship in the Temple between 171 and 164 BC (see *1 Maccabees* 1:20–40\). Many believe, however, that the destruction of the city and the Temple refers to the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans in AD 66–70\. • The end refers to the completion of the seventy sets of seven. The text implies that the very end is a later time, and that the war would continue into the future (cp. [Matt 24:4–8](https://ref.ly/Matt24:4-Matt24:8); [Mark 13:5–8](https://ref.ly/Mark13:5-Mark13:8)). • The image of a flood often represents an invading army (cp. [Dan 11:10](https://ref.ly/Dan11:10), [22](https://ref.ly/Dan11:22), [40](https://ref.ly/Dan11:40); [Nah 1:8](https://ref.ly/Nah1:8)) or devastating destruction.

## Daniel 9:27 (id: 10125)

The ruler (literally *he*): Most interpreters understand this pronoun as referring to the ruler of [9:26](https://ref.ly/Dan9:26). Some think that it refers back to the anointed one of [9:25–26](https://ref.ly/Dan9:25-Dan9:26) and is thus a prophecy about Christ, meaning that Christ caused a covenant to prevail and removed the need for sacrifices and offerings by his death. However, the word behind make a treaty has the sense of imposing a covenant, evidently by the use of force or intimidation. Antiochus IV imposed a covenant with the people of Judea following the beginning of his rule in 175 BC (cp. [11:23](https://ref.ly/Dan11:23); see *1 Maccabees* 1:10–15\). Other interpreters believe that this prophecy was fulfilled in the events of AD 66–70\. For still others, it refers to a future ruler. • The phrase put an end refers to a destructive action, not an act of God’s salvation such as the Messiah would accomplish by his death. In 167 BC, Antiochus IV ordered the people of Judea to cease all practice of Jewish worship in the Temple and instead practice pagan worship, on pain of death (see *1 Maccabees* 1:41–63\). Similarly, the Roman general Titus put an end to the sacrifices and offerings in the Temple when he destroyed it in AD 70\. • a sacrilegious object that causes desecration (literally *an abomination of desolation*): Cp. [Dan 8:13](https://ref.ly/Dan8:13); [11:31](https://ref.ly/Dan11:31); [12:11](https://ref.ly/Dan12:11). This expression (Hebrew shiqqutsim meshomem) is possibly a mocking play on the Semitic name for Zeus (*Ba‘al Shamayim*, “Lord of the Heavens”). Idol\-gods are often referred to as *shiqquts,* “abomination,” “desolation,” elsewhere in the Bible (see [Deut 29:17](https://ref.ly/Deut29:17); [2 Chr 15:8](https://ref.ly/2Chr15:8); [Isa 66:3](https://ref.ly/Isa66:3); [Jer 32:34](https://ref.ly/Jer32:34); [Ezek 20:7](https://ref.ly/Ezek20:7)), and the similarity between the sounds of *shomem*, “devastation, destruction, desolation,” and *shamayim* is clear. In December 167 BC, Antiochus IV erected an image of Zeus atop the altar of burnt offering in the Temple court and sacrificed unclean animals there. The same phrase (*abomination of desolation*) is used in *1 Maccabees* 1:54 to describe that altar and its sacrifices. Jesus and multiple New Testament authors anticipated a desolating sacrilege in the future ([Matt 24:15](https://ref.ly/Matt24:15); [Mark 13:14](https://ref.ly/Mark13:14); [Luke 21:20](https://ref.ly/Luke21:20); [2 Thes 2:3–4](https://ref.ly/2Thess2:3-2Thess2:4)). After Titus destroyed the Temple in Jerusalem in AD 70, the Romans set up their idols in the Temple precinct and made sacrifices to their gods (see Josephus, *War* 6\.6\.1\). The apostle John later observed that many antichrists had appeared ([1 Jn 2:18–23](https://ref.ly/1John2:18-1John2:23)) and that the spirit of the antichrist was at work in the world ([1 Jn 4:3](https://ref.ly/1John4:3)). • The time of destruction is under God’s control, and the fate decreed for this defiler is certain to come (cp. [Dan 7:11](https://ref.ly/Dan7:11); [8:25](https://ref.ly/Dan8:25); [11:45](https://ref.ly/Dan11:45)). So it is with every ruler who exalts himself against God and seeks to destroy God’s people.

Behind all of this, the Ancient One sovereignly guides all things and sits in judgment upon the process and its conclusion. God’s covenant with his people, and their relationship with him through prayer, are central to this process—the world is not ultimately governed by angels and spirit princes, but by the Ancient One, who hears the prayers of his people.

Throughout this passage, the king of the south describes Alexander’s general Ptolemy and his descendants, who ruled Egypt; the king of the north describes Alexander’s general Seleucus and his descendants, who ruled Syria and Mesopotamia. In the period following Alexander’s death, the kings of Egypt and Syria vied for control of the strategically located land of Palestine. The holy city and the holy people lay between these two powers. These battles continued until their appointed end ([11:27](https://ref.ly/Dan11:27), [35](https://ref.ly/Dan11:35), [40](https://ref.ly/Dan11:40), [45](https://ref.ly/Dan11:45); [12:1](https://ref.ly/Dan12:1), [7](https://ref.ly/Dan12:7)).

Antiochus IV invaded the south \[Egypt] . . . once again (see Polybius, *Histories* 29\.1\). • The warships from western coastlands refers to the Romans. The Roman general Popilius Laenas drew a circle in the sand, forced Antiochus to stand inside it, and made him decide whether to return home or prepare for war with Rome before exiting the circle. Fearing the Roman fleet, Antiochus chose to withdraw and return home. He then vented his anger and humiliation against the Jews, the people of the holy covenant. He took Jerusalem in 167 BC and rewarded those who would come over to him. He polluted the altar (see [Dan 8:9–14](https://ref.ly/Dan8:9-Dan8:14), [23–26](https://ref.ly/Dan8:23-Dan8:26)), stopped the sacrifices, set up a statue of the Greek god Zeus in the Temple, and harassed and killed whoever refused to forsake the covenant (see *1 Maccabees* 1:62–64; cp.

A little help came when the family of Mattathias and those around them, who were called Maccabees, instigated a national revolt which Antiochus, occupied elsewhere, could not put down. In 164 BC, three years after the Temple had been desecrated, the Maccabees recaptured Jerusalem, removed the sacrilegious object (the statue of Zeus), cleansed the altar, and restored the daily sacrifices ([8:11–14](https://ref.ly/Dan8:11-Dan8:14), [26](https://ref.ly/Dan8:26); *1 Maccabees* 1:59\).
