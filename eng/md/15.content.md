## Ezra 1:1 (id: 11935)

* King Cyrus II ruled Persia from 559 to 530 BC. In October 539 BC, Cyrus and his Persian forces conquered Babylon, as Daniel had predicted ([Daniel 5](https://ref.ly/Dan5:1-Dan5:31)).
* *the word...through Jeremiah*: God promised to bring his people back after seventy years in exile ([Jeremiah 25:11–12](https://ref.ly/Jer25:11-Jer25:12); [29:10](https://ref.ly/Jer29:10)).
* God's influence over this non\-believing king led him to issue the following decree (see also [Isaiah 13:17](https://ref.ly/Isa13:17); [41:2](https://ref.ly/Isa41:2), [25](https://ref.ly/Isa41:25); [Jeremiah 50:9](https://ref.ly/Jer50:9)). God remains in control, even when rulers and nations do not acknowledge his authority ([Isaiah 10:5](https://ref.ly/Isa10:5), [12–14](https://ref.ly/Isa10:12-Isa10:14)).

## Ezra 1:1–3 (id: 11934)

The first three verses of Ezra are nearly identical to [2 Chronicles 36:22–23](https://ref.ly/2Chr36:22-2Chr36:23). This suggests a connection between the books.

## Ezra 1:2 (id: 11936)

Although Cyrus mentions the Lord, the God of heaven, he was actually a Zoroastrian. His proclamation, written in Hebrew, was likely political propaganda to gain Jewish support for his rule. In a similar statement to the Babylonians, Cyrus claimed to worship their chief god, Marduk. However, his words here show that God appointed him to build a temple in Jerusalem (see [Isaiah 44:28](https://ref.ly/Isa44:28); [45:1](https://ref.ly/Isa45:1), [13](https://ref.ly/Isa45:13)). He might have learned about these prophecies from Daniel, who served in his court as a high government official (Cyrus is likely referred to by his Median name, Darius, in [Daniel 6:1–28](https://ref.ly/Dan6:1-Dan6:28); [9:1](https://ref.ly/Dan9:1)). God had long planned to raise up Cyrus and give him a vision to restore worship in Jerusalem ([Isaiah 44:28](https://ref.ly/Isa44:28); [45:13](https://ref.ly/Isa45:13); [48:14–15](https://ref.ly/Isa48:14-Isa48:15)).

## Ezra 1:3 (id: 11937)

*Whoever among you belongs to His people...may he go*: The Assyrians and Babylonians controlled their empires by moving people and spreading them across cities. In contrast, the Persians sent exiled people back to their homelands. They expected these people to be grateful, obey the Persians, and pay taxes.

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 1:3

## Ezra 1:4 (id: 11938)

Cyrus likely did not urge Babylonian neighbors to help the Jewish remnant. Instead, he encouraged Jews staying in Babylon to assist their countrymen returning to Jerusalem.

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 1:4
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Ezra 1:5–6 (id: 11939)

* As with Cyrus's heart ([Ezra 1:1](https://ref.ly/Ezra1:1)), God inspired Israel’s leaders.
* Few priests and Levites responded (see [Ezra 2:36–42](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:36-Ezra2:42)). Most responders were from the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. Persian documents show many Jews stayed in Babylon, where they had homes, businesses, and relatives. A dangerous four\-month journey back to Jerusalem, now a desolate city inhabited by foreigners, was not appealing compared to their comfortable life in Babylon. It was easier to give valuable gifts and voluntary offerings to those who returned.

## Ezra 1:7 (id: 11940)

Many items from the Lord’s temple had been taken to Babylon (see [2 Chronicles 36:7](https://ref.ly/2Chr36:7); [Daniel 1:2](https://ref.ly/Dan1:2)). By placing these items in his pagan temple, Nebuchadnezzar tried to show his god’s power over the Hebrew God. However, God promised the return of all the stolen items (see [Jeremiah 27:16–22](https://ref.ly/Jer27:16-Jer27:22)). The items from the temple were holy utensils, acceptable to God for worship and very valuable to the returning worshipers.

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 1:7
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Ezra 1:8 (id: 11941)

Sheshbazzar was the Persian\-appointed governor of Judah who laid the temple's foundation ([Ezra 5:14–16](https://ref.ly/Ezra5:14-Ezra5:16)). Some believe Zerubbabel ([Ezra 3:2](https://ref.ly/Ezra3:2), [8](https://ref.ly/Ezra3:8)) was the same person with a new name (see [Daniel 1:7](https://ref.ly/Dan1:7)). However, since both names are Babylonian, it is more likely these two leaders worked together on the temple foundation. Zerubbabel probably became governor after Sheshbazzar died.

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 1:8
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Ezra 1:9–11 (id: 11942)

*5,400 gold and silver articles*: The numbers listed only total 2,499 items. A similar account in the apocryphal book *1 Esdras* 2:13–15 lists 5,469 items, while a list by the Jewish historian Josephus in *Antiquities* 11\.15 lists 5,220 objects. Ezra’s shorter list shows the types of items included but does not list every item. Keeping track of consecrated utensils helped prevent confusion with pagan utensils used for worshiping other gods.

## Ezra 2:1–70 (id: 11952)

This chapter is Ezra's first major digression from the main story. The returning exiles needed to identify true Jews to maintain their community identity and theological purity. This helped them know whom they could marry and who could worship at the temple. This list is not the initial list of all Jews who returned to Jerusalem (compare [Nehemiah 7:6–73](https://ref.ly/Neh7:6-Neh7:73)). Instead, it is a slightly later list, created after Sheshbazzar died, of people who had settled in their towns.

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 2:1–EZR 2:70

## Ezra 2:2 (id: 11954)

Jeshua, a variant spelling of *Joshua*, son of Jehozadak ([Ezra 3:2](https://ref.ly/Ezra3:2), [8](https://ref.ly/Ezra3:8)), from Aaron's lineage, was the high priest ([Haggai 1:1](https://ref.ly/Hag1:1); [Zechariah 3:1](https://ref.ly/Zech3:1)). The Nehemiah mentioned here is not the one who later built Jerusalem's walls. This Mordecai is not the famous relative of Esther.

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 2:2
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Ezra 2:3–20 (id: 11955)

In the ancient Near East, people identified themselves by answering, “Who are your father and your family?” Priests were known as the sons of Aaron. If they could not prove this link, they could not serve ([Ezra 2:61–62](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:61-Ezra2:62)). Others identified themselves by a well\-known elder in their group.

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 2:3–EZR 2:20
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Ezra 2:21–35 (id: 11953)

*the men of...the descendants of*: Some returnees were identified by their hometowns. Not everyone knew their family history or had famous ancestors. Most cities mentioned were near Jerusalem.

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 2:21–EZR 2:35
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Ezra 2:36–42 (id: 11956)

*the priests...The Levites*: Only seventy\-four Levites returned to Jerusalem, which was a very low number. Ezra later worked hard to bring thirty\-eight more with him (see study note on Ezra 8:18).

## Ezra 2:41–42 (id: 11957)

* The singers played instruments and sang for worship at the temple ([1 Chronicles 25:1–31](https://ref.ly/1Chr25:1-1Chr25:31); [Psalms 73–83](https://ref.ly/Ps73:1-Ps83:18)). The gatekeepers managed the temple gates and storehouses ([1 Chronicles 9:26–27](https://ref.ly/1Chr9:26-1Chr9:27); [2 Chronicles 23:19](https://ref.ly/2Chr23:19); [Nehemiah 12:25](https://ref.ly/Neh12:25)).
* Asaph was one of the three Levites King David appointed to lead music at the temple ([1 Chronicles 16:5](https://ref.ly/1Chr16:5), [7](https://ref.ly/1Chr16:7)). He wrote a collection of psalms ([Psalms 50](https://ref.ly/Ps50:1-Ps50:23), [73–83](https://ref.ly/Ps73:1-Ps83:18)). His family continued his work ([1 Chronicles 25:1–7](https://ref.ly/1Chr25:1-1Chr25:7)).

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 2:41–EZR 2:42
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Ezra 2:43–54 (id: 11958)

The temple servants were likely descendants of the Gibeonites ([Joshua 9:23–27](https://ref.ly/Josh9:23-Josh9:27)). They helped the Levites ([Ezra 8:20](https://ref.ly/Ezra8:20)) by carrying water and wood and sweeping floors.

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 2:43–EZR 2:54

## Ezra 2:55–58 (id: 11959)

The descendants of King Solomon's servants are linked to the temple servants ([Ezra 2:43–54](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:43-Ezra2:54)). Their names might show their duties. For example: 

* *Hassophereth*, meaning "the scribe," probably kept inventories
* *Pokereth\-hazzebaim*, meaning "gazelle\-hunter," likely hunted game

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 2:55–EZR 2:58
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Ezra 2:59–60 (id: 11960)

Some returnees believed in Israel's God but lacked genealogical records to prove they were Israelites. Without this information, the other Israelites were unsure whether to treat them as family and intermarry with them or as outsiders. The genealogies in [1 Chronicles 1–9](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:1-1Chr9:44) show how carefully many families kept their histories.

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 2:59–EZR 2:60
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Ezra 2:61–63 (id: 11961)

*they could not find them*: The lack of a genealogy was a problem for three families ([Ezra 2:61–62](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:61-Ezra2:62)). They were excluded from priestly privileges or responsibilities until the high priest received divine guidance through the Urim and Thummim to know God's will (see [Exodus 28:30](https://ref.ly/Exod28:30); [Numbers 27:21](https://ref.ly/Num27:21)). Although using the *Urim and Thummim* was like throwing dice or drawing straws, when done by the priest, the result was a divine decision, not random chance.

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 2:61–EZR 2:63
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Ezra 2:64–66 (id: 11962)

* *42,360*: This number might include children, as it does not match the 28,774 people listed in [Ezra 2:3–42](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:3-Ezra2:42).
* The large number of servants and animals indicates that some of the Jews who returned were wealthy.

When the tabernacle was built ([Exodus 25:2–7](https://ref.ly/Exod25:2-Exod25:7); [35:4–9](https://ref.ly/Exod35:4-Exod35:9)) and the temple was renovated ([2 Kings 12:1–21](https://ref.ly/2Kgs12:1-2Kgs12:21)), the people gave voluntary offerings to support the work. These funds added to the provincial grant by Darius ([Ezra 6:8](https://ref.ly/Ezra6:8)) and gifts from Israelites who remained in Babylon ([1:6](https://ref.ly/Ezra1:6)). Each person gave according to his resources.

* Each gold coin, known as a Hebrew daric, was worth a month's wages for a professional soldier.
* *5,000 minas of silver*: Each mina weighed 20 ounces and equaled 60 shekels of silver. Each shekel was worth an average worker's monthly wages.

Festivals in early autumn (literally *in the seventh month*) included the Festival of Trumpets (see [Leviticus 23:23–25](https://ref.ly/Lev23:23-Lev23:25)), the Day of Atonement (see [Leviticus 16](https://ref.ly/Lev16:1-Lev16:34)), and the Festival of Shelters (see [Leviticus 23:34–36](https://ref.ly/Lev23:34-Lev23:36)).

## Ezra 3:1–4.5 (id: 11965)

After resettling in various towns in Judah, the community focused on restoring the worship of God in Jerusalem. They quickly rebuilt the altar and began regular sacrifices in time to celebrate the Jewish festivals ([Ezra 3:4](https://ref.ly/Ezra3:4)). Then, they started the more challenging task of rebuilding the temple itself ([Ezra 3:8](https://ref.ly/Ezra3:8)). Soon, they faced opposition from local foreigners ([Ezra 4:1–5](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:1-Ezra4:5)).

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 3:1–EZR 4:5
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Ezra 3:2 (id: 11969)

* Jeshua ([Haggai 1:1](https://ref.ly/Hag1:1); [Zechariah 3:1](https://ref.ly/Zech3:1)) was the high priest ([Nehemiah 12:1](https://ref.ly/Neh12:1)). However, Ezra did not use this title ([Ezra 2:2](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:2); [3:2](https://ref.ly/Ezra3:2); [4:3](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:3); [5:2](https://ref.ly/Ezra5:2)), which suggests the title was given after the temple was completed ([6:15](https://ref.ly/Ezra6:15)).
* Zerubbabel served as the governor of Judah, appointed by Persia ([Haggai 1:1](https://ref.ly/Hag1:1)), likely after Sheshbazzar died (see study note on Ezra 1:8). He was the grandson of King Jehoiachin of Judah ([1 Chronicles 3:17](https://ref.ly/1Chr3:17)).

## Ezra 3:3 (id: 11970)

* The local residents were foreigners resettled from abroad by the Assyrian king Esarhaddon, who ruled from 680 to 669 BC after the people of the northern kingdom of Israel were exiled in 722 BC ([2 Kings 17:24–40](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:24-2Kgs17:40)). Some had moved into the Jerusalem area during Judah’s seventy\-year exile. A pagan altar might have been built on the site, and it needed removal before constructing the new one dedicated to the Lord.
* *on its foundations*: It was important to place the altar at the exact sacred spot where Solomon’s altar had been to connect with the authentic worship carried on before the exile in Babylon.
* Daily morning and evening sacrifices (see [Exodus 29:38–42](https://ref.ly/Exod29:38-Exod29:42); [Numbers 28:3–8](https://ref.ly/Num28:3-Num28:8)) dedicated the day to God.

The seven\-day Festival of Shelters, as described in the Law ([Leviticus 23:33–36](https://ref.ly/Lev23:33-Lev23:36); [Numbers 29:12–38](https://ref.ly/Num29:12-Num29:38); [Deuteronomy 16:13–16](https://ref.ly/Deut16:13-Deut16:16)), reminded people of God's guidance and care during the forty years the nation lived in tents while traveling from Egypt to the promised land. This festival was especially meaningful to those who had recently made a similar journey from a foreign land, living in tents as they traveled to the promised land.

* **Associated Articles:** 

## Ezra 3:5–6 (id: 11972)

* The list of sacrifices, offered even before the temple's foundation was laid, showed the people's eagerness to worship God faithfully at every chance. They followed the law's instructions precisely.
* The new moon celebrations occurred on the first day of each Hebrew month. The sacrifices and trumpet blasts reminded the people of God's covenant with them ([Numbers 10:10](https://ref.ly/Num10:10); [28:11–15](https://ref.ly/Num28:11-Num28:15)).
* Voluntary offerings included gifts like money for building the temple ([Exodus 35:29](https://ref.ly/Exod35:29); [36:3](https://ref.ly/Exod36:3)). The Hebrew term can also refer to peace offerings of meat or bread, eaten to celebrate fellowship with God ([Leviticus 7:11–21](https://ref.ly/Lev7:11-Lev7:21)).

*Sidon and Tyre*: Few tall and straight trees grew in the dry climate of Judah. Those that had grown in Israel were already cut down. Therefore, they hired skilled laborers from countries with tall trees (see also [1 Chronicles 22:1–5](https://ref.ly/1Chr22:1-1Chr22:5); [2 Chronicles 2:7–16](https://ref.ly/2Chr2:7-2Chr2:16)).

* The music at this dedication ceremony was similar to the singing when Solomon first brought the ark into the temple ([2 Chronicles 5:12–13](https://ref.ly/2Chr5:12-2Chr5:13)). Both events led the worshipers to give praise and thanks to the Lord for his faithful covenant love and goodness.

King Esarhaddon of Assyria, who ruled from 680 to 669 BC, deported the people of Israel to foreign lands. He relocated other conquered peoples to Israel during King Manasseh's reign in Judah. These foreigners learned about the Lord when they arrived in Israel, but they also continued to worship their old gods ([2 Kings 17:27–34](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:27-2Kgs17:34), [40–41](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:40-2Kgs17:41)).

* The people faced severe consequences for their strict dedication to holiness.
* King Cyrus ruled until 530 BC. Darius (Darius I) became the king of Persia in 521 BC. Construction on the temple restarted in 520 BC and concluded in 515 BC (see [Ezra 6:15](https://ref.ly/Ezra6:15)).

These verses discuss later opposition to Jewish rebuilding efforts. They actually relate to events during the reign of: 

* Xerxes in 486 to 465 BC
* Artaxerxes I in 465 to 424 BC

However, they are included here because they match the theme of opposition. Chronologically, [Ezra 4:6](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:6) fits between chapters [6](https://ref.ly/Ezra6:1-Ezra6:22) and [7](https://ref.ly/Ezra7:1-Ezra7:28), while [4:7–23](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:7-Ezra4:23) fits before [Nehemiah 1](https://ref.ly/Neh1:1-Neh1:11).

* The exact date of these events is unknown. They might have happened around the same time as an Egyptian revolt in 448 BC. This was a few years before Artaxerxes I sent Nehemiah to Jerusalem in 445 BC. If this is true, the enemies of Judah and Artaxerxes likely believed the Jews would revolt like the Egyptians did.

A tribute was a yearly set tax. Customs were likely sales taxes, and tolls were probably fees for using roads. Earlier rulers had gathered significant revenue from the region ([Ezra 4:20](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:20); compare [1 Kings 10:14–15](https://ref.ly/1Kgs10:14-1Kgs10:15)).

* The title *the great God* was a Persian way to refer to an important high deity. It does not mean the provincial authorities believed in Israel’s God.
* Following the design of Solomon’s temple ([1 Kings 6:36](https://ref.ly/1Kgs6:36)), builders placed a layer of timber in the walls after every three rows of prepared stones (see [Ezra 6:4](https://ref.ly/Ezra6:4)). This helped reduce potential earthquake damage.

* *a sin offering for all Israel of twelve male goats*: This blood sacrifice brought God's forgiveness for unintentional sins, ceremonial uncleanness, or thoughtless wrong acts ([Leviticus 4–5](https://ref.ly/Lev4:1-Lev5:19)). Similar sacrifices were made when Moses dedicated the tabernacle ([Numbers 7](https://ref.ly/Num7:1-Num7:89)) and when Solomon dedicated the first temple ([2 Chronicles 7:1](https://ref.ly/2Chr7:1), [4](https://ref.ly/2Chr7:4)).
* *one for each tribe of Israel*: Although most returnees were from Judah and Benjamin ([Ezra 1:5](https://ref.ly/Ezra1:5); [4:1](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:1)), people from the priestly tribe of Levi are also mentioned ([1:5](https://ref.ly/Ezra1:5); [2:40](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:40), [70](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:70)). It is also likely that there were returnees from some of the ten northern tribes of Israel. Even if all tribes were not physically represented, the twelve sacrifices emphasized the desire for God to maintain his covenant relationship with all Israel.

* *son*: In biblical genealogies, the Hebrew word translated as *son* often means *descendant.*
* Seraiah was the high priest under Zedekiah; Nebuchadnezzar executed him in 586 BC ([2 Kings 25:18–21](https://ref.ly/2Kgs25:18-2Kgs25:21)).

Ezra emphasizes his status by tracing his genealogy through Zadok, a priest under Solomon ([1 Kings 2:35](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:35)), back to Aaron, the high priest and Moses' brother. This list is clearly shortened, showing only sixteen generations from Aaron to eighty years after the exile in Babylon. In contrast, [1 Chronicles 6:3–15](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:3-1Chr6:15) lists twenty\-three generations from Aaron to the exile in Babylon.

* Ezra came from Babylon, where a large and successful Jewish community still existed.
* The Hebrew word for scribe sometimes means "secretary." It refers to an educated and trustworthy person who copied and explained official documents. Many scholars believe Ezra acted like a "Secretary of State for Jewish Affairs" in the Persian government. However, the focus here is on his role as a scribe, studying and teaching the five Books of Moses.

* Ezra and his group planned to leave Babylon on April 8 but actually departed on April 19, 458 BC ([Ezra 8:31](https://ref.ly/Ezra8:31)). During those eleven days, he organized the group, gathered at the Ahava Canal, searched for more Levites, and declared a fast.
* To cover the 800\-mile journey in four months, Ezra's group walked about ten miles per day, five days a week. Ezra knew his success was due to the gracious hand of his God (see also [Ezra 7:6](https://ref.ly/Ezra7:6), [28](https://ref.ly/Ezra7:28); [8:22](https://ref.ly/Ezra8:22), [31](https://ref.ly/Ezra8:31)).

* *the Law of your God*: The word translated as *law* in this verse is the Aramaic word *dath*, not the Hebrew *torah* ([Ezra 7:10](https://ref.ly/Ezra7:10)). This suggests that a Persian wrote this letter ([Ezra 7:11–26](https://ref.ly/Ezra7:11-Ezra7:26)).

*the God of heaven*: The Jews used this title for the Lord ([Ezra 5:11–12](https://ref.ly/Ezra5:11-Ezra5:12)), and Cyrus also used it ([1:2](https://ref.ly/Ezra1:2)). The Persian king likely believed, like others in the ancient Near East, that each country's god or gods controlled their territory. Artaxerxes did not want to risk angering God and disrupting the peace of his empire by failing to provide the worship God of Jerusalem required ([Ezra 7:19](https://ref.ly/Ezra7:19)).

* The events that follow occurred about four months after Ezra arrived (compare [Ezra 7:9](https://ref.ly/Ezra7:9); [10:9](https://ref.ly/Ezra10:9)).
* Intermarriage with non\-Israelites was risky because Israelites might worship other gods and adopt harmful religious practices (compare [Ezra 4:1–5](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:1-Ezra4:5); [Deuteronomy 7:1–4](https://ref.ly/Deut7:1-Deut7:4)).
* *the holy seed has been mixed*: Literally *the holy seed has intermingled itself.* Israel was a holy covenant nation ([Exodus 19:6](https://ref.ly/Exod19:6)) and was not supposed to engage in pagan practices ([Leviticus 19:2–4](https://ref.ly/Lev19:2-Lev19:4); [20:6–8](https://ref.ly/Lev20:6-Lev20:8), [22–26](https://ref.ly/Lev20:22-Lev20:26)). Therefore, the people were to avoid marrying those who might influence them to adopt such practices.

* *grace in the sight of the kings of Persia*: Babylon and Assyria had tortured and exiled their enemies ([2 Kings 17](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:1-2Kgs17:41); [25](https://ref.ly/2Kgs25:1-2Kgs25:30)), but Persia treated exiled people kindly and returned them to their homelands (see [Ezra 1:1–3](https://ref.ly/Ezra1:1-Ezra1:3)).
* *a wall of protection*: This phrase refers to God's presence protecting the nation of Judah, not the physical walls of Jerusalem, which Nehemiah rebuilt several years later.

## Ezra 10:3 (id: 11946)

* A covenant is a binding agreement. In this case, it refers to divorcing pagan wives whom the people of Israel had married inappropriately. By doing this, they would renew their commitment to the Sinai covenant.
* Women usually received custody of their children when a marriage ended (compare Hagar and Ishmael, [Genesis 21:14](https://ref.ly/Gen21:14)).

## Ezra 10:4 (id: 11948)

*this matter is your responsibility*: As an expert in the law (see [Ezra 7:10](https://ref.ly/Ezra7:10)), Ezra was responsible for guiding the people to a solution that honored God regarding intermarriage. Since the law of Moses did not provide clear instructions for divorcing pagan wives, Ezra needed to create a plan that aligned with Scripture and was fair to everyone involved.

## Ezra 10:15 (id: 11943)

It is unclear why these four people opposed the plan. They might have wanted a stricter penalty, or perhaps they or their family members did not want to divorce their foreign wives. The fact that there were only four dissenters shows the policy had overwhelming support among the rest of the exiles. Sadly, a few years later, a similar problem of intermarriage with foreign wives created another crisis within the community ([Nehemiah 9–10](https://ref.ly/Neh9:1-Neh10:39)).
