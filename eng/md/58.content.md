--------------------------------

## Hebrews 1:1 (id: 13080)

*On many past occasions*means the time before the Messiah's arrival. For the author of Hebrews, this mainly meant the Old Testament era. During that time, God spoke often and in various ways through:

* dreams,
* visions,
* powerful acts,
* stories,
* commands,
* encouragements,
* angelic appearances, and
* appearances of God himself.

The prophets were all those people through whom God shared his message (see [2 Peter 1:19–21](https://ref.ly/2Pet1:19-2Pet1:21)).

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 1:1

## Hebrews 1:1–2 (id: 13075)

*On many past occasions … but in these last days*: These verses compare two time periods when God spoke. Comparing the two periods side by side shows the differences between them.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 1:1–HEB 1:2

## Hebrews 1:1–4 (id: 13076)

Ancient sermons often began with an introduction. This introduction served two purposes:

1. to capture the listener's attention, and
2. to present the main topics.

In Hebrews, the first four verses are a single, elegant Greek sentence. The introduction presents the main idea: God has spoken. Most English translations break these verses into smaller sentences to make them easier to read.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 1:1–HEB 1:4

## Hebrews 1:2 (id: 13081)

* *These last days* refers to the historical period that began with Christ’s arrival (see [Isaiah 2:2](https://ref.ly/Isa2:2); [Acts 2:17](https://ref.ly/Acts2:17)). In the Old Testament era, revelations came in many forms over time. However, God’s ultimate revelation came through his Son, Jesus (see [Hebrews 2:3–4](https://ref.ly/Heb2:3-Heb2:4)).
* heir of all things*:* Christ is God’s royal heir. This is likely a reference to [Psalm 2:8](https://ref.ly/Ps2:8).

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 1:2

## Hebrews 1:3 (id: 13082)

* The Greek word translated *radiance* is found only here in the New Testament. It means intense brightness. God's glory shows his presence ([Exodus 16:7](https://ref.ly/Exod16:7); [33:18](https://ref.ly/Exod33:18); [Isaiah 40:5](https://ref.ly/Isa40:5)). The Son's glory reflects God's glory, showing God's presence ([Luke 9:32](https://ref.ly/Luke9:32); [John 1:14](https://ref.ly/John1:14); [2:11](https://ref.ly/John2:11); [17:5](https://ref.ly/John17:5); [Romans 8:17](https://ref.ly/Rom8:17)).

* The Greek word translated *exact representation* is also unique in the New Testament. It refers to a mark like one on a coin. The Son clearly shows God's character ([John 1:18](https://ref.ly/John1:18); [Philippians 2:6](https://ref.ly/Phil2:6); [Colossians 1:15](https://ref.ly/Col1:15)).
* *His powerful word*: This phrase means God's word is a strong and active force that created and controls the world ([Hebrews 11:3](https://ref.ly/Heb11:3); [Psalm 33:6–11](https://ref.ly/Ps33:6-Ps33:11)). The Son is also called "the Word of God" ([Revelation 19:13](https://ref.ly/Rev19:13); see also [John 1:1–18](https://ref.ly/John1:1-John1:18)).
* He cleansed us from our sins (see [Hebrews 9:11–10:18](https://ref.ly/Heb9:11-Heb10:18)).
* *He sat down*: This refers to [Psalm 110:1](https://ref.ly/Ps110:1) (see also [Hebrews 1:13](https://ref.ly/Heb1:13); [8:1](https://ref.ly/Heb8:1); [10:12](https://ref.ly/Heb10:12); [12:2](https://ref.ly/Heb12:2)). The Psalm predicted Christ's honor after his suffering (see [Matthew 22:44](https://ref.ly/Matt22:44); [Acts 2:33](https://ref.ly/Acts2:33); [1 Corinthians 15:25](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:25)). The right hand of God shows high honor and position (see [1 Kings 2:19](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:19); [Psalms 16:11](https://ref.ly/Ps16:11); [45:4](https://ref.ly/Ps45:4), [9](https://ref.ly/Ps45:9); [80:17](https://ref.ly/Ps80:17)).

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 1:3

## Hebrews 1:4 (id: 13083)

* The Son's high position shows that the Son is much greater than the angels in status or rank. First\-century Jews admired angels and respected them greatly. By comparing him to the angels, the author of Hebrews emphasizes the Son's superiority over them.
* *as the name He has inherited is excellent beyond theirs**:* Compare [2 Samuel 7:8–14](https://ref.ly/2Sam7:8-2Sam7:14). Some commentators believe that the title "Son" is the *name* implied here. Others think the name is *Yahweh,* the covenant name of God in the Old Testament ([Exodus 3:14–15](https://ref.ly/Exod3:14-Exod3:15); compare [Philippians 2:9–11](https://ref.ly/Phil2:9-Phil2:11)).

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 1:4

## Hebrews 1:5 (id: 13085)

* *did God ever say*: This verse quotes [Psalm 2:7](https://ref.ly/Ps2:7) and [2 Samuel 7:14](https://ref.ly/2Sam7:14). By raising Jesus to his right hand, the Father declared his special relationship with the Son (see [Acts 1:9–11](https://ref.ly/Acts1:9-Acts1:11); [2:32–36](https://ref.ly/Acts2:32-Acts2:36); [7:55–56](https://ref.ly/Acts7:55-Acts7:56)).
* *Today I have become your Father* (literally *Today I have begotten You*): Jesus did not *become* the Son at the exaltation (when God raised Jesus to heaven and gave him the highest honor). He had been involved in creation ([Hebrews 1:2](https://ref.ly/Heb1:2)). The exaltation confirmed his identity to everyone.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 1:5

## Hebrews 1:5–14 (id: 13084)

In these ten verses, the writer uses many Old Testament passages to prove that Jesus is greater than the angels. In ancient Jewish and Christian teaching, people often placed several Old Testament passages together in a row. This practice was called “chain quotations” or “pearl stringing.” The goal was to convince the listeners or readers of a truth by giving a strong group of scriptural proofs at once.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 1:5–HEB 1:14

## Hebrews 1:6 (id: 13086)

* The supreme (or *firstborn*) *Son* was understood to have certain rights. The firstborn son shared the father's authority. A firstborn also inherited most of the father's property and was especially favored. In the New Testament, "firstborn" often refers to Christ's supreme status in both the church and the world. His resurrection is often cited as proof of this status ([Acts 13:33](https://ref.ly/Acts13:33); [Romans 1:4](https://ref.ly/Rom1:4); [8:29](https://ref.ly/Rom8:29); [Colossians 1:15](https://ref.ly/Col1:15), [18](https://ref.ly/Col1:18); [Revelation 1:5](https://ref.ly/Rev1:5); compare [Hebrews 12:23](https://ref.ly/Heb12:23), where believers are called firstborn children).
* *"Let all God's angels worship him.":* This quotation from [Deuteronomy 32:43](https://ref.ly/Deut32:43) shows that angels are of lower status because they worship the Son (see also [Psalm 97:7](https://ref.ly/Ps97:7)).

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 1:6

## Hebrews 1:7 (id: 13087)

* This verse quotes [Psalm 104:4](https://ref.ly/Ps104:4) to show that angels are messengers or servants. They have a lower rank than the Son, whom they serve.
* In the Old Testament, angels are sometimes associated with winds and fire (see [Exodus 3:2](https://ref.ly/Exod3:2); [Judges 6:21](https://ref.ly/Judg6:21); [13:16](https://ref.ly/Judg13:16), [20](https://ref.ly/Judg13:20); [2 Samuel 22:11](https://ref.ly/2Sam22:11); [Psalms 18:10](https://ref.ly/Ps18:10); [35:5](https://ref.ly/Ps35:5)). This shows the angels’ connection with God’s rule over nature.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 1:7

## Hebrews 1:8–9 (id: 13088)

* These verses, quoting [Psalm 45:6–7](https://ref.ly/Ps45:6-Ps45:7), declare the Son as the divine, just, eternal, anointed King of the universe.

* *But about the Son He says*: Jesus is called God. In [Hebrews 1:9](https://ref.ly/Heb1:9), "your God" refers to God the Father.
* *has anointed you … with the oil of joy*: Olive oil was used to anoint Israel's kings when they began their rule ([1 Samuel 10:1](https://ref.ly/1Sam10:1); [1 Kings 19:15–16](https://ref.ly/1Kgs19:15-1Kgs19:16)). To anoint someone was to pour oil on that person’s head as a public sign that God had chosen them for a special role. God has anointed his Son, Jesus Christ, as King.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 1:8–HEB 1:9

## Hebrews 1:10–12 (id: 13077)

These verses, quoting [Psalm 102:25–27](https://ref.ly/Ps102:25-Ps102:27), celebrate the Son as both the creator and the one who ends creation. All created things will wear out like old clothing*,* and the Son will discard them (compare [Hebrews 2:5](https://ref.ly/Heb2:5); [2 Peter 3:13](https://ref.ly/2Pet3:13); [Revelation 21:1](https://ref.ly/Rev21:1)). In contrast, the Son of God will live forever.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 1:10–HEB 1:12

## Hebrews 1:13 (id: 13078)

* The author ends this series of Old Testament quotes by citing [Psalm 110:1](https://ref.ly/Ps110:1). This verse celebrates Christ's exaltation (see also study notes on Luke 20:42–43; 22:69; 1 Corinthians 15:25; Ephesians 1:19–22).
* The image of the Son's enemies as a footstool under his feet shows their complete defeat (see [Hebrews 2:8](https://ref.ly/Heb2:8)). In ancient times, a victorious king would place his foot on an enemy's neck or back as a sign of control.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 1:13
* **Associated Articles:** Ephesians 1:19-20 (ID: `10754@TyndaleStudyNotes`); Hebrews 1:5-14 (ID: `13084@Unknown`); Luke 20:42-43 (ID: `20777@TyndaleStudyNotes`); Luke 22:69 (ID: `20851@TyndaleStudyNotes`); 1 Corinthians 15:25 (ID: `13826@TyndaleStudyNotes`)

## Hebrews 1:14 (id: 13079)

*Are not the angels ministering spirits*: The author repeats his conclusion. God sends angels to help his people, who will receive salvation at the end of time (see [Hebrews 9:28](https://ref.ly/Heb9:28)).

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 1:14

## Hebrews 2:1 (id: 13213)

* *What we have hear*d is the message of salvation delivered through Christ ([Hebrews 2:3](https://ref.ly/Heb2:3)).
* *So that we do not drift away* is like a ship going off course. Here, it means losing spiritual focus by not paying close attention to the Good News.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 2:1

## Hebrews 2:1–4 (id: 13204)

The author argues from a smaller example to a larger one. In the Old Testament era, people who rejected God’s word delivered by angels were punished. If that was true, then the punishment will be even greater for those who now reject the message of salvation. This message has been given by the Son himself and confirmed by the Holy Spirit.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 2:1–HEB 2:4

## Hebrews 2:2 (id: 13214)

* According to Jewish tradition, God gave the law on Mount Sinai through angelss (see [Acts 7:38](https://ref.ly/Acts7:38); [Galatians 3:19](https://ref.ly/Gal3:19)).
* Breaking the law led to punishment (see [Exodus 22:19](https://ref.ly/Exod22:19); [Leviticus 20:10](https://ref.ly/Lev20:10); [Numbers 35:16–21](https://ref.ly/Num35:16-Num35:21)). The punishment could not be escaped (see [Proverbs 1:24–31](https://ref.ly/Prov1:24-Prov1:31); [Jeremiah 11:11](https://ref.ly/Jer11:11)).

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 2:2

## Hebrews 2:3 (id: 13215)

* Why do we think we can avoid consequences? The author emphasizes the serious danger of rejecting Christ and his salvation. There is no escape from punishment for those who turn away, and the punishment will be very severe (see [Hebrews 6:4–12](https://ref.ly/Heb6:4-Heb6:12); [10:26–31](https://ref.ly/Heb10:26-Heb10:31); [12:29](https://ref.ly/Heb12:29); [Romans 2:5](https://ref.ly/Rom2:5); [1 Thessalonians 2:16](https://ref.ly/1Thess2:16)).
* Salvation means God's actions to help his people. For example, God saved his people when he brought them out of Egypt in the exodus ([Deuteronomy 26:5–9](https://ref.ly/Deut26:5-Deut26:9)). In the New Testament, salvation generally refers to Christ's sacrificial death on the cross. This action saved people from the consequences of sin and gave them new life ([Hebrews 5:9–10](https://ref.ly/Heb5:9-Heb5:10)). Jesus first announced this salvation himself (for example, [Matthew 4:17](https://ref.ly/Matt4:17); [9:35](https://ref.ly/Matt9:35); [Mark 1:15](https://ref.ly/Mark1:15); [Luke 13:1–5](https://ref.ly/Luke13:1-Luke13:5)). He then confirmed the message through those who heard him speak (for example, [Mark 6:12](https://ref.ly/Mark6:12); [Acts 2:38](https://ref.ly/Acts2:38); [3:19–20](https://ref.ly/Acts3:19-Acts3:20)).

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 2:3

## Hebrews 2:4 (id: 13216)

*affirmed by God*: God himself proved the truth of Christ's message and his followers. He provided signs, wonders, various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit (see [Acts 2:22](https://ref.ly/Acts2:22); [Romans 15:19](https://ref.ly/Rom15:19); [2 Corinthians 12:12](https://ref.ly/2Cor12:12)).

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 2:4

## Hebrews 2:5 (id: 13218)

*it is not to angels:* Compare [Hebrews 1:13](https://ref.ly/Heb1:13).

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 2:5

## Hebrews 2:5–9 (id: 13217)

The author of Hebrews uses [Psalm 8:4–6](https://ref.ly/Ps8:4-Ps8:6) to shift from discussing Christ's divine nature in [Hebrews 1:5](https://ref.ly/Heb1:5-Heb1:14)[–](https://ref.ly/Ps8:4-Ps8:6)[14](https://ref.ly/Heb1:5-Heb1:14) to his human nature in [2:10](https://ref.ly/Heb2:10-Heb2:18)[–](https://ref.ly/Ps8:4-Ps8:6)[18](https://ref.ly/Heb2:10-Heb2:18). [Psalm 8](https://ref.ly/Ps8:1-Ps8:9) is often paired with [Psalm 110:1](https://ref.ly/Ps110:1) (see [Hebrews 1:13](https://ref.ly/Heb1:13)) to describe how all creation submits to Christ (see [1 Corinthians 15:25](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:25-1Cor15:27)[–](https://ref.ly/Ps8:4-Ps8:6)[27](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:25-1Cor15:27); [Ephesians 1:20](https://ref.ly/Eph1:20-Eph1:23)[–](https://ref.ly/Ps8:4-Ps8:6)[23](https://ref.ly/Eph1:20-Eph1:23)). Christ is the perfect human. In his exaltation, he achieves true dominion over creation, something humanity could not do.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 2:5–HEB 2:9

## Hebrews 2:6 (id: 13220)

* *What is man*: These lines of the psalm highlight God's special care for humans.
* *the son of Man*: The term *son of man* refers to human life and is similar to *man* in the previous line. In the Gospels, Jesus often used this phrase to describe himself.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 2:6

## Hebrews 2:6–8 (id: 13219)

These verses quote [Psalm 8:4–6](https://ref.ly/Ps8:4-Ps8:6). [Psalm 8](https://ref.ly/Ps8:1-Ps8:9) talks about the position God has given to humanity. The author of Hebrews uses the verse to predict Christ, who fulfills and represents humanity.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 2:6–HEB 2:8

## Hebrews 2:7 (id: 13221)

* *him:* This refers to all of humanity and specifically to Christ (see study note on 2:6–8).
* Christ became *a little lower than the angels* (or *a little while lower*). In other words, Christ became like other humans (see also [Philippians 2:5–8](https://ref.ly/Phil2:5-Phil2:8)).
* *crowned him with glory and honor*: Because of his suffering, he was given the highest honor and praise (see [Hebrews 2:9](https://ref.ly/Heb2:9); [Philippians 2:9–11](https://ref.ly/Phil2:9-Phil2:11)).

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 2:7
* **Associated Articles:** Hebrews 2:6-8 (ID: `13219@TyndaleStudyNotes`)

## Hebrews 2:8 (id: 13222)

* *placed everything under his feet*: See study note on 2:6–8.
* *He left nothing outside of his control*: All things are ultimately under the authority of Christ and the church. However, we have not yet seen this fully happen. Only at the end of the age (the final period of time when Jesus returns) will it be completed.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 2:8
* **Associated Articles:** Hebrews 2:6-8 (ID: `13219@TyndaleStudyNotes`)

## Hebrews 2:9 (id: 13223)

*But we see Jesus*: How can the church continue when evil and death exist? We look to Jesus in his human life, where he was "a little lower than the angels." We also look to him in his exaltation, where he is now "crowned with glory and honor." His suffering as a human led to his exaltation (see [Philippians 2:5–11](https://ref.ly/Phil2:5-Phil2:11); compare [Isaiah 52:13–53:12](https://ref.ly/Isa52:13-Isa53:12)). See also [Hebrews 12:1–13](https://ref.ly/Heb12:1-Heb12:13).

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 2:9

## Hebrews 2:10 (id: 13206)

* *sons*: The author uses the title *Son* for Jesus and refers to God's people as *sons*. The translation *children* clarifies that it includes all of God's people, both male and female.
* The term *author* had many meanings in the ancient world. It could also mean *founder,* *hero,* *champion, prince, captain, leader,* or *scout.* Jesus is called the *author* because he began the work of salvation and guides people to glory.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 2:10

## Hebrews 2:10–18 (id: 13205)

This passage suggests at least four reasons why the Son of God became human. 

1. It was appropriate: It aligns with God's character to achieve salvation this way ([Hebrews 2:10](https://ref.ly/Heb2:10)).
2. Jesus needed to become human to die ([2:14](https://ref.ly/Heb2:14)).
3. According to Old Testament law, high priests had to be chosen from among God's people ([2:17](https://ref.ly/Heb2:17)).
4. Jesus became a compassionate priest by experiencing human suffering and challenges ([2:18](https://ref.ly/Heb2:18)).

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 2:10–HEB 2:18

## Hebrews 2:11 (id: 13207)

* *of the same family* (literally *are all out of one*): In this context, "Father" likely refers to God. However, the author might have been thinking of Abraham as a shared ancestor (see [Hebrews 2:16](https://ref.ly/Heb2:16)) or of human nature as a shared experience (*out of one nature*).
* *brothers*: The Greek word *adelphoi* is a general term for family members, both male and female.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 2:11

## Hebrews 2:12 (id: 13208)

This verse quotes [Psalm 22:22](https://ref.ly/Ps22:22) and discusses the term brothers and sisters in [Hebrews 2:11](https://ref.ly/Heb2:11). [Psalm 22](https://ref.ly/Ps22:1-Ps22:31) includes important prophecies about Christ's suffering ([Psalm 22:1](https://ref.ly/Ps22:1), [7–8](https://ref.ly/Ps22:7-Ps22:8), [16](https://ref.ly/Ps22:16-Ps22:18)[–](https://ref.ly/Ps22:7-Ps22:8)[18](https://ref.ly/Ps22:16-Ps22:18); see [Matthew 27:35](https://ref.ly/Matt27:35), [43](https://ref.ly/Matt27:43); [John 19:23](https://ref.ly/John19:23-John19:24)[–](https://ref.ly/Ps22:7-Ps22:8)[24](https://ref.ly/John19:23-John19:24), [31](https://ref.ly/John19:31-John19:36)[–](https://ref.ly/Ps22:7-Ps22:8)[36](https://ref.ly/John19:31-John19:36)).

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 2:13

## Hebrews 2:14–15 (id: 13210)

* The death of the Son of God as a sacrifice for sin weakened the devil's power. It made the devil's power over death ineffective ([1 Corinthians 15:56](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:56)).
* Philo, a first\-century Jewish philosopher, wrote that "nothing enslaves the mind like fearing death" (Philo, *That Every Good Person Is Free* 3\.22\). Through his sacrificial death, Christ freed those who were slaves to the fear of dying.

* *holy brothers*: In ancient times, speakers and writers often called religious groups "brothers" (Greek *adelphoi*), including both men and women. Many modern translations use "brothers and sisters."
* *set your focus on Jesus*: Focusing on Jesus helps you stay strong in your faith ([Hebrews 2:9](https://ref.ly/Heb2:9); [12:1–2](https://ref.ly/Heb12:1-Heb12:2)).
* *the apostle*: This term may emphasize the Son’s role in sharing God’s name and message ([2:12](https://ref.ly/Heb2:12); [Matt 10:40](https://ref.ly/Matt10:40); [Mark 9:37](https://ref.ly/Mark9:37); [Luke 10:16](https://ref.ly/Luke10:16)).

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 3:1

Jesus was loyal to God and the mission given to him by the Father ([Hebrews 5:7](https://ref.ly/Heb5:7-Heb5:10)[–](https://ref.ly/Ps22:7-Ps22:8)[10](https://ref.ly/Heb5:7-Heb5:10); [12:1](https://ref.ly/Heb12:1-Heb12:3)[–](https://ref.ly/Ps22:7-Ps22:8)[3](https://ref.ly/Heb12:1-Heb12:3); [Philippians 2:5](https://ref.ly/Phil2:5-Phil2:11)[–](https://ref.ly/Ps22:7-Ps22:8)[11](https://ref.ly/Phil2:5-Phil2:11)), just like Moses was ([Numbers 12:7](https://ref.ly/Num12:7)). Many Jews in the first century saw Moses as the greatest person in history, even more important than angels.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 3:2

## Hebrews 3:3–6 (id: 13235)

Jesus deserves more glory for two reasons:

1. A person who builds a house deserves more praise than the house itself. The Messiah is the one who builds God’s house (see [2 Samuel 7:13](https://ref.ly/2Sam7:13)). This implies that Moses is part of the house (God’s people) that God has built.
2. While Moses was a servant in God’s house, Christ, as the Son, is the heir in charge of God’s entire house. Sons have a higher status than household servants.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 3:3–HEB 3:6

## Hebrews 3:6 (id: 13236)

We belong to God's house if we act courageously. The author could not fully assure those who were drifting away from Christ and the church. Those who continue in faith can be sure they are part of God's house (see [Hebrews 3:14](https://ref.ly/Heb3:14); [Romans 8:9](https://ref.ly/Rom8:9), [17](https://ref.ly/Rom8:17); [11:22](https://ref.ly/Rom11:22); [2 Corinthians 13:5](https://ref.ly/2Cor13:5); [Colossians 1:22](https://ref.ly/Col1:22-Col1:23)[–](https://ref.ly/Ps22:7-Ps22:8)[23](https://ref.ly/Col1:22-Col1:23)).

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 3:6

## Hebrews 3:7–19 (id: 13237)

This passage serves as a warning, showing the negative example of those who wandered in the wilderness for forty years and died there. The wilderness wanderings symbolize disobedience to God and its consequences (see [Numbers 32:7](https://ref.ly/Num32:7-Num32:11)[–](https://ref.ly/Ps22:7-Ps22:8)[11](https://ref.ly/Num32:7-Num32:11); [Deuteronomy 1:19](https://ref.ly/Deut1:19-Deut1:35)[–](https://ref.ly/Ps22:7-Ps22:8)[35](https://ref.ly/Deut1:19-Deut1:35); [Psalm 106:24](https://ref.ly/Ps106:24-Ps106:26)[–](https://ref.ly/Ps22:7-Ps22:8)[26](https://ref.ly/Ps106:24-Ps106:26)).

## Hebrews 3:8 (id: 13238)

The Israelites rebelled and tested God in places like Massah and Meribah, where water was scarce ([Exodus 17:1](https://ref.ly/Exod17:1-Exod17:7)[–](https://ref.ly/Ps22:7-Ps22:8)[7](https://ref.ly/Exod17:1-Exod17:7); [Numbers 20:2](https://ref.ly/Num20:2-Num20:13)[–](https://ref.ly/Ps22:7-Ps22:8)[13](https://ref.ly/Num20:2-Num20:13)). They especially disobeyed at Kadesh by refusing to enter the promised land ([Hebrews 3:10](https://ref.ly/Heb3:10); see [Numbers 14:1](https://ref.ly/Num14:1-Num14:25)[–](https://ref.ly/Ps22:7-Ps22:8)[25](https://ref.ly/Num14:1-Num14:25); [Deuteronomy 1:19](https://ref.ly/Deut1:19-Deut1:46)[–](https://ref.ly/Ps22:7-Ps22:8)[46](https://ref.ly/Deut1:19-Deut1:46); [Psalm 106](https://ref.ly/Ps106:1-Ps106:48)).

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 3:8

## Hebrews 3:9–10 (id: 13239)

Even after witnessing the miracles God performed for them, the people of Israel tested God's patience by not trusting him in the wilderness ([Numbers 14:11](https://ref.ly/Num14:11), [22](https://ref.ly/Num14:22)). Their rebellion stemmed from their hearts consistently turning away from God. They did not want to obey God. As a result, God became angry with them.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 3:9–HEB 3:10

## Hebrews 3:11 (id: 13225)

* Rebellion has consequences.
* God’s anger is not just an emotional reaction. It is his fair and just response to sin ([John 3:36](https://ref.ly/John3:36); [Romans 1:18](https://ref.ly/Rom1:18); [1 Thessalonians 2:16](https://ref.ly/1Thess2:16)).

## Hebrews 3:12 (id: 13227)

*heart of unbelief that turns away from the living God*: An evil heart stubbornly resists the Lord because of unbelief, leading a person to turn away from the living God.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 3:12

## Hebrews 3:12–19 (id: 13226)

The author of Hebrews points to important words from [Psalm 95](https://ref.ly/Ps95:1-Ps95:11). These include *heart,* *today*, *hear*, *enter,* *rest*, and *unbelief*. In the ancient world, Bible teachers would cite a passage from the Old Testament and then explain it. They often highlighted key words from the passage, much like preachers do today. This style of explanation was called *midrash* (a type of Jewish Bible interpretation).

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 3:12–HEB 3:19

## Hebrews 3:13 (id: 13228)

The author uses the word "today" from [Psalms 95:7](https://ref.ly/Ps95:7) to urge people to remind each other daily about the misleading and toughening effects of sin.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 3:13

## Hebrews 3:14 (id: 13229)

If we stay faithful, we can be sure we belong to God's family (see [Hebrews 3:6](https://ref.ly/Heb3:6); [Romans 8:9](https://ref.ly/Rom8:9), [17](https://ref.ly/Rom8:17); [11:22](https://ref.ly/Rom11:22); [2 Corinthians 13:5](https://ref.ly/2Cor13:5); [Colossians 1:22](https://ref.ly/Col1:22-Col1:23)[–](https://ref.ly/Ps22:7-Ps22:8)[23](https://ref.ly/Col1:22-Col1:23)).

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 3:14

## Hebrews 3:15 (id: 13230)

This verse quotes [Psalm 95:7–8](https://ref.ly/Ps95:7-Ps95:8), urging readers to listen and respond positively to God's voice. It summarizes the author's message in [Hebrews 3:12–14](https://ref.ly/Heb3:12-Heb3:14).

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 3:15

## Hebrews 3:16–19 (id: 13231)

These verses use a series of quick questions and answers, a common rhetorical method. The three questions follow the ideas in [Psalm 95:8](https://ref.ly/Ps95:8-Ps95:11)[–](https://ref.ly/Ps22:7-Ps22:8)[11](https://ref.ly/Ps95:8-Ps95:11): The people of Israel rebelled against God, God was angry, and God swore they would never enter his rest. The answers come from other Old Testament passages about the Israelites' rebellion in the wilderness ([Numbers 14](https://ref.ly/Num14:1-Num14:45); [Deuteronomy 9](https://ref.ly/Deut9:1-Deut9:29); [Psalm 106](https://ref.ly/Ps106:1-Ps106:48)). The author emphasizes the severe consequences of disobeying God.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 3:16–HEB 3:19

## Hebrews 3:19 (id: 13232)

In Hebrews and the Old Testament, unbelief and disobedience are closely linked ([Numbers 14:11](https://ref.ly/Num14:11); [Deuteronomy 9:23](https://ref.ly/Deut9:23); [Psalm 78:22](https://ref.ly/Ps78:22), [32](https://ref.ly/Ps78:32)). Because of their disobedience, they could not enter God's rest by entering the land of Canaan ([Deuteronomy 3:20](https://ref.ly/Deut3:20); [12:10](https://ref.ly/Deut12:10); [Joshua 1:13](https://ref.ly/Josh1:13)).

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 3:19

## Hebrews 4:1 (id: 13249)

*let us be careful*: Fearing God means having a deep respect and awe for God and God's will. Missing out on God's promises would be a great tragedy.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 4:1

## Hebrews 4:1–2 (id: 13240)

The author moves to the promise that the faithful will enter God's rest and urges listeners to take this promise seriously. Hearing alone is not enough. Listening must be combined with faith.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 4:1–HEB 4:2

## Hebrews 4:2 (id: 13250)

* This good news is the message of salvation ([Hebrews 2:3](https://ref.ly/Heb2:3-Heb2:4)[–](https://ref.ly/Ps22:7-Ps22:8)[4](https://ref.ly/Heb2:3-Heb2:4)).
* They lacked the faith of those who listened to God. Some manuscripts say *they didn’t combine what they heard with faith.* In both cases, the listeners had weak faith and did not trust God's promise.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 4:2

## Hebrews 4:3 (id: 13251)

* People who believe the good news are the true heirs of God's rest, which is the salvation offered through Christ's sacrifice.
* *God has said*: The quote from [Psalm 95:11](https://ref.ly/Ps95:11) reminds us that the unbelieving rebels in the wilderness would never enter God's place of rest (compare [Hebrews 11:8](https://ref.ly/Heb11:8), [10](https://ref.ly/Heb11:10), [14](https://ref.ly/Heb11:14-Heb11:16)[–](https://ref.ly/Ps22:7-Ps22:8)[16](https://ref.ly/Heb11:14-Heb11:16); [12:22](https://ref.ly/Heb12:22-Heb12:24)[–](https://ref.ly/Ps22:7-Ps22:8)[24](https://ref.ly/Heb12:22-Heb12:24)).

## Hebrews 4:6 (id: 13254)

*it remains for some to enter His rest*: Building on the discussion in [Hebrews 4:3–5](https://ref.ly/Heb4:3-Heb4:5), the author will argue that the promised rest is still open ([4:7](https://ref.ly/Heb4:7-Heb4:10)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb4:3-Heb4:5)[10](https://ref.ly/Heb4:7-Heb4:10)). Those who wandered in the wilderness heard the good news that the promised land was open to them. They were not able to enter because they disobeyed God (see [Numbers 14:1](https://ref.ly/Num14:1-Num14:25)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb4:3-Heb4:5)[25](https://ref.ly/Num14:1-Num14:25); [Deuteronomy 1:19](https://ref.ly/Deut1:19-Deut1:46)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb4:3-Heb4:5)[46](https://ref.ly/Deut1:19-Deut1:46); [Psalm 106](https://ref.ly/Ps106:1-Ps106:48)).

## Hebrews 4:7 (id: 13255)

*God again designated a certain day as “Today,”*: David wrote [Psalm 95](https://ref.ly/Ps95:1-Ps95:11) long after the events in the wilderness, so God's rest is not just for that earlier generation. The words from [Psalm 95:7](https://ref.ly/Ps95:7-Ps95:8)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb4:3-Heb4:5)[8](https://ref.ly/Ps95:7-Ps95:8) urge us not to harden our hearts when we hear God's voice, so we can enter the rest that the people in the wilderness missed. This chance is available today (see [Hebrews 3:13](https://ref.ly/Heb3:13)).

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 4:7

## Hebrews 4:8 (id: 13256)

Joshua and Jesus share the same name (Greek *Iēsous,* Hebrew *Yehoshua‘*). In the Old Testament, it is usually translated as *Joshua*, and in the New Testament, as *Jesus* (see also study note on Exodus 17:9). The author is making a wordplay on their shared name. Joshua led God's people into the promised land ([Joshua 3–4](https://ref.ly/Josh3:1-Josh4:24)), but God meant more when he promised rest. Jesus provides God's ultimate rest ([Hebrews 3:13](https://ref.ly/Heb3:13-Heb3:14)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb4:3-Heb4:5)[14](https://ref.ly/Heb3:13-Heb3:14); [4:3](https://ref.ly/Heb4:3), [9](https://ref.ly/Heb4:9-Heb4:11)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb4:3-Heb4:5)[11](https://ref.ly/Heb4:9-Heb4:11), [14](https://ref.ly/Heb4:14-Heb4:16)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb4:3-Heb4:5)[16](https://ref.ly/Heb4:14-Heb4:16)).

*a Sabbath rest*: The sacrifice of Jesus worked like a Day of Atonement sacrifice ([Hebrews 5:1](https://ref.ly/Heb5:1-Heb5:3)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb4:3-Heb4:5)[3](https://ref.ly/Heb5:1-Heb5:3); [9:13](https://ref.ly/Heb9:13-Heb9:22)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb4:3-Heb4:5)[22](https://ref.ly/Heb9:13-Heb9:22); see [Leviticus 23:26](https://ref.ly/Lev23:26-Lev23:28)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb4:3-Heb4:5)[28](https://ref.ly/Lev23:26-Lev23:28), [32](https://ref.ly/Lev23:32)).

* *us … no one*: Obedience is not just a personal issue. God's people have a shared responsibility to obey and should support each other in this effort (compare [3:13](https://ref.ly/Heb3:13); [10:25](https://ref.ly/Heb10:25); [12:15](https://ref.ly/Heb12:15)).

## Hebrews 4:12–13 (id: 13243)

The author urges us to listen to God's voice, as mentioned in [Hebrews 3:7](https://ref.ly/Heb3:7), [15](https://ref.ly/Heb3:15), and [4:7](https://ref.ly/Heb4:7), quoting [Psalm 95:7](https://ref.ly/Ps95:7). They describe God's word as alive and powerful, meaning it is an active and effective force. The word that created and controls the universe ([Hebrews 1:2](https://ref.ly/Heb1:2-Heb1:3)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb4:3-Heb4:5)[3](https://ref.ly/Heb1:2-Heb1:3)) can also strongly influence people. It is like the sharpest two\-edged sword, able to reach the deepest parts of people's lives and reveal their thoughts and desires (see [Ephesians 6:17](https://ref.ly/Eph6:17); [Revelation 1:16](https://ref.ly/Rev1:16); [2:12](https://ref.ly/Rev2:12), [16](https://ref.ly/Rev2:16); [19:15](https://ref.ly/Rev19:15)).

## Hebrews 4:14 (id: 13246)

* This verse sums up the message and challenge of Hebrews. Jesus, the Son of God, is our high priest and the reason to stay strong in the Christian faith.
* *a great high priest*: Israel’s high priest was the main leader in worship and the mediator between God and the people (see [Exodus 31:10](https://ref.ly/Exod31:10); [Leviticus 4:3](https://ref.ly/Lev4:3); [2 Kings 12:10](https://ref.ly/2Kgs12:10); [2 Chronicles 26:20](https://ref.ly/2Chr26:20)).
* *who has passed through the heavens*: Earthly high priests entered God’s presence in the Most Holy Place once a year on the Day of Atonement ([Leviticus 16:1](https://ref.ly/Lev16:1-Lev16:25)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb4:3-Heb4:5)[25](https://ref.ly/Lev16:1-Lev16:25)). In contrast, Jesus, our high priest, has entered God’s presence in heaven and stays there ([Hebrews 7:26](https://ref.ly/Heb7:26); [9:11](https://ref.ly/Heb9:11-Heb9:12)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb4:3-Heb4:5)[12](https://ref.ly/Heb9:11-Heb9:12), [23](https://ref.ly/Heb9:23-Heb9:26)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb4:3-Heb4:5)[26](https://ref.ly/Heb9:23-Heb9:26)).
* *let us hold firmly*: Stay committed to actively believing in and being loyal to Jesus (see also [Colossians 2:19](https://ref.ly/Col2:19); [2 Thessalonians 2:15](https://ref.ly/2Thess2:15); [Revelation 2:13](https://ref.ly/Rev2:13), [25](https://ref.ly/Rev2:25); [3:11](https://ref.ly/Rev3:11)).

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 4:14–HEB 4:16

## Hebrews 4:15 (id: 13247)

* Our high priest understands our weaknesses and our tendency to sin because he faced the same challenges. He was tempted by lust, greed, unforgiveness, and dishonesty. This makes him compassionate as our high priest ([Hebrews 5:2](https://ref.ly/Heb5:2)).
* *yet was without sin*: Jesus is different from earthly high priests, who had to make offerings for their own sins before they could make offerings for the people ([5:3](https://ref.ly/Heb5:3); [7:26](https://ref.ly/Heb7:26-Heb7:28)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb4:3-Heb4:5)[28](https://ref.ly/Heb7:26-Heb7:28); see also [1 Peter 2:22](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:22-1Pet2:23)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb4:3-Heb4:5)[23](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:22-1Pet2:23)).

* Another requirement for high priests was to represent others by offering sacrifices for them ([7:25–28](https://ref.ly/Heb7:25-Heb7:28)). Only the high priest could offer the sacrifice on the Day of Atonement ([Exodus 29](https://ref.ly/Exod29:1-Exod29:46); [Leviticus 16:1–25](https://ref.ly/Lev16:1-Lev16:25)).

The phrase *with loud cries and tears* likely refers to Christ's suffering in the garden of Gethsemane (see [Matthew 26:36](https://ref.ly/Matt26:36-Matt26:46)[–](https://ref.ly/Lev8:1-Lev8:12)[46](https://ref.ly/Matt26:36-Matt26:46); [Mark 14:32](https://ref.ly/Mark14:32-Mark14:42)[–](https://ref.ly/Lev8:1-Lev8:12)[42](https://ref.ly/Mark14:32-Mark14:42); [Luke 22:40](https://ref.ly/Luke22:40-Luke22:46)[–](https://ref.ly/Lev8:1-Lev8:12)[46](https://ref.ly/Luke22:40-Luke22:46)). God heard his prayers by affirming his righteousness and his role as high priest. Jesus's faithful devotion serves as an example for the readers (compare [Hebrews 12:2](https://ref.ly/Heb12:2-Heb12:3)[–](https://ref.ly/Lev8:1-Lev8:12)[3](https://ref.ly/Heb12:2-Heb12:3)).

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 5:7

## Hebrews 5:7–10 (id: 13270)

The suffering of Jesus was the basis for his higher role as a priest. His humiliation and suffering came before his rise to glory ([Hebrews 2:9](https://ref.ly/Heb2:9); [Philippians 2:5](https://ref.ly/Phil2:5-Phil2:11)[–](https://ref.ly/Lev8:1-Lev8:12)[11](https://ref.ly/Phil2:5-Phil2:11)).

## Hebrews 5:8 (id: 13272)

He learned obedience through his suffering. Jesus was always obedient, even before his suffering. He lived his human life, including his death on the cross, fully submitting to God's will. We are expected to follow the same path ([Hebrews 12:1](https://ref.ly/Heb12:1-Heb12:11)[–](https://ref.ly/Lev8:1-Lev8:12)[11](https://ref.ly/Heb12:1-Heb12:11)).

Jesus became the source of eternal salvation for everyone who obeys him through his sufferings.
* As the Son obeyed the Father ([5:8](https://ref.ly/Heb5:8)), fully following the Father's will, those seeking *salvation* must *obey him.*

## Hebrews 5:12 (id: 13263)

* Their lack of spiritual energy was surprising because they had been believers for so long. They should have been spiritual leaders teaching others from their knowledge and Christian experience.
* *the basic principles*: The simplest parts of the Christian faith (see [Hebrews 6:1](https://ref.ly/Heb6:1-Heb6:3)[–](https://ref.ly/Lev8:1-Lev8:12)[3](https://ref.ly/Heb6:1-Heb6:3)).

These six basic teachings were fundamental parts of Jewish instruction. The author may be urging them to deepen their understanding of Christ, which he explains further in [7:1–10:25](https://ref.ly/Heb7:1-Heb10:25).

* The term *baptisms* (or washings) is plural, indicating it means more than just Christian baptism. In first\-century Judaism, teachings about different washings were common (see [Matthew 15:2](https://ref.ly/Matt15:2); [Mark 7:3](https://ref.ly/Mark7:3)). The author might also refer to the cleansing rituals from the Old Testament (compare [Hebrews 9:13](https://ref.ly/Heb9:13); [10:22](https://ref.ly/Heb10:22)).
* The laying on of hands was linked to:

    + healing ([Mark 5:22](https://ref.ly/Mark5:22-Mark5:23)[–](https://ref.ly/Lev8:1-Lev8:12)[23](https://ref.ly/Mark5:22-Mark5:23); [Luke 13:13](https://ref.ly/Luke13:13)),

## Hebrews 6:4–8 (id: 13287)

This passage is one of the most challenging in the New Testament. It warns about those who have abandoned the Christian faith. Those who have turned away from Christ and the church are like those who fell in the wilderness ([Hebrews 3:15](https://ref.ly/Heb3:15-Heb3:19)[–](https://ref.ly/Lev8:1-Lev8:12)[19](https://ref.ly/Heb3:15-Heb3:19)). Their lack of faith leads to severe judgment (compare [10:26](https://ref.ly/Heb10:26-Heb10:31)[–](https://ref.ly/Lev8:1-Lev8:12)[31](https://ref.ly/Heb10:26-Heb10:31)).

* *the powers of the coming age*: They witnessed signs and wonders when they heard the good news ([2:4](https://ref.ly/Heb2:4); compare [Exodus 7:3](https://ref.ly/Exod7:3-Exod7:4)[–](https://ref.ly/Lev8:1-Lev8:12)[4](https://ref.ly/Exod7:3-Exod7:4); [Deuteronomy 7:19](https://ref.ly/Deut7:19); [Psalms 66:3](https://ref.ly/Ps66:3); [77:15](https://ref.ly/Ps77:15-Ps77:20)[–](https://ref.ly/Lev8:1-Lev8:12)[20](https://ref.ly/Ps77:15-Ps77:20); [78:9](https://ref.ly/Ps78:9-Ps78:16)[–](https://ref.ly/Lev8:1-Lev8:12)[16](https://ref.ly/Ps78:9-Ps78:16); [1 Corinthians 10:1](https://ref.ly/1Cor10:1-1Cor10:13)[–](https://ref.ly/Lev8:1-Lev8:12)[13](https://ref.ly/1Cor10:1-1Cor10:13)).

* Rejecting the Son of God is like nailing him to the cross again. Crucifixion was the worst form of rejection and shame in the Greco\-Roman world. Those who turned away from Christ were like those who mocked him at the cross, denying he was the Messiah and Son of God, and instead deserving of shame (see [Matthew 27:39](https://ref.ly/Matt27:39-Matt27:44)[–](https://ref.ly/Lev8:1-Lev8:12)[44](https://ref.ly/Matt27:39-Matt27:44)).

By loving God and others, we follow the example of great faith leaders. The author stresses that faith and endurance are essential for God's people (see [11:4](https://ref.ly/Heb11:4-Heb11:38)[–](https://ref.ly/Lev8:1-Lev8:12)[38](https://ref.ly/Heb11:4-Heb11:38)).

## Hebrews 6:13–20 (id: 13279)

This passage highlights how we can trust God's promises. It uses an example ([Hebrews 6:13](https://ref.ly/Heb6:13-Heb6:15)[–](https://ref.ly/Lev8:1-Lev8:12)[15](https://ref.ly/Heb6:13-Heb6:15)), then explains a general rule ([6:16](https://ref.ly/Heb6:16)), and finally makes the main point: God made an important promise ([6:17](https://ref.ly/Heb6:17-Heb6:18)[–](https://ref.ly/Lev8:1-Lev8:12)[18](https://ref.ly/Heb6:17-Heb6:18)).

* God also made a promise with an oath (a solemn promise), see [Hebrews 7:20–22](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22). This oath shows that God will never change his mind because it is impossible for God to lie (see [Psalm 110:4](https://ref.ly/Ps110:4)).
* *We who have fled to take hold of the hope set before us*, similiar to people in the Old Testament who accidentally killed someone and sought refuge ([Numbers 35:9](https://ref.ly/Num35:9-Num35:34)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[34](https://ref.ly/Num35:9-Num35:34); [Deuteronomy 4:41](https://ref.ly/Deut4:41-Deut4:43)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[43](https://ref.ly/Deut4:41-Deut4:43)).

## Hebrews 6:19–20 (id: 13283)

* Christian hope is a reliable anchor for our souls. In the first century, an anchor symbolized stability and safety.
* *behind the curtain*: A curtain separated the outer room of the sanctuary, where only priests could enter, from the inner room, the Most Holy Place ([Exodus 25:10](https://ref.ly/Exod25:10-Exod25:40)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[40](https://ref.ly/Exod25:10-Exod25:40)). Only the high priest could enter the Most Holy Place, and only once a year on the Day of Atonement ([Exodus 29](https://ref.ly/Exod29:1-Exod29:46); [Leviticus 16:1](https://ref.ly/Lev16:1-Lev16:25)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[25](https://ref.ly/Lev16:1-Lev16:25)). Because of Jesus's unique high priesthood, he has already entered there for us into God's presence as our eternal High Priest, and he guides us in with him ([Hebrews 10:19](https://ref.ly/Heb10:19-Heb10:23)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[23](https://ref.ly/Heb10:19-Heb10:23)).

## Hebrews 7:2 (id: 13311)

* Abraham gave a tenth to the Lord by giving it to Melchizedek, his priest. This act foreshadows the giving of tithes under the law ([Leviticus 27:30](https://ref.ly/Lev27:30), [32](https://ref.ly/Lev27:32)) and is important in the author's argument ([Hebrews 7:4](https://ref.ly/Heb7:4)).
* Melchi\- (Hebrew *melek*) means king.
* \-zedek (Hebrew *tsedeq*) means justice or righteousness.
* Salem (Hebrew *shalom*) means peace. Rabbis often highlighted the theological meaning of a biblical figure's name by linking it to other Hebrew terms.

## Hebrews 7:3 (id: 13312)

* We have no record of Melchizedek’s family, which is important because the Levitical priesthood required ancestry. He seems to appear from nowhere, as if his life has no beginning or end. The author interprets [Genesis 14:17](https://ref.ly/Gen14:17-Gen14:20)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[20](https://ref.ly/Gen14:17-Gen14:20) with [Psalm 110:4](https://ref.ly/Ps110:4), seeing Melchizedek as symbolizing an eternal priesthood.
* He remains a priest forever, unlike a Levite whose priesthood ends at death ([Hebrews 7:8](https://ref.ly/Heb7:8), [23](https://ref.ly/Heb7:23)).
* *like the Son of God*: Melchizedek was not an Old Testament appearance of Jesus. Instead, his priesthood and the priesthood of Jesus share similar traits, as noted in [Psalm 110:4](https://ref.ly/Ps110:4).

## Hebrews 7:4 (id: 13313)

This section ([Hebrews 7:1](https://ref.ly/Heb7:1-Heb7:10)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[10](https://ref.ly/Heb7:1-Heb7:10)) asks us to think about how important Melchizedek was by comparing him to Levi's descendants. Melchizedek was so significant that Abraham gave him a tenth of the battle spoils ([Genesis 14:20](https://ref.ly/Gen14:20)).

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 7:4

## Hebrews 7:5–6 (id: 13314)

* Collecting the tithe was both a duty and an honor for the priests under the law of Moses ([Numbers 18:21](https://ref.ly/Num18:21-Num18:32)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[32](https://ref.ly/Num18:21-Num18:32)).
* *from the people*: This refers to all the people of Israel.
* Although Melchizedek was not a descendant of Levi*,* he collected a tenth from Abraham*,* the ancestor of the Levites. This shows Melchizedek’s greater status over both Abraham and his descendants, including the priests ([Hebrews 7:8](https://ref.ly/Heb7:8-Heb7:10)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[10](https://ref.ly/Heb7:8-Heb7:10)).

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 7:5–HEB 7:6

## Hebrews 7:6–7 (id: 13315)

Melchizedek blessed Abraham ([Genesis 14:19](https://ref.ly/Gen14:19-Gen14:20)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[20](https://ref.ly/Gen14:19-Gen14:20)). This blessing is like one a superior gives to a subordinate, such as a father blessing his son or a priest blessing his people ([Genesis 49:1](https://ref.ly/Gen49:1-Gen49:28)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[28](https://ref.ly/Gen49:1-Gen49:28); [Numbers 6:22](https://ref.ly/Num6:22-Num6:27)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[27](https://ref.ly/Num6:22-Num6:27)). The ability to give a blessing shows that Melchizedek is greater than Abraham.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 7:6–HEB 7:7

## Hebrews 7:8 (id: 13316)

One reason Melchizedek is greater than the Levites is his “immortality” ([7:3](https://ref.ly/Heb7:3)). The Levites were men who died, but Scripture says Melchizedek continues to live.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 7:8

## Hebrews 7:9–10 (id: 13317)

*And so to speak*: The author knows that saying the Levites paid a tithe to Melchizedek is not literally true, since Levi was not born yet. Abraham represented all his descendants when he paid his tithe to Melchizedek. Levi was connected to Abraham because he came from Abraham's lineage. All of Abraham's descendants were united with him. So, his action could be seen as their action.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 7:9–HEB 7:10

## Hebrews 7:11 (id: 13297)

In the Letter to the Hebrews, perfection means *achieving a desired goal* rather than being *flawless* (see study note on 5:9). The priesthood under the old covenant could not fulfill all of God's intentions for a covenant relationship with his people. This is why God needed to create a different priesthood.

## Hebrews 7:11–28 (id: 13296)

After explaining why Melchizedek is greater than the Levites ([Hebrews 7:1](https://ref.ly/Heb7:1-Heb7:10)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[10](https://ref.ly/Heb7:1-Heb7:10)), the author now argues that Jesus, our high priest like Melchizedek, is also greater than the Levitical priests of the old covenant.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 7:11–HEB 7:28

## Hebrews 7:12 (id: 13298)

According to the law given to Moses, the appointed priests were descendants of Aaron ([Exodus 28:41](https://ref.ly/Exod28:41-Exod28:43)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[43](https://ref.ly/Exod28:41-Exod28:43); [29:9](https://ref.ly/Exod29:9)). The priesthood changed because Jesus is now the high priest. So, God changed the law about priests.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 7:12

## Hebrews 7:13–14 (id: 13299)

*belonged to a different trib**e*: Under the old covenant, priests came from the tribe of Levi, but Jesus was from the tribe of Judah.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 7:13–HEB 7:14

## Hebrews 7:15–17 (id: 13300)

This change in how God appoints priests ([Hebrews 7:11](https://ref.ly/Heb7:11-Heb7:14)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[14](https://ref.ly/Heb7:11-Heb7:14)) is clear through Jesus being appointed as a different kind of priest. Like Melchizedek, Jesus is a priest forever. His resurrection from the dead shows he has the power of an indestructible life. Since his priesthood, in the order of Melchizedek, is superior to the Levites' ([7:1](https://ref.ly/Heb7:1-Heb7:10)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[10](https://ref.ly/Heb7:1-Heb7:10)), he replaces them as priest.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 7:15–HEB 7:17

## Hebrews 7:18 (id: 13301)

* The previous rule for becoming a priest was being part of Aaron's family (see [Exodus 28:41](https://ref.ly/Exod28:41-Exod28:43)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[43](https://ref.ly/Exod28:41-Exod28:43)).
* *set aside*: See [Hebrews 7:15](https://ref.ly/Heb7:15-Heb7:17)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[17](https://ref.ly/Heb7:15-Heb7:17).
* *because it was weak and useless*: This is explained in the following verses ([7:19](https://ref.ly/Heb7:19-Heb7:28)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[28](https://ref.ly/Heb7:19-Heb7:28)).

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 7:18

## Hebrews 7:19 (id: 13303)

The law never made anything perfect. It did not achieve what God intended through Jesus's superior high priesthood, which is to fully remove sin and ensure eternal salvation. This gives believers confidence in a better hope and a closer relationship with God. We can approach God without fearing judgment.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 7:19

## Hebrews 7:19–28 (id: 13302)

The priests under the old covenant were weak because they died, which ended their service, and they were also sinful. In contrast, Jesus is the new high priest. He never sinned and he defeated death, so his priesthood is permanent and more effective.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 7:19–HEB 7:28

## Hebrews 7:20–21 (id: 13305)

* This new system is about how God chooses a priest.
* God’s serious promise is shown in the quote from [Psalm 110:4](https://ref.ly/Ps110:4).

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 7:20–HEB 7:21

## Hebrews 7:22 (id: 13306)

Legally, the guarantor is the person who takes on the risk of someone else's investment or debt. Because of God's promise, Jesus's role as a priest is unbreakable, ensuring our relationship with God is safe. Jesus as the promise\-keeper improves the new covenant agreement.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 7:22

## Hebrews 7:23–24 (id: 13307)

The old covenant needed many priests because each one eventually died. In contrast, Jesus's priesthood is *permanent*. This term refers to something unchangeable, like the sun's daily path across the sky or the regular change of seasons.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 7:23–HEB 7:24

## Hebrews 7:25 (id: 13308)

* *able to save completely*: Since Jesus lives forever*,* the salvation he offers also lasts forever. To approach an eternal God, we need an eternal priest.
* Jesus will *intercede* or appeal to God for us as our high priest of the new covenant, and his intercession never ends (see [Hebrews 9:11](https://ref.ly/Heb9:11-Heb9:28)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[28](https://ref.ly/Heb9:11-Heb9:28); [10:21](https://ref.ly/Heb10:21-Heb10:22)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[22](https://ref.ly/Heb10:21-Heb10:22); [Romans 8:31](https://ref.ly/Rom8:31-Rom8:34)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[34](https://ref.ly/Rom8:31-Rom8:34)).

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 7:25

## Hebrews 7:26–27 (id: 13309)

* Jesus is free from sin and different from sinners (see [Hebrews 4:15](https://ref.ly/Heb4:15)). This makes him better than the old covenant priests, who had to handle their own sins and those of the people (see also [5:1](https://ref.ly/Heb5:1-Heb5:3)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[3](https://ref.ly/Heb5:1-Heb5:3)).
* He holds the highest place of honor in heaven, affirming his unique role as high priest (see [2:9](https://ref.ly/Heb2:9); [5:9](https://ref.ly/Heb5:9); [Philippians 2:5](https://ref.ly/Phil2:5-Phil2:11)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[11](https://ref.ly/Phil2:5-Phil2:11)).
* *once for all*: This means *once, never to be repeated*, not *once for all people*.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 7:26–HEB 7:27

## Hebrews 7:28 (id: 13310)

* This verse summarizes the discussion in [5:1–3](https://ref.ly/Heb5:1-Heb5:3) about Christ's role as High Priest ([5:1–10](https://ref.ly/Heb5:1-Heb5:10); [7:1–28](https://ref.ly/Heb7:1-Heb7:28)).

* Limited by human weakness refers primarily to human sinfulness and mortality.
* God appointed his Son, Jesus, with an oath (see [Psalm 110:4](https://ref.ly/Ps110:4), which is important for understanding [Hebrews 7:11–28](https://ref.ly/Heb7:11-Heb7:28)).
* In Hebrews, the term perfect means *complete* or *mature* (see [2:10](https://ref.ly/Heb2:10); [5:9](https://ref.ly/Heb5:9); [7:11](https://ref.ly/Heb7:11); [9:9–11](https://ref.ly/Heb9:9-Heb9:11)); the Son, through his sacrificial death and resurrection, has become completely qualified to serve as our eternal High Priest, and his priesthood lasts forever.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 7:28

## Hebrews 8:1–2 (id: 13319)

* The first two verses of chapter [8](https://ref.ly/Heb8:1-Heb8:13) connect the previous discussion and introduce the next topic.
* The main point is that Jesus is appointed as a superior high priest ([Hebrews 5:1](https://ref.ly/Heb5:1-Heb5:10)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[10](https://ref.ly/Heb5:1-Heb5:10); [7:1](https://ref.ly/Heb7:1-Heb7:28)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[28](https://ref.ly/Heb7:1-Heb7:28)).
* He serves in the heavenly tabernacle (also in [8:5](https://ref.ly/Heb8:5)): This introduces the theme of Jesus’s superior offering, discussed in the rest of this section ([8:3–10:18](https://ref.ly/Heb8:3-Heb10:18)). Unlike the Levitical priests who served in an earthly tent or building, Jesus’s sacrifice is superior because he serves in the true place of worship, the very presence of God in heaven ([8:5](https://ref.ly/Heb8:5); [9:11](https://ref.ly/Heb9:11), [24](https://ref.ly/Heb9:24); [10:12](https://ref.ly/Heb10:12)).

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 8:1–HEB 8:2

## Hebrews 8:1–10.18 (id: 13318)

This passage explains that Jesus's role as the heavenly High Priest is better than the role of earthly priests.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 8:1–HEB 10:18

## Hebrews 8:3 (id: 13324)

* Every high priest must offer gifts and sacrifices. Since offering sacrifices is a general duty of priests, Jesus also needed to offer a sacrifice.
* This verse repeats what was mentioned in the first verse of the earlier discussion ([Hebrews 5:1](https://ref.ly/Heb5:1)), marking another important section in the book.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 8:3

## Hebrews 8:4 (id: 13325)

If Jesus were on earth, he would not be a priest under the old system (see [Hebrews 7:13](https://ref.ly/Heb7:13-Heb7:14)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[14](https://ref.ly/Heb7:13-Heb7:14)). However, Jesus is in heaven, making his priestly role unique and better than the priests of the old covenant ([8:5](https://ref.ly/Heb8:5); [9:11](https://ref.ly/Heb9:11), [24](https://ref.ly/Heb9:24); [10:12](https://ref.ly/Heb10:12)).

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 8:4

## Hebrews 8:5 (id: 13326)

*a copy and shadow*: The earthly place of worship was a copy of the real one in heaven. This is why God told Moses to follow the pattern (see [Exodus 25:40](https://ref.ly/Exod25:40); [26:30](https://ref.ly/Exod26:30); compare [Acts 7:44](https://ref.ly/Acts7:44)). Both Judaism and early Christianity talked about a heavenly temple in a heavenly Jerusalem, which would come to earth at the end of time (see [Revelation 21:2](https://ref.ly/Rev21:2)). Hebrews suggests that God showed Moses this heavenly place so he could build the earthly tabernacle. However, Jesus serves as high priest in the heavenly temple.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 8:5

## Hebrews 8:6 (id: 13327)

* *He mediates*: A mediator helps two parties reach an agreement. Christ's sacrifice created a covenant (agreement) between people and God.
* *the covenant He mediates is better*: See “The New Covenant” Theme Note. This covenant is better because it relies on better promises (see [Hebrews 8:7](https://ref.ly/Heb8:7-Heb8:13)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[13](https://ref.ly/Heb8:7-Heb8:13)).

## Hebrews 8:7 (id: 13329)

The first agreement, made at Mount Sinai, was not without faults. It was only part of God’s plan, because it did not overcome human weakness (see [Hebrews 7:11](https://ref.ly/Heb7:11-Heb7:28)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[28](https://ref.ly/Heb7:11-Heb7:28); [8:9](https://ref.ly/Heb8:9)).

Highlighting the new covenant's superiority supports the argument in [Hebrews 9:1](https://ref.ly/Heb9:1-Heb10:18)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[10:18](https://ref.ly/Heb9:1-Heb10:18) that the Son’s offering under the new covenant was better than the old covenant offerings.

* *I took them by the hand*: God rescued his people from Egypt, guiding them like a parent guides a child who cannot care for itself (see [Exodus 12–14](https://ref.ly/Exod12:1-Exod14:31)).
* *they did not abide by My covenant*: See [Hebrews 3:7](https://ref.ly/Heb3:7-Heb3:19)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[19](https://ref.ly/Heb3:7-Heb3:19); [Numbers 14:1](https://ref.ly/Num14:1-Num14:38)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[38](https://ref.ly/Num14:1-Num14:38); [Deuteronomy 9](https://ref.ly/Deut9:1-Deut9:29); [Psalms 106](https://ref.ly/Ps106:1-Ps106:48).
* *I disregarded them*: The covenant warned that if the people turned away, God would also turn away from them (see [Deuteronomy 28:15](https://ref.ly/Deut28:15-Deut28:68)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[68](https://ref.ly/Deut28:15-Deut28:68); [30:11](https://ref.ly/Deut30:11-Deut30:20)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[20](https://ref.ly/Deut30:11-Deut30:20); [1 Kings 8:22](https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:22-1Kgs8:53)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[53](https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:22-1Kgs8:53); [2 Chronicles 6:12](https://ref.ly/2Chr6:12-2Chr6:42)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[42](https://ref.ly/2Chr6:12-2Chr6:42)).

In the old covenant, people had to deeply understand the words of the law ([Deuteronomy 32:46](https://ref.ly/Deut32:46)). The kings of Israel and Judah were judged on their dedication to God's law ([2 Kings 10:31](https://ref.ly/2Kgs10:31); [2 Chronicles 31:21](https://ref.ly/2Chr31:21)). Under the new covenant, God's laws are meant to be in people's minds and hearts. People would have renewed hearts and minds, with God's law as a natural, internal motivation.

A key feature of the new covenant is that God will forgive their wrongdoings and forget their sins.

This section explains that Christ's death, as the sacrifice in the new covenant, is better than the sacrifices in the old covenant.

Its exact location is unclear in the Old Testament, but it was closely linked to the Most Holy Place ([Exodus 30:6](https://ref.ly/Exod30:6); [Leviticus 16:13](https://ref.ly/Lev16:13); [1 Kings 6:22](https://ref.ly/1Kgs6:22)).
* The ark of the covenant, representing God's presence, was the most important item in the tabernacle (see [Exodus 25:10](https://ref.ly/Exod25:10-Exod25:22)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[22](https://ref.ly/Exod25:10-Exod25:22)).
* The gold jar with manna reminded people of God's provision in the wilderness ([Exodus 16:32](https://ref.ly/Exod16:32-Exod16:34)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[34](https://ref.ly/Exod16:32-Exod16:34)).
* Aaron’s staff, which sprouted leaves (see [Numbers 17:1](https://ref.ly/Num17:1-Num17:11)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[11](https://ref.ly/Num17:1-Num17:11)), reminded people not to rebel against God's chosen leaders ([Numbers 17:10](https://ref.ly/Num17:10); compare [Hebrews 13:17](https://ref.ly/Heb13:17)).
* The stone tablets of the covenant held the Ten Commandments and reminded the people of the rules they were to live by ([Exodus 25:16](https://ref.ly/Exod25:16); [31:18](https://ref.ly/Exod31:18); [Deuteronomy 9:9–10:5](https://ref.ly/Deut9:9-Deut10:5)).

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 9:4

## Hebrews 9:5 (id: 13354)

* The cherubim of divine glory were angel statues on the cover of the ark. These angels are closely linked to God's glorious presence ([Genesis 3:24](https://ref.ly/Gen3:24); [Psalms 80:1](https://ref.ly/Ps80:1); [99:1](https://ref.ly/Ps99:1); [Isaiah 37:16](https://ref.ly/Isa37:16)). The ark's cover was the atonement place, where they sprinkled blood from the Day of Atonement sacrifice ([Leviticus 16:14–16](https://ref.ly/Lev16:14-Lev16:16)).
* *we cannot discuss these things in detail now*: The main topic is the offering of sacrifices under the old covenant ([Hebrews 9:6](https://ref.ly/Heb9:6-Heb9:10)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[10](https://ref.ly/Heb9:6-Heb9:10)).

## Hebrews 9:6–8 (id: 13355)

In the Holy Place, which was the first room of the tabernacle ([Hebrews 9:2](https://ref.ly/Heb9:2)), priests had specific duties. They kept the lamps burning and replaced the sacred loaves of bread regularly ([Exodus 27:20](https://ref.ly/Exod27:20-Exod27:21)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[21](https://ref.ly/Exod27:20-Exod27:21); [Leviticus 24:8](https://ref.ly/Lev24:8)).

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 9:6–HEB 9:8

## Hebrews 9:7 (id: 13356)

Each year on the Day of Atonement, the high priest offered sacrifices for sins not covered by other sacrifices from the past year ([Leviticus 16:1](https://ref.ly/Lev16:1-Lev16:25)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[25](https://ref.ly/Lev16:1-Lev16:25)).

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 9:7

## Hebrews 9:8 (id: 13357)

* *had not yet been disclosed*: Under the old covenant system, people could not freely enter God's presence.
* The outer room of the tabernacle, which served as a sacred barrier, kept people from entering the Most Holy Place. This barrier symbolized the entire system, which kept people away from God's presence instead of guiding them into it.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 9:8

## Hebrews 9:9 (id: 13358)

This example shows that the gifts and sacrifices of the old covenant could not clear people's consciences. They could not remove guilt before a holy God (see [9:14](https://ref.ly/Heb9:14); [10:2](https://ref.ly/Heb10:2), [22](https://ref.ly/Heb10:22); [13:18](https://ref.ly/Heb13:18)).

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 9:9

## Hebrews 9:10 (id: 13334)

The old system focused only on physical rules and could not address people's inner feelings ([Hebrews 8:10](https://ref.ly/Heb8:10); [10:21](https://ref.ly/Heb10:21-Heb10:24)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[24](https://ref.ly/Heb10:21-Heb10:24)). It was temporary, meant to last until Christ came to create a better system ([9:11–10:18](https://ref.ly/Heb9:11-Heb10:18)).

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 9:10

## Hebrews 9:11 (id: 13336)

* Christ is now the high priest over all the good things of the new covenant. God appointed him, as mentioned in [Psalm 110:4](https://ref.ly/Ps110:4) ([Hebrews 5:1](https://ref.ly/Heb5:1-Heb5:10)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[10](https://ref.ly/Heb5:1-Heb5:10); [7:1](https://ref.ly/Heb7:1-Heb7:28)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[28](https://ref.ly/Heb7:1-Heb7:28)), and he offered a better sacrifice.
* *that have come*: Some manuscripts say *that are about to come,* either from the old covenant's viewpoint or looking forward to God's future plan.
* Christ’s sacrifice is better because it was made in the greater, perfect tabernacle in heaven, not the earthly one (see [8:5](https://ref.ly/Heb8:5) and corresponding study note).

## Hebrews 9:11–10.18 (id: 13335)

The author compares the old system ([Hebrews 9:1](https://ref.ly/Heb9:1-Heb9:10)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[10](https://ref.ly/Heb9:1-Heb9:10)) with Christ's superior sacrifice as high priest. Christ offered his own blood, not animal blood ([9:13](https://ref.ly/Heb9:13-Heb9:22)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[22](https://ref.ly/Heb9:13-Heb9:22); see also [9:7](https://ref.ly/Heb9:7)). His offering took place in the heavenly tabernacle, not the earthly one ([9:23](https://ref.ly/Heb9:23-Heb9:24)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[24](https://ref.ly/Heb9:23-Heb9:24); see also [9:1](https://ref.ly/Heb9:1-Heb9:5)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[5](https://ref.ly/Heb9:1-Heb9:5)). Unlike repeated offerings, Christ's sacrifice happened only once ([9:25–10:18](https://ref.ly/Heb9:25-Heb10:18); see also [7:27](https://ref.ly/Heb7:27); [9:6](https://ref.ly/Heb9:6-Heb9:7)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[7](https://ref.ly/Heb9:6-Heb9:7)).

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 9:11–HEB 10:18

## Hebrews 9:12 (id: 13337)

* Christ's offering is better because he used his own blood, not the blood of goats and calves (see [Leviticus 16:3](https://ref.ly/Lev16:3-Lev16:5)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[5](https://ref.ly/Lev16:3-Lev16:5)).
* Christ's offering is better because he entered the Most Holy Place once for all time. Unlike the sacrifices in the old covenant, which had to be repeated every year ([Hebrews 10:1](https://ref.ly/Heb10:1)), Jesus's sacrificial death was needed only once and secured our redemption forever.

## Hebrews 9:13 (id: 13338)

The ashes of a young cow were mixed with water to purify people from ceremonial impurity (see [Numbers 19](https://ref.ly/Num19:1-Num19:22)).

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 9:13

## Hebrews 9:14 (id: 13339)

* *how much more*: This is an argument from lesser to greater, a traditional Jewish way of reasoning. The idea is that if something is true in a smaller case, it is even more true in a bigger case (see also [Hebrews 2:1–4](https://ref.ly/Heb2:1-Heb2:4); [12:25](https://ref.ly/Heb12:25-Heb12:29)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[29](https://ref.ly/Heb12:25-Heb12:29)). If animal blood had some effect in cleansing, then Christ's blood will be much more effective.
* *purify our consciences*: Christ’s sacrifice, unlike the old covenant sacrifices, removes the guilt that keeps us from God by thoroughly cleansing us from sinful actions.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 9:14

## Hebrews 9:15 (id: 13340)

*the mediator*: This term describes a person who helps resolve a tough legal or political disagreement. In the old covenant, people saw Moses and the angels as go\-betweens between God and the people ([Galatians 3:19](https://ref.ly/Gal3:19-Gal3:20)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[20](https://ref.ly/Gal3:19-Gal3:20)). In the new covenant, Christ connects God and people through his sacrificial death ([Hebrews 8:6](https://ref.ly/Heb8:6); [12:24](https://ref.ly/Heb12:24); [Romans 6:23](https://ref.ly/Rom6:23); [1 Timothy 2:5](https://ref.ly/1Tim2:5); [1 Peter 3:18](https://ref.ly/1Pet3:18)) and ongoing intercession (prayer on behalf of others) ([Hebrews 7:25](https://ref.ly/Heb7:25)).

He then discusses it further, using the start of the first covenant as an example ([9:18](https://ref.ly/Heb9:18-Heb9:22)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[22](https://ref.ly/Heb9:18-Heb9:22)).

* Hebrews is the only ancient source that says Moses sprinkled the book of God's law (see [Exodus 24:6](https://ref.ly/Exod24:6-Exod24:8)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[8](https://ref.ly/Exod24:6-Exod24:8)).
* Hyssop branches have blue flowers and strong\-smelling leaves. People used them with sacrifices for cleansing ([Exodus 12:22](https://ref.ly/Exod12:22); [Leviticus 14:4](https://ref.ly/Lev14:4); [Numbers 19:6](https://ref.ly/Num19:6), [18](https://ref.ly/Num19:18)).

## Hebrews 9:22 (id: 13345)

In the law of Moses, many cleansing rituals required the death of a sacrificial animal. Blood was used in these cleansing rituals (see [Exodus 29:12](https://ref.ly/Exod29:12); [30:10](https://ref.ly/Exod30:10); [Leviticus 4:6](https://ref.ly/Lev4:6), [17](https://ref.ly/Lev4:17); [16:14](https://ref.ly/Lev16:14-Lev16:19)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[19](https://ref.ly/Lev16:14-Lev16:19); [Numbers 19:4](https://ref.ly/Num19:4)) and for making atonement (see [Leviticus 16](https://ref.ly/Lev16:1-Lev16:34)). The shedding of Christ’s blood created the new covenant, offering lasting purification and complete forgiveness of sins ([Hebrews 8:12](https://ref.ly/Heb8:12); [10:15–18](https://ref.ly/Heb10:15-Heb10:18); [Matthew 26:28](https://ref.ly/Matt26:28); [Ephesians 1:7](https://ref.ly/Eph1:7)).

## Hebrews 9:23 (id: 13346)

* This verse uses a comparison from lesser to greater (see study note on Hebrews 9:14). Just as heaven is greater than the earthly tabernacle, Christ’s sacrifice had to be much better than earthly sacrifices.

* *copies of the heavenly things*: See study note on Hebrews 8:5.
* *heavenly things to be purified*: Just as the tabernacle needed cleansing because of the Israelites' sin ([Leviticus 16:16](https://ref.ly/Lev16:16-Lev16:19)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[19](https://ref.ly/Lev16:16-Lev16:19)), the heavenly tabernacle required removing uncleanness from those entering heaven under the new covenant.

## Hebrews 9:24 (id: 13347)

Under the new covenant, Christ did not offer his sacrifice in the earthly tabernacle. Instead, he entered God's presence in heaven to act for us. His sacrifice makes him a better mediator to help us have a right relationship with God ([2 Corinthians 5:19](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:19-2Cor5:21)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[21](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:19-2Cor5:21)).

## Hebrews 9:25–26 (id: 13348)

Under the old covenant, the priests had to repeat the sacrifice on the Day of Atonement every year ([Leviticus 16:29](https://ref.ly/Lev16:29-Lev16:34)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[34](https://ref.ly/Lev16:29-Lev16:34)). Christ's better sacrifice was made once and for all time.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 9:25–HEB 9:26

## Hebrews 9:26 (id: 13349)

*Otherwise*: The author uses a logical argument to show that Christ’s one sacrifice is permanently effective. Christ is both the sacrifice and the high priest. If his offering had to be repeated every year, like the earthly priests, he would have to die again and again. But that idea is absurd. Clearly, Christ died once for all time to take away sin.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 9:26

## Hebrews 9:27–28 (id: 13350)

Christ's first coming was to remove the sins of many people. When he comes again*,* it will not be to address sins, as that is already done. Instead, he will bring salvation to everyone eagerly waiting for him (see study note on Galatians 5:5).

## Hebrews 10:1 (id: 13097)

The old system under the law of Moses (literally *the law*), like the tabernacle itself ([Hebrews 8:5](https://ref.ly/Heb8:5)), was just a shadow, a dim preview of a greater reality—the good things that Christ started in the new covenant. Under the old covenant, sacrifices had to be repeated many times because they could not permanently cleanse worshipers or allow them to be in God's presence forever.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 10:1

## Hebrews 10:2 (id: 13107)

* The ongoing sacrifices show they were not enough. If the old covenant sacrifices had provided lasting purity, they would have ended.
* Their guilt would have disappeared: See [Hebrews 9:9](https://ref.ly/Heb9:9), [14](https://ref.ly/Heb9:14); [10:22](https://ref.ly/Heb10:22); [13:18](https://ref.ly/Heb13:18).

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 10:2

## Hebrews 10:3 (id: 13116)

Instead of removing guilt, the ongoing sacrifices actually reminded those who wished to come near to God, year after year*,* that they were guilty before God.

## Hebrews 10:4 (id: 13117)

The sacrifices of bulls and goats in the old covenant provided some cleansing ([Hebrews 9:13](https://ref.ly/Heb9:13), [23](https://ref.ly/Heb9:23)), but it was limited. They could not remove sins completely. These sacrifices could not permanently cleanse or bring lasting peace with God (see [Acts 10:36](https://ref.ly/Acts10:36); [Romans 5:1](https://ref.ly/Rom5:1); [11:26](https://ref.ly/Rom11:26-Rom11:27)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22)[27](https://ref.ly/Rom11:26-Rom11:27)).

## Hebrews 10:5 (id: 13119)

*but a body You prepared for Me*: God had prepared the psalm writer to obey and be ready to do God's will. Hebrews now applies this idea to Christ. For Hebrews, preparing a human *body*, especially Christ's body, shows that God would use it as a better sacrifice.

[Psalm 40](https://ref.ly/Ps40:1-Ps40:17) is a song praising God, where the writer expresses a wish to follow God's will. The author of Hebrews sees Christ as the one speaking.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 10:5–HEB 10:7

## Hebrews 10:8–10 (id: 13120)

* The author of Hebrews carefully follows the order of thought in the psalm.
* *In the passage above He says,* *"**Sacrifices and offerings, burnt offerings and sin offerings You did not desire…**"*: The author of Hebrews sees this as God rejecting the old system of sacrifices.
* *Then He adds, “Here I am, I have come to do Your will.”*: The author of Hebrews interprets this as Christ's willingness to be the ultimate sacrifice for sins.
* The author of Hebrews concludes that because of Christ’s sacrifice, God has canceled the first covenant. God’s plan, as shown by [Psalm 40:6–8](https://ref.ly/Ps40:6-Ps40:8), was for Christ to die for sins as a sacrifice, and this only needed to happen once for all time.

## Hebrews 10:12–13 (id: 13091)

* Christ’s sacrifice was different from that of the earthly high priests. He offered himself to God, rather than offering animal sacrifices.
* After his sacrifice, Christ sat in a place of honor (see [Psalm 110:1](https://ref.ly/Ps110:1)). Unlike the old covenant priests who stood daily ([Hebrews 10:11](https://ref.ly/Heb10:11)), he waits until his enemies are humbled and become a footstool under his feet ([Psalm 110:1](https://ref.ly/Ps110:1)).

## Hebrews 10:15–17 (id: 13093)

* The author again quotes from [Jeremiah 31:33–34](https://ref.ly/Jer31:33-Jer31:34) (see [Hebrews 8:7–12](https://ref.ly/Heb8:7-Heb8:12)) to support the statement in [10:14](https://ref.ly/Heb10:14). This shows that Christ’s one sacrifice under the new covenant has made worshipers perfect forever.
* God’s laws have now been placed in their hearts and on their minds. This means that a believer’s relationship with God is now inward, not just outward.
* *Their sins and lawless acts I will remember no more*: As the author has shown in [9:11–10:14](https://ref.ly/Heb9:11-Heb10:14), this is possible only because Christ’s sacrifice is greater than all others.

When God completely and permanently forgives sins ([Hebrews 10:1](https://ref.ly/Heb10:1-Heb10:4)[–](https://ref.ly/Ps40:6-Ps40:8)[4](https://ref.ly/Heb10:1-Heb10:4), [11](https://ref.ly/Heb10:11)), there is no need for more sacrifices.

* *sincere heart*: Under the new covenant, believers have changed hearts ([Hebrews 8:10](https://ref.ly/Heb8:10); [10:16](https://ref.ly/Heb10:16); [Jer 31:31](https://ref.ly/Jer31:31-Jer31:34)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb9:1-Heb9:5)[34](https://ref.ly/Jer31:31-Jer31:34)).
* *in full assurance of faith*: Christ's actions for us give us confidence that God will welcome us.
* *having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience*: Christ's sacrificial death has completely cleansed us from sin (see [9:13](https://ref.ly/Heb9:13-Heb9:14)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb9:1-Heb9:5)[14](https://ref.ly/Heb9:13-Heb9:14), [19](https://ref.ly/Heb9:19-Heb9:23)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb9:1-Heb9:5)[23](https://ref.ly/Heb9:19-Heb9:23)).

## Hebrews 10:24 (id: 13102)

True Christian commitment is shown through acts of love and good deeds ([Hebrews 6:10](https://ref.ly/Heb6:10); [10:32](https://ref.ly/Heb10:32-Heb10:34)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb9:1-Heb9:5)[34](https://ref.ly/Heb10:32-Heb10:34); [Galatians 5:13](https://ref.ly/Gal5:13); [1 Thessalonians 1:3](https://ref.ly/1Thess1:3); [Revelation 2:19](https://ref.ly/Rev2:19)).

## Hebrews 10:25 (id: 13103)

* Some people in this Christian community had started to skip their regular worship meetings, possibly to avoid persecution ([Hebrews 10:32](https://ref.ly/Heb10:32-Heb10:39)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb9:1-Heb9:5)[39](https://ref.ly/Heb10:32-Heb10:39)).
* We should encourage each other to love and do good deeds, keeping in mind the day of Christ’s return, his second coming ([9:28](https://ref.ly/Heb9:28); [Luke 12:42](https://ref.ly/Luke12:42-Luke12:46)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb9:1-Heb9:5)[46](https://ref.ly/Luke12:42-Luke12:46); [1 Corinthians 5:5](https://ref.ly/1Cor5:5); [1 Thessalonians 5:2](https://ref.ly/1Thess5:2); [2 Peter 3:10](https://ref.ly/2Pet3:10); [1 John 2:28](https://ref.ly/1John2:28)).

## Hebrews 10:26–27 (id: 13104)

*deliberately*: Open rebellion against God's laws was called "sinning with a high hand" (see study note on Numbers 15:30[–](https://ref.ly/Heb9:1-Heb9:5)31). Here, the author refers to rejecting Christ and his work. Christ's sacrifice for sins ended the old covenant's sacrificial system ([Hebrews 9:11–10:18](https://ref.ly/Heb9:11-Heb10:18)). If someone rejects the Son's sacrifice, there is no other sacrifice for forgiveness. A person who rejects Christ can only expect judgment as one of God's enemies (compare [Isaiah 26:10](https://ref.ly/Isa26:10-Isa26:11)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb9:1-Heb9:5)[11](https://ref.ly/Isa26:10-Isa26:11)).

The author gives a strong warning about the danger of rejecting God's Son and his message. This warning urges listeners to commit to following Christ.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 10:26–HEB 10:31

## Hebrews 10:28–29 (id: 13106)

* The author compares two situations, one less severe and one more severe (see study note on Hebrews 9:14). The less severe situation is the old punishment of death for someone who refused to follow the law of Moses (see [Deuteronomy 13:6](https://ref.ly/Deut13:6-Deut13:11)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb9:1-Heb9:5)[11](https://ref.ly/Deut13:6-Deut13:11)). The more severe situation involves those who reject Christ and show him disrespect.
* *How much more severely do you think one deserves to be punished*: Eternal damnation awaits those who have rejected Christ.
* The blood of the covenant, which made us holy, is Christ’s perfect sacrifice ([9:11–10:18](https://ref.ly/Heb9:11-Heb10:18)).
* *insulted the Spirit of grace*: Those who reject the Spirit’s guidance and mercy deny the truth of the good news and the greatness of Christ and his saving work (compare [Mark 3:22](https://ref.ly/Mark3:22-Mark3:30)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb9:1-Heb9:5)[30](https://ref.ly/Mark3:22-Mark3:30)).

* *“The Lord will judge His people”*: [Deuteronomy 32:36](https://ref.ly/Deut32:36); compare [1 Peter 4:17](https://ref.ly/1Pet4:17-1Pet4:18)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb9:1-Heb9:5)[18](https://ref.ly/1Pet4:17-1Pet4:18).
* That God *will repay them* and *will judge His people* shows how serious the situation is for those who have rejected Christ. Once God decides to judge someone, no one can save that person from God's hand ([Deuteronomy 32:39](https://ref.ly/Deut32:39)).

## Hebrews 10:32 (id: 13110)

*the early days that you were in the light*: The author reminds his audience about the early days after they believed in Christ. During that time, their faith was tested. Even when they suffered greatly, they stayed faithful. Suffering is normal for someone who identifies with Christ and his community (see [13:12–13](https://ref.ly/Heb13:12-Heb13:13); [Acts 9:16](https://ref.ly/Acts9:16); [Romans 8:17](https://ref.ly/Rom8:17); [1 Corinthians 4:12–13](https://ref.ly/1Cor4:12-1Cor4:13); [Philippians 1:29](https://ref.ly/Phil1:29); [James 1:2–4](https://ref.ly/Jas1:2-Jas1:4)).

## Hebrews 10:34 (id: 13112)

* Those who were put in jail depended on friends and family for basic needs (see [Hebrews 13:3](https://ref.ly/Heb13:3)).
* *the confiscation of your property*: The Roman government sometimes forced people out of their homes and cities (see [Acts 18:2](https://ref.ly/Acts18:2-Acts18:3)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb9:1-Heb9:5)[3](https://ref.ly/Acts18:2-Acts18:3)). These Christians had experienced this persecution before and accepted it with joy (see [Romans 5:3](https://ref.ly/Rom5:3); [James 1:2](https://ref.ly/Jas1:2-Jas1:4)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb9:1-Heb9:5)[4](https://ref.ly/Jas1:2-Jas1:4); [1 Peter 1:6](https://ref.ly/1Pet1:6)). They looked forward to better things that will last forever (see [Hebrews 11:35](https://ref.ly/Heb11:35)). God promises rewards to those who stay faithful.

## Hebrews 10:35–36 (id: 13113)

Because of their strong faith in the past ([Hebrews 10:32](https://ref.ly/Heb10:32-Heb10:34)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb9:1-Heb9:5)[34](https://ref.ly/Heb10:32-Heb10:34)), the author encourages them not to lose their trust in the Lord. The term translated as *confidence* also refers to *boldness* when approaching God ([4:16](https://ref.ly/Heb4:16); [10:19](https://ref.ly/Heb10:19); see also [3:6](https://ref.ly/Heb3:6)). Those who stay faithful will receive a great reward (see [1:14](https://ref.ly/Heb1:14); [6:12](https://ref.ly/Heb6:12); [9:15](https://ref.ly/Heb9:15); [James 1:12](https://ref.ly/Jas1:12)).

## Hebrews 11:1–40 (id: 13121)

Chapter [11](https://ref.ly/Heb11:1-Heb11:40) gives a long list of people who trusted God. This shows clearly that living by faith is the only true way to follow God. The writer keeps repeating the words “by faith” to make this message clear. Each example follows the same pattern:

* (a) the phrase *by faith,*
* (b) the person's name,
* (c) the event or action showing faith, and
* (d) the result.

## Hebrews 11:4 (id: 13151)

* *Abel*: See [Genesis 4:3](https://ref.ly/Gen4:3-Gen4:5)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb9:1-Heb9:5)[5](https://ref.ly/Gen4:3-Gen4:5).
* *By faith he was commended as righteous**:* Compare with [Hebrews 10:38](https://ref.ly/Heb10:38).

* *without faith it is impossible to please God*: The author refers to [Hebrews 10:38](https://ref.ly/Heb10:38), which quotes [Habakkuk 2:4](https://ref.ly/Hab2:4).
* Faith must include believing that God exists and that he rewards those who sincerely seek him. When life is difficult, listeners are encouraged to trust God and expect him to fulfill his promises.

## Hebrews 11:7 (id: 13154)

* The story of Noah (see [Genesis 6:1–9:17](https://ref.ly/Gen6:1-Gen9:17)) shows that faith means obeying even when you cannot see the outcome.

The only part of the story that could be seen as a blessing for Esau is that he would eventually break free from serving his brother. Later, Esau received blessings through Jacob's wealth ([Genesis 33:8](https://ref.ly/Gen33:8-Gen33:11)[–](https://ref.ly/Gen22:1-Gen22:18)[11](https://ref.ly/Gen33:8-Gen33:11)).

The rescue through the Red Sea (see [Exodus 13:17–14:21](https://ref.ly/Exod13:17-Exod14:21)) is the greatest moment of deliverance in Israel’s history. The people's fear and complaints at the time ([Exodus 14:10](https://ref.ly/Exod14:10-Exod14:12)[–](https://ref.ly/Gen22:1-Gen22:18)[12](https://ref.ly/Exod14:10-Exod14:12)) do not clearly show faith, but they moved forward when instructed, despite their fear.

Rahab, a prostitute ([Joshua 2](https://ref.ly/Josh2:1-Josh2:24); [6:25](https://ref.ly/Josh6:25)), showed faith in the God of Israel by hiding the spies who visited her home (see [James 2:25](https://ref.ly/Jas2:25)). Because of this, she and her family were spared and became part of the Israelite community. Rahab was even an ancestor of Jesus ([Matthew 1:5](https://ref.ly/Matt1:5)).

        + Samson, despite his moral weaknesses, was used by God to fight the Philistines for Israel ([Judges 13–16](https://ref.ly/Judg13:1-Judg16:31)).
        + Jephthah achieved victory over the Amorites and Ammonites ([Judges 10:6–12:7](https://ref.ly/Judg10:6-Judg12:7)).
        + David, the only king in the group, loved God and generally led a life of faith ([1 Samuel 16—1 Kings 1](https://ref.ly/1Sam16:1-1Kgs1:53)).
        + Samuel was a key leader between the time of the judges and Israel's first kings. He listened to God's voice and followed his will ([1 Samuel 1–15](https://ref.ly/1Sam1:1-1Sam15:35)).
* The phrase *and the prophets* includes Elijah, Elisha, and the prophets from Isaiah to Malachi. These prophets often showed great faith despite facing hostility.

## Hebrews 11:32–40 (id: 13142)

The author quickly highlights other faithful people from the old covenant era. In [Hebrews 11:32](https://ref.ly/Heb11:32-Heb11:35)[–](https://ref.ly/Judg7:7-Judg7:25)[35a](https://ref.ly/Heb11:32-Heb11:35), faith leads to rescue and triumph. In [11:35b](https://ref.ly/Heb11:35-Heb11:38)[–](https://ref.ly/Judg7:7-Judg7:25)[38](https://ref.ly/Heb11:35-Heb11:38), however, faith results in harsh persecution and even death for their beliefs. Despite these outcomes, God honored both groups with a good reputation because of their faith ([11:39](https://ref.ly/Heb11:39)).

* *Others were tortured*: Faith does not always lead to a positive outcome in this life. The author might be referring to the 170s and 160s BC, when many Jews suffered and died rather than abandon their faith (see, for example, 1 Maccabees1:20[–](https://ref.ly/Judg7:7-Judg7:25)64\).

## Hebrews 12:1–17 (id: 13157)

The author encourages listeners to keep following Jesus, who is the ultimate example of faithfulness. They should:

* imitate him in his suffering ([Hebrews 12:1](https://ref.ly/Heb12:1-Heb12:4)[–](https://ref.ly/Judg7:7-Judg7:25)[4](https://ref.ly/Heb12:1-Heb12:4)),

## Hebrews 12:2 (id: 13175)

* Jesus is the ultimate example of staying faithful ([Hebrews 3:1](https://ref.ly/Heb3:1)). To endure in the Christian life, we must focus on Jesus and his work for us.
* *Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith*: Jesus has done everything needed for faith to be real under the new covenant.
* *scorning its shame*: Crucifixion (dying on a cross) was the most shameful way to execute someone. It was used to humiliate and torture the person crucified. It was used only for slaves and criminals who were not Roman citizens. Christ ignored that shame.
* *sat down at the right hand of the throne of God*: The author refers again to [Psalm 110:1](https://ref.ly/Ps110:1) (see also [Hebrews 1:3](https://ref.ly/Heb1:3), [13](https://ref.ly/Heb1:13); [8:1](https://ref.ly/Heb8:1); [10:12](https://ref.ly/Heb10:12)).

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 12:2

## Hebrews 12:3 (id: 13176)

Think of all the hostility he endured from sinful people. The recipients of Hebrews were tired and ready to give up. They were emotionally worn out due to the persecution they faced. To endure, they needed to focus on Jesus, who had faced even greater hostility.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 12:3

## Hebrews 12:4 (id: 13177)

*not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood*: This community had not yet faced dying for their faith. (This is one reason to date Hebrews before Nero's persecution in the mid\-60s AD.) If Jesus could endure a shameful death, the listeners should handle less severe persecution.

God can use many trials and challenges for our benefit, teaching us righteousness and good character.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 12:5–HEB 12:6

## Hebrews 12:7–8 (id: 13179)

*discipline … God is treating you as sons*: Fathers in Greco\-Roman and Jewish families played a key role in raising their children. They believed discipline was essential for preparing children for adulthood. Fatherly discipline, in this case facing hardships in life, is a sign of legitimate relationship. Not having to face hardships may on the surface seem like a blessing, but might instead reflect a lack of genuine relationship. 

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 12:7–HEB 12:8

## Hebrews 12:9 (id: 13180)

The author uses a comparison from lesser to greater (see study note on Hebrews 9:14). The lesser situation is the respect given to an earthly father during discipline. We should submit even more to the discipline of the Father of our spirits in our relationship with God. We should be open to God like a good Father, trusting that he helps us grow, even through tough times.

## Hebrews 12:10–11 (id: 13158)

There are at least two limits to a father's discipline:

1. His discipline or education lasts only a few years—children eventually leave home.
2. Fathers do their best with limited understanding.

In contrast, God's discipline lasts a lifetime and is always beneficial, based on his infinite knowledge and love. His goal is for us to share in his holiness. Although discipline is painful, it leads to a peaceful life of doing right. It helps God's children build harmonious relationships and make good choices (see also [Romans 5:3](https://ref.ly/Rom5:3-Rom5:4)[–](https://ref.ly/Judg7:7-Judg7:25)[4](https://ref.ly/Rom5:3-Rom5:4); [8:17](https://ref.ly/Rom8:17), [28](https://ref.ly/Rom8:28); [2 Corinthians 4:17](https://ref.ly/2Cor4:17); [Philippians 1:12](https://ref.ly/Phil1:12-Phil1:14)[–](https://ref.ly/Judg7:7-Judg7:25)[14](https://ref.ly/Phil1:12-Phil1:14); [James 1:2](https://ref.ly/Jas1:2-Jas1:4)[–](https://ref.ly/Judg7:7-Judg7:25)[4](https://ref.ly/Jas1:2-Jas1:4); [1 Peter 1:7](https://ref.ly/1Pet1:7); [4:14](https://ref.ly/1Pet4:14)).

* Esau showed disrespect for his birthright ([Genesis 25:29–34](https://ref.ly/Gen25:29-Gen25:34)), which is why he was considered godless. His choice to trade God's blessings for immediate fulfillment shows a lack of faith.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 12:16

## Hebrews 12:17 (id: 13163)

The author of Hebrews views Esau's lack of respect for his inheritance ([Hebrews 12:16](https://ref.ly/Heb12:16)) and his loss of the blessing ([Genesis 27:30](https://ref.ly/Gen27:30-Gen27:40)[–](https://ref.ly/Gen25:29-Gen25:34)[40](https://ref.ly/Gen27:30-Gen27:40)) as closely connected.

It was impersonal, frightening, and unapproachable. The mountain shook with loud sounds, flashes of light, and fearful power. The new covenant is represented by Mount Zion ([12:22](https://ref.ly/Heb12:22-Heb12:24)[–](https://ref.ly/Gen25:29-Gen25:34)[24](https://ref.ly/Heb12:22-Heb12:24)).

* The word translated as *assembly* is usually translated "church." It refers to God's gathered people.

* The idea that God's people have their names written in heaven shows God's special care for them (see also [Exodus 32:32](https://ref.ly/Exod32:32); [Psalm 69:28](https://ref.ly/Ps69:28); [Isaiah 4:3](https://ref.ly/Isa4:3); [Daniel 12:1](https://ref.ly/Dan12:1); [Luke 10:20](https://ref.ly/Luke10:20); [Philippians 4:3](https://ref.ly/Phil4:3); [Revelation 3:5](https://ref.ly/Rev3:5)).
* For God's children, God as judge is the one who defends them (see [Psalms 9:8](https://ref.ly/Ps9:8); [58:11](https://ref.ly/Ps58:11); [94:2](https://ref.ly/Ps94:2); [Isaiah 11:4](https://ref.ly/Isa11:4); [Jeremiah 22:16](https://ref.ly/Jer22:16)).

His sprinkled blood, used as the sacrifice for sins, represents forgiveness.
* Abel's blood cried out to God from the ground, seeking justice for his murder by Cain ([Genesis 4:10](https://ref.ly/Gen4:10)). In contrast, the blood of Jesus declares that the price for sins is paid for those in the new covenant ([Hebrews 10:16](https://ref.ly/Heb10:16-Heb10:18)[–](https://ref.ly/Gen25:29-Gen25:34)[18](https://ref.ly/Heb10:16-Heb10:18)).

1. Moses warning people under the old covenant is less serious.
2. God's warning from heaven is more serious.

If people did not avoid judgment when warned by Moses, those who reject the message of God's Son will definitely not avoid punishment.

God's promises remain true: “Never will I leave you, never will I forsake you” (see [Deuteronomy 31:6](https://ref.ly/Deut31:6), [8](https://ref.ly/Deut31:8)).

## Hebrews 13:6 (id: 13199)

This quote from [Psalm 118:6](https://ref.ly/Ps118:6) shows a response of faith: The Lord is my helper*,* so we do not need to fear what others might do.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 13:6

## Hebrews 13:7 (id: 13201)

*Remember your leaders*: The word *leaders* referred to military, political, and religious figures. These leaders, likely founders of this community, taught the word of God to them, which is a basic duty of those who lead (see [1 Timothy 3:2](https://ref.ly/1Tim3:2); [2 Timothy 2:15](https://ref.ly/2Tim2:15); [Titus 1:9](https://ref.ly/Titus1:9)). Their lives and faith were examples to follow.

## Hebrews 13:7–19 (id: 13200)

This middle part of chapter 13 is framed by mentions of the community's leaders ([13:7](https://ref.ly/Heb13:7), [17–19](https://ref.ly/Heb13:17-Heb13:19)). Rabbis often used a technique called *inclusio*, where similar words or phrases mark the start and end of a section, like a subheading in a modern book. This part suggests there were several challenges in the church that the book of Hebrews originally addressed.

## Hebrews 13:8 (id: 13202)

* Even though the community faced new challenges, Jesus Christ remains the same, and his good news does not change.
* *yesterday*: Jesus was the Father's agent in creation ([Hebrews 1:2](https://ref.ly/Heb1:2), [10](https://ref.ly/Heb1:10)).
* *today*: Jesus sits at the Father's right hand ([1:13](https://ref.ly/Heb1:13); [7:26](https://ref.ly/Heb7:26-Heb7:28)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb13:17-Heb13:19)[28](https://ref.ly/Heb7:26-Heb7:28); [10:12](https://ref.ly/Heb10:12)). He will rule the universe forever ([1:8](https://ref.ly/Heb1:8), [10](https://ref.ly/Heb1:10-Heb1:12)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb13:17-Heb13:19)[12](https://ref.ly/Heb1:10-Heb1:12)).

## Hebrews 13:9–10 (id: 13203)

Since Jesus does not change ([Hebrews 13:8](https://ref.ly/Heb13:8)), believers should avoid being drawn to strange, new ideas. The false teachings mentioned involved rules about food. In some parts of Judaism, certain ritual meals were thought to provide God's grace to participants. Some in the community might have been tempted to leave the Christian community to join Jewish fellowship meals. These Jewish meals sometimes encouraged participants to focus on the Jerusalem altar. The author reminds listeners that we have an altar that those under the old covenant cannot access—Christ’s sacrifice ([7:27](https://ref.ly/Heb7:27-Heb7:28)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb13:17-Heb13:19)[28](https://ref.ly/Heb7:27-Heb7:28); [8:13](https://ref.ly/Heb8:13); [9:11](https://ref.ly/Heb9:11-Heb9:14)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb13:17-Heb13:19)[14](https://ref.ly/Heb9:11-Heb9:14); [10:11](https://ref.ly/Heb10:11-Heb10:14)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb13:17-Heb13:19)[14](https://ref.ly/Heb10:11-Heb10:14)).

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 13:9–HEB 13:10

## Hebrews 13:11–12 (id: 13182)

The author explains the sacrifice on the Day of Atonement ([Leviticus 16:1](https://ref.ly/Lev16:1-Lev16:28)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb13:17-Heb13:19)[28](https://ref.ly/Lev16:1-Lev16:28)), where animals were burned outside the camp ([Leviticus 16:27](https://ref.ly/Lev16:27)). Similarly, Jesus suffered and died outside Jerusalem's city gates. He was the ultimate Day of Atonement sacrifice ([Hebrews 9:11](https://ref.ly/Heb9:11-Heb9:14)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb13:17-Heb13:19)[14](https://ref.ly/Heb9:11-Heb9:14), [24](https://ref.ly/Heb9:24-Heb9:28)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb13:17-Heb13:19)[28](https://ref.ly/Heb9:24-Heb9:28); [10:1](https://ref.ly/Heb10:1-Heb10:4)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb13:17-Heb13:19)[4](https://ref.ly/Heb10:1-Heb10:4)).

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 13:11–HEB 13:12

## Hebrews 13:13 (id: 13183)

*let us go to Him outside the camp*: We should stand with Jesus, identify with him, and reject the false safety and comfort of siding with the world against him. By standing with Christ, we share in the disgrace he experienced ([Hebrews 6:5](https://ref.ly/Heb6:5-Heb6:6)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb13:17-Heb13:19)[6](https://ref.ly/Heb6:5-Heb6:6); [12:1](https://ref.ly/Heb12:1-Heb12:3)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb13:17-Heb13:19)[3](https://ref.ly/Heb12:1-Heb12:3)).

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 13:13

## Hebrews 13:14 (id: 13184)

Like Abraham's family ([Hebrews 11:9–16](https://ref.ly/Heb11:9-Heb11:16)), we do not see this world as our permanent home. We are waiting for our future home, the heavenly city of Jerusalem ([12:22](https://ref.ly/Heb12:22)).

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 13:14

## Hebrews 13:15 (id: 13186)

*sacrifice of praise*: This likely refers to a peace offering ([Leviticus 7:11–14](https://ref.ly/Lev7:11-Lev7:14)). The person bringing the offering needed to be ritually clean first. We can continually offer thanks to God because Jesus has made us clean forever. By giving thanks to Jesus all the time, we show our loyalty to his name.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 13:15

## Hebrews 13:15–16 (id: 13185)

Because of Jesus’s selfless work for us, believers still need to offer sacrifices such as praise and obedience. Christ ended the old covenant sacrifices when he gave himself as the final sacrifice ([Hebrews 7:27–28](https://ref.ly/Heb7:27-Heb7:28); [8:13](https://ref.ly/Heb8:13); [9:11](https://ref.ly/Heb9:11-Heb9:14)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:27-Heb7:28)[14](https://ref.ly/Heb9:11-Heb9:14); [10:11](https://ref.ly/Heb10:11-Heb10:14)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:27-Heb7:28)[14](https://ref.ly/Heb10:11-Heb10:14)). Now these spiritual sacrifices are the ones that please God.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 13:15–HEB 13:16

## Hebrews 13:16 (id: 13187)

Doing good and helping those in need are basic Christian sacrifices ([Hebrews 6:10](https://ref.ly/Heb6:10); [10:24](https://ref.ly/Heb10:24), [34](https://ref.ly/Heb10:34); [13:1](https://ref.ly/Heb13:1-Heb13:3)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:27-Heb7:28)[3](https://ref.ly/Heb13:1-Heb13:3)). These actions define life in the Christian community.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 13:16

## Hebrews 13:17 (id: 13188)

* The relationship between the church's spiritual leaders and its members might have been tense. The author encourages members to listen to and trust their leaders.
* The Greek word for *obey* can also mean *follow, place confidence in,* or *be persuaded by.*
* Christian leaders care for people's souls ([Acts 20:28](https://ref.ly/Acts20:28-Acts20:31)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:27-Heb7:28)[31](https://ref.ly/Acts20:28-Acts20:31); [1 Peter 5:1](https://ref.ly/1Pet5:1-1Pet5:4)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:27-Heb7:28)[4](https://ref.ly/1Pet5:1-1Pet5:4)), which is a serious responsibility. It makes them accountable to God ([James 3:1](https://ref.ly/Jas3:1)).
* The word *grief* could also mean *groaning.* It refers to emotional burden and stress. Leaders who are stressed and burdened by a difficult church are less able to help and lead the church effectively.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 13:17

## Hebrews 13:18–19 (id: 13189)

* *Pray for us*: The author requests prayers for himself using the "authorial plural" (a literary device where the author uses "we" instead of "I") (see also [5:11](https://ref.ly/Heb5:11); [6:9](https://ref.ly/Heb6:9)).
* *we have a clear conscience**:* Compare with [2 Corinthians 1:11](https://ref.ly/2Cor1:11-2Cor1:12)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb7:27-Heb7:28)[12](https://ref.ly/2Cor1:11-2Cor1:12); [4:2](https://ref.ly/2Cor4:2).

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 13:18–HEB 13:19

## Hebrews 13:20–21 (id: 13191)

* Benedictions, or closing blessings, were an important part of letters, speeches, and sermons. The author of Hebrews includes many of the book’s main themes in his benediction.
* The image of our Lord Jesus as the great Shepherd of the sheep (see [Psalm 23](https://ref.ly/Ps23:1-Ps23:6)) shows God's care and protection for his people (see also [John 10:11–18](https://ref.ly/John10:11-John10:18); [1 Peter 2:25](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:25)) and connects it to an eternal covenant.

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 13:20–HEB 13:21

## Hebrews 13:22 (id: 13192)

This short encouragement likely shows that Hebrews was a sermon (compare with the same term in [Acts 13:14–15](https://ref.ly/Acts13:14-Acts13:15), translated as "encouragement").

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 13:22

## Hebrews 13:23 (id: 13193)

This Timothy might have traveled with Paul (see "Timothy" Profile). If that's the case, the New Testament does not mention his imprisonment. He clearly knows both the author and the recipients of this letter.

## Hebrews 13:24–25 (id: 13194)

* The book ends with a formal greeting and a blessing.
* *Those from Italy:* The author is likely writing back to Rome from another place in the Mediterranean world. Some scholars, however, think the author may have been writing from Rome itself.
