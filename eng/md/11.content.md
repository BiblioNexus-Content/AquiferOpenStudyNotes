## 1 Kings 1:1–3 (id: 15370)

At seventy years of age ([2 Sam 5:4–5](https://ref.ly/2Sam5:4-2Sam5:5)), David was feeble, perhaps because of years of warfare and stress. He needed a young person to impart warmth, a medical remedy also described in Josephus’s *Antiquities* and by the Greek physician Galen. David’s diminishing powers encouraged Adonijah’s attempts to take the throne.

## 1 Kings 1:1–2.12 (id: 15369)

The book of 1 Kings begins with the Lord's promise to David (see [2 Samuel 7:11–16](https://ref.ly/2Sam7:11-2Sam7:16)). Solomon was the rightful and God\-chosen heir to what God gave his father David. The problems during Solomon's rise to power suggested there would be more troubles later in his reign and between Israel and Judah in the future([1 Kings 1:1–2:46](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:1-1Kgs2:46); [11:12–43](https://ref.ly/1Kgs11:1-1Kgs11:43)).

## 1 Kings 1:5–6 (id: 15381)

Adonijah was David’s fourth son. Because his older brothers, Amnon, Daniel, and Absalom, were all dead, Adonijah assumed he would succeed his father. Yet, in keeping with ancient Near Eastern custom, Solomon—the son of David’s favored wife, Bathsheba—was to succeed him as king. David had already communicated this fact to Solomon ([1:13](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:13), [17](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:17); [1 Chr 22:6–10](https://ref.ly/1Chr22:6-1Chr22:10)). Adonijah’s self\-seeking nature, likely encouraged by his father’s lax discipline, surfaced in his declaration, “I will make myself king.”

Joab, David’s military commander, and Abiathar, the high priest, gave Adonijah powerful military and religious backing in his pursuit of the throne.

## 1 Kings 1:8 (id: 15384)

Solomon also had influential friends supporting his right to become king. Zadok was in the priestly line of Eleazar, Benaiah commanded David’s bodyguard and his thirty mighty men ([2 Sam 23:20–23](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:20-2Sam23:23)), Shimei was one of Solomon’s district governors ([1 Kgs 4:18](https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:18)), and Nathan was David’s trusted prophet. Rei is unknown beyond this verse.

## 1 Kings 1:9 (id: 15385)

En\-rogel (modern Bir Ayyub, “Job’s well”) lay south of Jerusalem at the intersection of the Kidron and Hinnom valleys. Earlier, it harbored David’s two informants, Jonathan and Ahimaaz, during Absalom’s rebellion (see [2 Sam 17:17](https://ref.ly/2Sam17:17)).

## 1 Kings 1:11–14 (id: 15371)

Bathsheba was Solomon’s mother and David’s favored wife. Their affair led to the death of Bathsheba’s husband, Uriah the Hittite (see [2 Sam 11:1–27](https://ref.ly/2Sam11:1-2Sam11:27)). • Nathan, the prophet who revealed God’s covenant with David ([2 Sam 7:1–17](https://ref.ly/2Sam7:1-2Sam7:17)) and announced God’s love for Solomon at his birth ([2 Sam 12:24–25](https://ref.ly/2Sam12:24-2Sam12:25)), confirmed God’s selection of Solomon to succeed David as king (see [1 Chr 28:4–7](https://ref.ly/1Chr28:4-1Chr28:7)). Although Nathan had sharply rebuked David for his affair with Bathsheba and his murder of Uriah ([2 Sam 12:1–15](https://ref.ly/2Sam12:1-2Sam12:15)), the king respected the prophet. • Adonijah certainly observed Nathan’s close association with Bathsheba and Solomon. All three could expect to be killed if Adonijah’s plot to seize the throne succeeded (see [1 Kgs 15:29](https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:29); [16:11](https://ref.ly/1Kgs16:11)).

## 1 Kings 1:33 (id: 15374)

Riding the king’s own mule was a sign of prestige. In an ancient text from Mari, King Zimri\-Lim was advised that royal protocol would be served by his riding in a donkey cart. David’s sons rode mules ([2 Sam 13:29](https://ref.ly/2Sam13:29); [18:9](https://ref.ly/2Sam18:9)). Similarly Zechariah predicts that Israel’s king will come “riding on a donkey’s colt” ([Zech 9:9](https://ref.ly/Zech9:9)), a prophecy fulfilled by Jesus ([Matt 21:4–7](https://ref.ly/Matt21:4-Matt21:7); [John 12:14–15](https://ref.ly/John12:14-John12:15)). With Solomon mounted on David’s royal mule, the people would know that Solomon’s anointing as king had David’s blessing. • The Gihon Spring, just outside Jerusalem’s eastern slopes, was the city’s major water source. In this common gathering place, Solomon’s anointing would be well known, yet not visible to Adonijah’s supporters at En\-rogel.

## 1 Kings 1:34 (id: 15375)

Solomon’s anointing followed established protocol in being administered by a prophet (see [1 Sam 16:1–13](https://ref.ly/1Sam16:1-1Sam16:13)). • Priests also played significant roles in royal matters, and the populace would welcome Zadok’s blessing. David later confirmed Solomon’s kingship in a public ceremony ([1 Chr 29:22](https://ref.ly/1Chr29:22)).

sit on my throne: Due to David’s age and infirmities, Solomon officiated publicly for about two years before his father died. Co\-regency provided for orderly royal succession and became commonplace during Israel’s divided monarchy. It was also practiced in Egypt. • The Hebrew term for ruler, used for various leadership positions, can have theological significance; the king was seen as both a spiritual and administrative leader of God’s people (see [Deut 31:10–11](https://ref.ly/Deut31:10-Deut31:11); [1 Chr 28:4–6](https://ref.ly/1Chr28:4-1Chr28:6); [Ps 89:3–4](https://ref.ly/Ps89:3-Ps89:4); [Isa 55:3–4](https://ref.ly/Isa55:3-Isa55:4)).

Fearing for his life, Adonijah sought refuge at the horns (projections at the corners) of the altar ([Exod 27:2](https://ref.ly/Exod27:2)), hoping for mercy according to biblical precedent (cp. [Exod 21:12–14](https://ref.ly/Exod21:12-Exod21:14)). However, such protection was provided only for unintentional homicide, so Adonijah’s treason could only be forgiven by the king. Solomon treated him graciously on the condition that he remain loyal. Appearances aside, Adonijah was still looking for ways to usurp the kingship and was later killed as a troublemaker ([1 Kgs 2:13–25](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:13-1Kgs2:25)).

David gave his final charge to Solomon in two sections: personal advice for spiritual living ([2:2–4](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:2-1Kgs2:4)) and instructions about people David had dealt with ([2:5–9](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:5-1Kgs2:9)).

## 1 Kings 2:2 (id: 15555)

Take courage and be a man: God and Moses had given this same charge to Joshua at the time of the conquest ([Deut 31:6–7](https://ref.ly/Deut31:6-Deut31:7); [Josh 1:6–7](https://ref.ly/Josh1:6-Josh1:7), [9](https://ref.ly/Josh1:9)). Joshua and Hezekiah gave this admonition to Israelite forces when facing enemies ([Josh 1:16–18](https://ref.ly/Josh1:16-Josh1:18); [10:24–28](https://ref.ly/Josh10:24-Josh10:28); [2 Chr 32:7](https://ref.ly/2Chr32:7)). David had learned the value of godly courage ([Pss 27:13–14](https://ref.ly/Ps27:13-Ps27:14); [31:23–24](https://ref.ly/Ps31:23-Ps31:24)). When Paul urged Christians to be courageous (literally *be men*) and strong ([1 Cor 16:13](https://ref.ly/1Cor16:13)), he used the same words as the Greek Old Testament uses for the charges by Moses, Joshua, Hezekiah, and the Lord. An interesting parallel is found in the account of Bishop Polycarp’s martyrdom. As he was led into the stadium facing execution, Polycarp heard a voice from heaven saying, “Be strong, Polycarp, be a man!” (*Martyrdom of Polycarp* 9:1\).

## 1 Kings 2:2–4 (id: 15550)

David’s advice to Solomon combined the spiritual and ethical standards of Deuteronomy, the standards of the covenant through Moses (see [Lev 18:4–5](https://ref.ly/Lev18:4-Lev18:5); [Deut 5:33](https://ref.ly/Deut5:33); [6:4–5](https://ref.ly/Deut6:4-Deut6:5); [8:6](https://ref.ly/Deut8:6); [10:12](https://ref.ly/Deut10:12)), and the promises of the covenant with David ([2 Sam 7:12–16](https://ref.ly/2Sam7:12-2Sam7:16), [25](https://ref.ly/2Sam7:25)). If Solomon would keep God’s standards of righteousness, the promises would be transmitted to his heir, who in turn could claim God’s blessings and convey them to subsequent generations ([Ps 89:3–4](https://ref.ly/Ps89:3-Ps89:4), [20](https://ref.ly/Ps89:20), [24](https://ref.ly/Ps89:24), [27–37](https://ref.ly/Ps89:27-Ps89:37)). • The preeminent heir of David, the Messiah, would embody true righteousness ([Isa 11:1–5](https://ref.ly/Isa11:1-Isa11:5)), receive the full benefits of the covenant ([Jer 33:14–16](https://ref.ly/Jer33:14-Jer33:16)), and enact a new covenant with the people of Israel and Judah ([Jer 31:31–34](https://ref.ly/Jer31:31-Jer31:34); [Ezek 34:24–31](https://ref.ly/Ezek34:24-Ezek34:31); [37:24–28](https://ref.ly/Ezek37:24-Ezek37:28)). The New Testament reveals Jesus as that son of David who has come ([Matt 1:1](https://ref.ly/Matt1:1); [Rom 1:1–4](https://ref.ly/Rom1:1-Rom1:4)); he will come again to fulfill Old Testament prophecies and bless all people ([Luke 1:67–79](https://ref.ly/Luke1:67-Luke1:79); [Gal 3:26–29](https://ref.ly/Gal3:26-Gal3:29); [Rev 3:21](https://ref.ly/Rev3:21)).

Joab had supported David’s bid for kingship but had become too ambitious. He had murdered former military rivals Abner ([2 Sam 3:22–30](https://ref.ly/2Sam3:22-2Sam3:30)) and Amasa ([2 Sam 20:10](https://ref.ly/2Sam20:10)), as well as David’s son Absalom ([2 Sam 18:1–18](https://ref.ly/2Sam18:1-2Sam18:18)). A party to David’s murder of Uriah the Hittite ([2 Sam 11:14–27](https://ref.ly/2Sam11:14-2Sam11:27)), Joab had grown very powerful ([2 Sam 20:23](https://ref.ly/2Sam20:23)), and his backing of Adonijah posed a serious threat to Solomon.

David died peacefully after a forty\-year reign, knowing that the kingdom was firmly established in Solomon, his designated heir. Various locations have been proposed for David’s tomb, but none has been confirmed (cp. [Acts 2:29](https://ref.ly/Acts2:29)). Royal tombs were used at least until Hezekiah’s days ([2 Kgs 20:21](https://ref.ly/2Kgs20:21)).

Because Adonijah violated his terms of submission to Solomon ([1:52–53](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:52-1Kgs1:53)), the king ordered Benaiah (see[1:8](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:8), [26](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:26), [38](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:38)) to execute him.

Abiathar had treasonously supported Adonijah ([1:7](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:7), [25](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:25)). But he was deposed rather than killed because he had carried the Ark ([2 Sam 15:24](https://ref.ly/2Sam15:24), [29](https://ref.ly/2Sam15:29), [35](https://ref.ly/2Sam15:35)), had supported David, and had shared all his hardships. Abiathar’s removal from the priesthood fulfilled the Lord’s word about the house of Eli in Ithamar’s line ([1 Sam 2:30–35](https://ref.ly/1Sam2:30-1Sam2:35)). Zadok’s appointment ([1 Kgs 4:2](https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:2)) returned the high priesthood to Eleazar’s line as it had been before Eli ([Num 20:22–28](https://ref.ly/Num20:22-Num20:28); [25:11–13](https://ref.ly/Num25:11-Num25:13); [2 Sam 8:17](https://ref.ly/2Sam8:17); [1 Chr 6:1–8](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:1-1Chr6:8), [50–53](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:50-1Chr6:53); [Ezra 7:2–5](https://ref.ly/Ezra7:2-Ezra7:5)) and as it continued throughout the divided monarchy ([2 Chr 31:10](https://ref.ly/2Chr31:10); [Ezek 43:19](https://ref.ly/Ezek43:19)).

Following Adonijah’s example ([1:50](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:50)), Joab hoped to find mercy by grasping the horns of the altar according to the provisions of the law of Moses ([Exod 21:12–14](https://ref.ly/Exod21:12-Exod21:14); [Num 35:22–25](https://ref.ly/Num35:22-Num35:25); [Deut 19:4–5](https://ref.ly/Deut19:4-Deut19:5)). But because *Joab* was a murderer, he could not claim clemency (see [2 Sam 3:27](https://ref.ly/2Sam3:27); [18:14](https://ref.ly/2Sam18:14); [20:10](https://ref.ly/2Sam20:10)).

Shimei’s journey to Gath, ostensibly to recover his runaway slaves, violated his agreement. Technically, he did not cross the Kidron Valley in going to *Gath,* but the penalty was understood by both parties to apply to Shimei’s going anywhere else. Because Shimei violated his oath to the Lord ([2:43](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:43)) and because of his past hostilities toward David ([2 Sam 16:5–13](https://ref.ly/2Sam16:5-2Sam16:13); [19:16–23](https://ref.ly/2Sam19:16-2Sam19:23)), Solomon instructed Benaiah to execute him.

## 1 Kings 3:1 (id: 15616)

As was common in the ancient Near East, Solomon sealed a political alliance with the king of Egypt by marrying one of his daughters. The bestowal of an Egyptian princess and the city of Gezer to Solomon as a wedding present ([9:16](https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:16)) demonstrated the Egyptians’ high regard for him. The pharaoh was probably Siamun, of Egypt’s weakened 21st dynasty. The alliance was mutually beneficial: Pharaoh gained access to trade routes through Israel, while Solomon increased security on his southern border. Apparently, Solomon had previously married the Ammonite Naamah (see [11:42–43](https://ref.ly/1Kgs11:42-1Kgs11:43) with [14:21](https://ref.ly/1Kgs14:21)). • City of David: This section of Jerusalem was the old Jebusite city in the southern portion of the eastern ridge. When Solomon extended his building activities northward, he built a special palace for Pharaoh’s daughter ([7:8](https://ref.ly/1Kgs7:8); [9:24](https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:24); [2 Chr 8:11](https://ref.ly/2Chr8:11)).

The Ark of the Covenant sat in David’s tent in Jerusalem before the Temple was built, and the people … sacrificed their offerings at local places of worship (see study note on 8:1). However, this detracted from unified worship at a central sanctuary ([12:1–24](https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:1-1Kgs12:24)) and increased the danger of mixing with Canaanite religious practices. Israel’s worship at such places was forbidden ([Deut 12:1–14](https://ref.ly/Deut12:1-Deut12:14)).

The city of Gibeon lay six miles northwest of Jerusalem. Its altar, the most important of these \[local] places of worship (literally *the great high place*), accommodated sacrifices of royal proportions. *Gibeon* was also the site of the Tabernacle ([1 Chr 16:39–40](https://ref.ly/1Chr16:39-1Chr16:40); [21:29](https://ref.ly/1Chr21:29); [2 Chr 1:2–6](https://ref.ly/2Chr1:2-2Chr1:6)).

God’s gift of wisdom to Solomon is narrated as a *chiasm* (a symmetrical arrangement in which sections A and B are mirrored by sections B’ and A’), drawing the focus in on Solomon’s transaction with the Lord: A: While he sacrificed at Gibeon … the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream ([3:4–5](https://ref.ly/1Kgs3:4-1Kgs3:5)). B: Solomon prayed for wisdom to govern his people equitably and efficiently ([3:6–9](https://ref.ly/1Kgs3:6-1Kgs3:9)). B’: The Lord favorably answered his request and granted additional blessings ([3:10–14](https://ref.ly/1Kgs3:10-1Kgs3:14)). A’: Solomon awoke from the dream and offered additional sacrifices to the Lord ([3:15](https://ref.ly/1Kgs3:15)).

The Hebrew term translated little child was often used of someone who lacked experience in his profession (“assistant,” [19:21](https://ref.ly/1Kgs19:21)). Solomon humbly recognized his inexperience and his need for an understanding heart. If he desired to govern the people well and render proper decisions, he knew that he needed God’s help.

Samuel had warned about this loathsome institution ([1 Sam 8:12–17](https://ref.ly/1Sam8:12-1Sam8:17)), and the leaders of Israel later complained about it to Solomon’s son Rehoboam ([1 Kgs 12:4](https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:4)).

Following the pattern of the Tabernacle, the inner sanctuary, which was overlaid … inside with solid gold, was separated from the main room of the Temple by a curtain ([2 Chr 3:14](https://ref.ly/2Chr3:14)) and gold chains. Like the Most Holy Place in the Tabernacle, the *inner sanctuary* was a perfect cube. It housed the Ark of the Lord’s Covenant that symbolized God’s presence. The place of atonement was atop the *Ark* ([Exod 25:17](https://ref.ly/Exod25:17)); the high priest annually made propitiation for the Israelites by sprinkling the sacrificial blood of the atonement on it ([Lev 16:1–19](https://ref.ly/Lev16:1-Lev16:19)). • The altar that belonged to the Most Holy Place stood in the main room.

The altar was made of cedar and covered with *gold.* • Like the *inner sanctuary,* the main room was also completely *overlaid with gold,* which reminded the priests that Almighty God was present.

Before describing the Temple’s furnishings, the writer mentions the construction of Solomon’s palace complex. The multiple buildings within this complex took nearly twice as long to build (thirteen years) as the Temple (seven years, [6:38](https://ref.ly/1Kgs6:38)). The entire building project took twenty years ([9:10](https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:10)). Although construction details are brief, archaeological discovery of two of Solomon’s buildings provides an idea of how this palace might have looked. Despite its grandeur, Solomon’s palace is not the author’s focus; his interest is in the Temple, God’s dwelling place.

His skillful metal work is detailed in the following verses ([1 Kgs 7:15–50](https://ref.ly/1Kgs7:15-1Kgs7:50)). • skillful and talented (literally *filled with wisdom and* *understanding and knowledge*): The Israelites placed great emphasis on practical skills and considered them a form of wisdom ([Prov 22:29](https://ref.ly/Prov22:29)).

The giant bronze basin called the Sea replaced the smaller bronze washbasin used in the Tabernacle service (see [Exod 30:17–21](https://ref.ly/Exod30:17-Exod30:21)). The Sea was cast as one solid piece, excluding the twelve bronze oxen on which it sat. The oxen were placed so that three faced each direction, perhaps to remind priests that they served God on behalf of all twelve tribes of Israel. Ahaz later replaced the oxen with a stone base ([2 Kgs 16:17](https://ref.ly/2Kgs16:17)). The priests used the Sea, like the bronze washbasin before it, for ceremonial washing ([2 Chr 4:6](https://ref.ly/2Chr4:6)) as they prepared to minister before God (see [Exod 30:17–21](https://ref.ly/Exod30:17-Exod30:21)). The apparent discrepancy in the volume of water it could hold (see [2 Chr 4:5](https://ref.ly/2Chr4:5)) is probably due to standards of measurement that varied according to place and time.

The gold altar replaced the altar for burning incense used in the Tabernacle ([Exod 30:1–10](https://ref.ly/Exod30:1-Exod30:10)). The one table and one lampstand used in the Tabernacle ([Exod 25:23–40](https://ref.ly/Exod25:23-Exod25:40)) were replaced by ten such sets in the Temple. Although the author lists a single gold table for the Bread of the Presence, the Chronicler reports ten tables, five on each side of the Temple’s main room (cp. [2 Chr 4:8](https://ref.ly/2Chr4:8)), along with ten lampstands of solid gold. The bread represented God’s provision for his people, and the lampstand characterized God as the source of life and truth. Both symbols pointed to Christ, the bread of life ([John 6:35](https://ref.ly/John6:35)) and the light of the world ([John 8:12](https://ref.ly/John8:12)).

Solomon’s building activities climaxed with the Ark’s move to the newly erected Temple. The king offered both prayer ([8:22–53](https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:22-1Kgs8:53)) and words of praise and blessing ([8:56–61](https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:56-1Kgs8:61)) to dedicate the Temple for the Lord’s service. After the dedication, the assembled gathering enjoyed the great Festival of Shelters. The focus of the account is on Solomon praising God and blessing the people ([8:12–61](https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:12-1Kgs8:61)).

## 1 Kings 8:2 (id: 15681)

Although the Temple was completed in the eighth month ([6:38](https://ref.ly/1Kgs6:38)), Solomon apparently delayed the dedication until the following year so it could take place at the annual Festival of Shelters, which is held in early autumn in the month of Ethanim. This schedule allowed time to prepare for the spectacular celebration and gave the occasion double significance. As prescribed in the law, Solomon and the people expressed their gratitude to God for the completed harvest season. They also celebrated the fulfillment of Moses’ song of deliverance, which promised that God would one day settle his people in the Promised Land and make his dwelling there ([Exod 15:17](https://ref.ly/Exod15:17); [Deut 12:10–14](https://ref.ly/Deut12:10-Deut12:14)). Solomon’s dedicatory prayer and blessing may indicate that he was consciously leading his people in covenantal renewal, as prescribed in [Deut 31:10–13](https://ref.ly/Deut31:10-Deut31:13), in the seventh month of the seventh year of his reign.

As the priests came out of the Holy Place, they were greeted with music praising the Lord ([2 Chr 5:11–14](https://ref.ly/2Chr5:11-2Chr5:14)). Previously, the glorious presence of the Lord had filled the Tabernacle ([Exod 40:34–35](https://ref.ly/Exod40:34-Exod40:35)). Now it filled the Temple to show that God was again dwelling among his people. Ezekiel recorded its later departure from the Temple ([Ezek 10:18–19](https://ref.ly/Ezek10:18-Ezek10:19)), to return at a blessed future time ([Ezek 43:1–5](https://ref.ly/Ezek43:1-Ezek43:5)). In the New Testament, John wrote that God dwells among his people through his son, Jesus Christ ([John 1:14](https://ref.ly/John1:14)). Paul affirmed that Christ now dwells in each believer ([Col 1:27](https://ref.ly/Col1:27)) as a foretaste of a future when “God’s home is … among his people” ([Rev 21:3](https://ref.ly/Rev21:3)).

Jesus condemned hypocritical individuals who displayed religiosity without true, heartfelt belief ([Matt 6:5–8](https://ref.ly/Matt6:5-Matt6:8)). But Solomon’s public piety was genuine, leading his people in worship and encouraging them to live in full dependence upon God. The nation that knows and obeys the Lord, and whose leaders rule in righteousness, is particularly blessed ([2 Chr 7:14](https://ref.ly/2Chr7:14); [Pss 33:12](https://ref.ly/Ps33:12); [45:6–7](https://ref.ly/Ps45:6-Ps45:7); [144:15](https://ref.ly/Ps144:15); [Prov 29:2](https://ref.ly/Prov29:2); [Isa 11:1–5](https://ref.ly/Isa11:1-Isa11:5)).

However, Hiram was dissatisfied with the towns, so he returned them to Solomon’s control (see [2 Chr 8:2](https://ref.ly/2Chr8:2)).

He also fortified the key cities of Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer. Archaeological research shows that the walls and gates of all three cities have distinctive traits attributable to Solomon’s time. *Hazor,* in the north, was a first line of defense against invasion. *Megiddo,* in the Plain of Sharon, also had strategic military importance ([2 Kgs 23:29–30](https://ref.ly/2Kgs23:29-2Kgs23:30); [Rev 16:12–16](https://ref.ly/Rev16:12-Rev16:16)).

Solomon noted the work ethic of Jeroboam during the repair of the city’s structures and put him in charge.

Ahijah’s symbolic tearing of his cloak into twelve pieces and giving ten of these pieces to Jeroboam symbolized God’s plans for Jeroboam and Israel following Solomon’s death (see “Prophetic Sign Acts” Theme Note). Ten of the tribes would defect; one tribe (Judah) would remain with Solomon’s heir. The twelfth tribe was probably Benjamin (see [1 Kgs 12:21](https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:21)).

Rehoboam’s decision to heed the counsel of his younger advisers was disastrous; it led the northern tribes to secede, followed by years of intermittent warfare ([14:30](https://ref.ly/1Kgs14:30); [15:7](https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:7), [32](https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:32)). • the will of the Lord: God directed these human decisions to fulfill the prophesied judgment against Solomon ([11:11–13](https://ref.ly/1Kgs11:11-1Kgs11:13), [29–39](https://ref.ly/1Kgs11:29-1Kgs11:39)).

Rehoboam resolved to restore the kingdom to himself by force, but he turned back when confronted with the message of the Lord through Shemaiah. The expression man of God emphasizes a prophet’s relationship to the Lord as his messenger. God’s prophets played a leading role in the history of the divided kingdom. Shemaiah apparently authored a history of Rehoboam’s reign ([2 Chr 12:15](https://ref.ly/2Chr12:15)).

Two gold calves would strike a responsive chord regarding Israel’s history ([Exod 32](https://ref.ly/Exod32:1-Exod32:35); esp. [32:4](https://ref.ly/Exod32:4)). Similar religious practices, associated with the Canaanite god Baal\-Hadad, also appealed to the remaining Canaanite population in the northern kingdom. Jeroboam’s intentions compromised true worship and caused religious confusion (see [1 Kgs 14:9](https://ref.ly/1Kgs14:9); [Hos 8:6](https://ref.ly/Hos8:6)).

By placing the calf idols in Bethel (the southern part of Israel) and in Dan (the far northern section) Jeroboam gave his people two choice sites with long religious traditions (see [Gen 12:8](https://ref.ly/Gen12:8); [28:11–19](https://ref.ly/Gen28:11-Gen28:19); [Judg 18:30–31](https://ref.ly/Judg18:30-Judg18:31)). Archaeological excavations confirm the existence of a high place—an altar for pagan worship—in Dan. Bethel was where Jacob had his dream ([Gen 28:10–22](https://ref.ly/Gen28:10-Gen28:22)), and it was the resting place of the Ark of the Covenant in the days of the judges ([Judg 20:18–28](https://ref.ly/Judg20:18-Judg20:28)) and a sanctuary in Samuel’s time ([1 Sam 7:16](https://ref.ly/1Sam7:16); [10:3](https://ref.ly/1Sam10:3)).

Jeroboam directly violated the law of Moses, which prohibited worship at pagan shrines ([Deut 12:2–7](https://ref.ly/Deut12:2-Deut12:7)) and specified that priests were to come only from the tribe of Levi ([Exod 40:13–15](https://ref.ly/Exod40:13-Exod40:15); [Num 1:50–53](https://ref.ly/Num1:50-Num1:53)).

Replacing the Festival of Shelters, Israel’s crowning ceremonial feast in the seventh month, with the festival in Bethel also violated the law ([Deut 16:13–15](https://ref.ly/Deut16:13-Deut16:15)). The imitation observance one month later during the eighth month may have coincided with the end of the Canaanite agricultural year. Jeroboam’s false religious practices led to Israel’s downfall ([2 Kgs 17:22](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:22)). • Jeroboam’s offering of sacrifices on the altar at Bethel set a bad precedent in spiritual leadership.

The account of the unnamed man of God who denounced Jeroboam’s false altar at Bethel emphasizes the authority of God’s word. Like Isaiah’s prophecy of Cyrus’s coming ([Isa 44:28](https://ref.ly/Isa44:28); [45:1](https://ref.ly/Isa45:1)) and Micah’s prophecy about Bethlehem as the Messiah’s birthplace ([Mic 5:2](https://ref.ly/Mic5:2)), this prophecy gave a distinctive proper name associated with an event long before it happened ([2 Kgs 23:15–20](https://ref.ly/2Kgs23:15-2Kgs23:20)). Such prophecies give assurance of God’s sovereignty and omniscience (see [Isa 42:9](https://ref.ly/Isa42:9)).

Whatever the old prophet’s motives were for seeking out the man of God, he clearly lied about receiving God’s message through an angel.

Although the old prophet had lied, God communicated through him. The severe pronouncement against the man of God was that because of his disobedience, he would be denied burial in his ancestral tomb. This death sentence was quickly carried out. Disobedience to the clear command of God is a serious offense ([Num 14:21–23](https://ref.ly/Num14:21-Num14:23); [Deut 11:26–28](https://ref.ly/Deut11:26-Deut11:28)).

the message … will certainly come true: The Lord’s swift judgment convinced the old prophet that the oracle of judgment pronounced by the man of God against Jeroboam’s altar would be fulfilled. The prophecy came true years later during Josiah’s reforms ([2 Kgs 23:15–18](https://ref.ly/2Kgs23:15-2Kgs23:18)). • Samaria was established as the capital city of Israel during the reign of Omri, first king of Israel’s third dynasty ([1 Kgs 16:24](https://ref.ly/1Kgs16:24), [29–33](https://ref.ly/1Kgs16:29-1Kgs16:33)). The name *Samaria* sometimes refers to the capital city and sometimes to the northern kingdom in general ([2 Kgs 17:24](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:24); [Amos 6:1](https://ref.ly/Amos6:1)). Samaria’s mention here reflects the perspective of an author living at a later time. Similar uses of location names elsewhere reflect editorial updating (cp.

Apparently, Jeroboam knew what had happened to the man of God, but it did nothing to change his spiritual outlook.

Before that, the Tabernacle resided there ([Josh 18:1](https://ref.ly/Josh18:1); [1 Sam 1:3](https://ref.ly/1Sam1:3)).

Despite clear evidence of God’s displeasure and coming judgment ([1 Kgs 13:33](https://ref.ly/1Kgs13:33)), he failed to turn from his ways. His sin would bring grave consequences to his family and descendants ([13:34](https://ref.ly/1Kgs13:34); [14:10–11](https://ref.ly/1Kgs14:10-1Kgs14:11), [14](https://ref.ly/1Kgs14:14)) and, ultimately, to the whole northern kingdom ([14:16](https://ref.ly/1Kgs14:16)). • gold calves: see [12:26–30](https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:26-1Kgs12:30).

Baasha began to reign in Asa’s third year ([15:33](https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:33)); when Baasha was established, Judah faced renewed hostilities with Israel. Asa also withstood an attack by Zerah the Ethiopian ([2 Chr 14:9–12](https://ref.ly/2Chr14:9-2Chr14:12)), who was apparently a commander in the service of Pharaoh Osorkon I (924–889 BC). Asa and his troops won a great victory and took vast plunder from Zerah’s forces and from towns in the Negev that probably launched the Egyptian invasion.

Baasha’s southward thrust recaptured towns previously lost to Abijam ([2 Chr 13:19](https://ref.ly/2Chr13:19)), as well as Ramah in Judah, about four miles north of Jerusalem. This sealed the border, preventing the Israelites from defecting to Judah and confining Asa to his own territory. Ramah commanded the important north–south and east–west routes in Canaan ([Judg 4:5](https://ref.ly/Judg4:5); [Isa 10:29](https://ref.ly/Isa10:29); [Jer 31:15](https://ref.ly/Jer31:15); [40:1](https://ref.ly/Jer40:1)).

Ben\-hadad … the king of Aram and his successors were a major factor in Aramean\-Israelite relations for many years. Asa’s appeal for Ben\-hadad’s help was reinforced with rich gifts taken from the Temple treasury. Despite previous enmity between the Arameans and Israel ([11:23–25](https://ref.ly/1Kgs11:23-1Kgs11:25); [2 Sam 8:3–12](https://ref.ly/2Sam8:3-2Sam8:12); [2 Chr 8:3–4](https://ref.ly/2Chr8:3-2Chr8:4)), Ben\-hadad and Baasha had established a treaty. Asa understood that the Aramean king’s assistance could be purchased for the right price ([1 Kgs 15:20](https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:20)). When God’s prophet Hanani delivered the Lord’s rebuke to Asa for approaching Ben\-hadad, Asa reacted uncharacteristically and threw him into prison ([2 Chr 16:7–10](https://ref.ly/2Chr16:7-2Chr16:10)). Asa apparently forgot God’s previous intervention on his behalf against Zerah’s sizeable army ([2 Chr 14:7–8](https://ref.ly/2Chr14:7-2Chr14:8)).

As a result of King Asa’s request*,* the war with Baasha quickly turned to Asa’s advantage. Ben\-hadad swiftly captured several sections of northern Israel and secured important northern trade routes, forcing Baasha to cease operations in Ramah in order to meet the emergency on his northern frontier. Asa retook Ramah and used its building materials to fortify other strategic border towns against further moves by Baasha.

The spiritual evaluation of Ahab is the worst yet among the kings of Israel. Later, Ahab’s evil behavior was attributed to his being “under the influence of his wife Jezebel” ([21:25](https://ref.ly/1Kgs21:25)). Ahab and Jezebel propagated Canaanite worship rites, leading Israel further from the Lord. Added to Jeroboam’s false worship system, these sins eventually spelled disaster for Israel.

Despite Joshua’s curse against Jericho ([Josh 6:26–27](https://ref.ly/Josh6:26-Josh6:27)), the site was occasionally and temporarily occupied prior to being rebuilt by Hiel (see [Judg 3:13](https://ref.ly/Judg3:13); [2 Sam 10:5](https://ref.ly/2Sam10:5); [1 Chr 19:5](https://ref.ly/1Chr19:5)), as archaeological excavations confirm. Hiel’s efforts signify the spiritual defection of Israel. • When he laid its foundation … Segub: The Targum (an interpretive Aramaic translation for Jews who did not know Hebrew after the Exile) suggests that Hiel sacrificed his sons as foundation offerings according to pagan practices; others understand the deaths to be from disease or accident. The sentence might be a Hebrew *merism* (using boundaries to indicate everything in between), which would imply that all of Hiel’s sons died.

Elijah was God’s prophet to the northern kingdom during the reigns of the third\-dynasty kings Ahab (874–853 BC) and Ahaziah (853–852 BC) and into that of Joram (852–841 BC). • Elijah showed his commitment to the Lord by declaring that he served the living God of Israel. • Elijah withheld the dew and rain as a direct affront to Baal, who supposedly controlled these natural forces. Their absence until God led Elijah to give the word initiated the contest with Baal that would reach a climax on Mount Carmel (ch [18](https://ref.ly/1Kgs18:1-1Kgs18:46)).

The ministry of the prophet Elijah was intimately connected to his own spiritual journey. Elijah confronted Israel’s flirtation with the Canaanite storm\-god, Baal. As the struggle ensued, Elijah learned of God’s power and provision in contrast to Baal’s impotence, as demonstrated during Elijah’s contest with the prophets of Baal on Mount Carmel ([18:1–46](https://ref.ly/1Kgs18:1-1Kgs18:46)). Elijah’s subsequent flight from Jezebel led to God’s renewal of his prophetic commission at Mount Sinai ([19:1–18](https://ref.ly/1Kgs19:1-1Kgs19:18)). Elijah’s commission was completed by his successor, Elisha ([19:19–21](https://ref.ly/1Kgs19:19-1Kgs19:21)).

Zarephath was in Phoenician territory about seven miles south of Sidon, away from Ahab’s jurisdiction.

Obedience ([1 Sam 15:22](https://ref.ly/1Sam15:22); [Ps 40:1–6](https://ref.ly/Ps40:1-Ps40:6); [Isa 1:10–20](https://ref.ly/Isa1:10-Isa1:20)), trust ([Ps 37:3](https://ref.ly/Ps37:3); [Prov 3:5–6](https://ref.ly/Prov3:5-Prov3:6)), and faithfulness ([Ps 18:25](https://ref.ly/Ps18:25); [Rev 2:10](https://ref.ly/Rev2:10)) are foundational attributes for successful spiritual service. • God’s ongoing provision for Elijah and the widow of Zarephath demonstrated God’s concern for all people who put him first. • water … bread: Elijah asked for the basic staples of life, but these were in scarce supply as the drought spread into Phoenician territory.

troublemakers: Although Elijah announced the onset of the drought ([17:1](https://ref.ly/1Kgs17:1)), it was Ahab and his family who brought God’s judgment upon Israel by their violations of the covenant and their sponsorship of Baal worship (see [Lev 26:19](https://ref.ly/Lev26:19); [Deut 28:15](https://ref.ly/Deut28:15), [23](https://ref.ly/Deut28:23); [2 Chr 7:13](https://ref.ly/2Chr7:13); [Jer 14:1–7](https://ref.ly/Jer14:1-Jer14:7); [Amos 4:7–8](https://ref.ly/Amos4:7-Amos4:8)).

Mount Carmel lies on a ridge dividing the coastal plain of Palestine. The site was known for Canaanite idol worship; an altar to the Lord had also been built there earlier ([18:30](https://ref.ly/1Kgs18:30)). It was a natural location for the contest with Baal. Although the Septuagint (a Greek translation of the Old Testament) may indicate that the prophets of Asherah attended the ensuing contest on *Mount Carmel*, the Hebrew text does not (cp. [18:22](https://ref.ly/1Kgs18:22)).

The Hebrew word translated waver means “to be lame” or “to limp.” Elijah compared the people’s hobbling between the worship of the Lord and of Baal to a person who limps awkwardly from one foot to the other. Elijah may have also been referring to the ritual dance performed by Baal’s prophets as they attempted to gain the storm\-god’s attention ([18:26](https://ref.ly/1Kgs18:26)).

However, Elijah’s public stature must have left him feeling alone in his struggle against false religion (see [19:10](https://ref.ly/1Kgs19:10), [14](https://ref.ly/1Kgs19:14)); certainly, he did stand alone in confronting the 450 prophets of Baal.

Elijah was afraid: The NLT follows the Greek Old Testament and a majority of scholars in translating Elijah’s reaction as one of fear, proposing a reading of wayyira’ (“he feared”) in the original Hebrew. The Hebrew text as we have it reads, “he saw it” (wayyare’)—i.e., the danger in Jezebel’s threat. Rather than a warm reception after the spectacular victory, and a hoped\-for repentance beginning with the royal house, Elijah faced a death threat. • Beersheba lay at the southern end of the country. A familiar formula described the limits of the land as “from Dan … to Beersheba” ([4:25](https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:25); [2 Sam 24:2](https://ref.ly/2Sam24:2)).

Elijah’s determination to go to Mount Sinai took him on a journey of approximately 200 miles. The trip would not have required forty days and forty nights, so Elijah may have set a pace that was symbolic of Israel’s past. Moses spent forty days on Mount Sinai, and Israel subsequently wandered in the wilderness for forty years ([Num 14:33–34](https://ref.ly/Num14:33-Num14:34); [Deut 1:2–3](https://ref.ly/Deut1:2-Deut1:3)). Forty sometimes represented a period of full testing ([Gen 7:4](https://ref.ly/Gen7:4); [Ps 95:10](https://ref.ly/Ps95:10); [Jon 3:4](https://ref.ly/Jonah3:4); [Matt 4:1–2](https://ref.ly/Matt4:1-Matt4:2)).

The Lord’s question may have a double implication: Why had Elijah come, and did he understand the significance of the spot where he stood? Elijah replied to the former part of the question. Elijah had boldly announced that he was alone in his stand for the Lord ([1 Kgs 18:22](https://ref.ly/1Kgs18:22)); now, that feeling turned to self\-pity.

Now he learned that there were 7,000 others who remained faithful to the Lord. • bowed down … or kissed him: These common forms of submission in the ancient Near East ([2 Kgs 21:3](https://ref.ly/2Kgs21:3); [Isa 46:6](https://ref.ly/Isa46:6); [60:14](https://ref.ly/Isa60:14); [Hos 13:2](https://ref.ly/Hos13:2)) are often mentioned in the annals of victorious kings or in the ancient epics. Ashurbanipal reported that on his sixth campaign, an Elamite king kissed his royal feet and tidied up the ground with his beard. In the Mesopotamian creation epic (*Enuma Elish,* V 86\), even the great gods bowed down and kissed the feet of Marduk, the victorious head of the pantheon.

His meal with family and friends may have been a thanksgiving sacrifice to God capped by a communal meal in joyful celebration of God’s claim upon Elisha’s life. • Elisha would first serve as Elijah’s assistant. Great leaders often begin as good learners. Joshua was Moses’ assistant ([Exod 24:13](https://ref.ly/Exod24:13)) before becoming his successor ([Num 27:18–23](https://ref.ly/Num27:18-Num27:23); [Deut 34:9](https://ref.ly/Deut34:9)) and assuming command of the forces of Israel ([Josh 1:1–9](https://ref.ly/Josh1:1-Josh1:9)).

burlap … ropes: Knowing the merciful mindset of the kings of Israel, Ben\-hadad’s officers advised that they approach Ahab with symbols of humble repentance ([Joel 1:13](https://ref.ly/Joel1:13); [Jon 3:5–9](https://ref.ly/Jonah3:5-Jonah3:9)) and submission ([Job 12:18](https://ref.ly/Job12:18); [Lam 1:14](https://ref.ly/Lam1:14)). Ancient Near Eastern reliefs often depict captured enemies with ropes around their necks. Assyrian kings boasted of piercing their captives’ lips or cheeks with ropes.

my brother: Ahab spoke to Ben\-hadad in terms that politely indicated the Aramean king’s royal authority and Ahab’s desire for good relations. Ahab welcomed Ben\-hadad into his chariot to demonstrate his warm reception of the king, yet serving notice that he should recognize Ahab as his equal. Correspondence and parity agreements between kings of the ancient Near East used the language of brotherhood to express friendship, good relations, or formal equality.

The treaty that Ahab and Ben\-hadad established provided parity between the parties, although it was especially favorable to Ahab as the victor. • The towns that Israel had lost to Aram ([15:20](https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:20)) were restored and Ben\-hadad made important trade concessions to Ahab, who may have reasoned that such an arrangement would be profitable and provide him with an ally against the rising power of Shalmaneser III of Assyria.

Ahab’s leniency toward Ben\-hadad met with God’s disfavor, portrayed in the symbolic actions of an unidentified prophet. God’s prophets often conveyed the Lord’s message through symbolic actions ([Isa 20](https://ref.ly/Isa20:1-Isa20:6); [Jer 27:1–7](https://ref.ly/Jer27:1-Jer27:7); [Ezek 4:1–3](https://ref.ly/Ezek4:1-Ezek4:3), [9–17](https://ref.ly/Ezek4:9-Ezek4:17); [5:1–4](https://ref.ly/Ezek5:1-Ezek5:4)). Ahab had brought judgment upon himself and his people by sparing an untrustworthy enemy rather than trusting further in the Lord.

The Lord had apparently told Ahab to put Ben\-hadad to death (cp. [Josh 6:17–21](https://ref.ly/Josh6:17-Josh6:21)), but Ahab violated his charge, perhaps viewing the Aramean king as part of the spoils of war (cp. [1 Sam 15:1–23](https://ref.ly/1Sam15:1-1Sam15:23)). The king of Israel would regret his folly: He later faced Ben\-hadad in another battle that would cost him his life ([1 Kgs 22:29–37](https://ref.ly/1Kgs22:29-1Kgs22:37)). Rather than learning from the prophet’s rebuke, Ahab went home angry and sullen.

Naboth refused Ahab’s generous offer to buy or exchange land for his vineyard. While he may have desired to sell, Naboth noted that the law said that inherited property should stay in the family or tribe that originally owned it ([Lev 25:23–28](https://ref.ly/Lev25:23-Lev25:28); [Num 36:7–9](https://ref.ly/Num36:7-Num36:9)). Unlike the kings of the surrounding nations, who could seize whatever property they wished ([1 Sam 8:11–17](https://ref.ly/1Sam8:11-1Sam8:17)), Ahab was bound by Israel’s law.

scoundrels (literally *sons of Belial*): The Hebrew expression refers to totally evil reprobates ([Deut 13:13](https://ref.ly/Deut13:13); [Judg 19:22](https://ref.ly/Judg19:22); [1 Sam 10:27](https://ref.ly/1Sam10:27); [Prov 6:12](https://ref.ly/Prov6:12)). Later Jewish writings attributed the name Belial to Satan, a use reflected by Paul in the New Testament ([2 Cor 6:15](https://ref.ly/2Cor6:15)). • Legally, two witnesses were needed to establish a charge against a person ([Deut 19:15](https://ref.ly/Deut19:15); [Matt 18:16](https://ref.ly/Matt18:16)). The twofold charge of Naboth’s blasphemy against God and against the king carried a penalty of death by stoning outside the city ([Deut 17:5–6](https://ref.ly/Deut17:5-Deut17:6); [22:24](https://ref.ly/Deut22:24)). Naboth was apparently put to death on his own land (see [2 Kgs 9:21–26](https://ref.ly/2Kgs9:21-2Kgs9:26)).

Because the charge carried the penalty of state execution ([Deut 13:10–11](https://ref.ly/Deut13:10-Deut13:11); [17:5](https://ref.ly/Deut17:5)) and because Naboth no longer had male heirs, Ahab exercised the royal prerogative of confiscating the property (see [1 Sam 8:14](https://ref.ly/1Sam8:14)).

Elijah delivered the Lord’s sentence against Ahab just as he was about to take possession of the vineyard. Because Ahab was responsible for the death of Naboth and the seizing of his field, Ahab and his family would be destroyed. The prophecy concerning Ahab’s children would be fulfilled in Jehu’s purging of Baal worshipers from Israel ([2 Kgs 9:30–37](https://ref.ly/2Kgs9:30-2Kgs9:37); [10:1–11](https://ref.ly/2Kgs10:1-2Kgs10:11)).

The author interrupts his account to reemphasize (see [16:30–34](https://ref.ly/1Kgs16:30-1Kgs16:34)) Ahab’s evil character, to denounce the king’s commitment to idolatry, and to condemn his weakness in allowing himself to be under the influence of his wife Jezebel. Wicked Jezebel would stop at nothing to achieve her own ends ([18:4](https://ref.ly/1Kgs18:4); [19:1–2](https://ref.ly/1Kgs19:1-1Kgs19:2); [21:5–10](https://ref.ly/1Kgs21:5-1Kgs21:10), [15](https://ref.ly/1Kgs21:15)). Though arrogant and defiant to the end ([2 Kgs 9:30–31](https://ref.ly/2Kgs9:30-2Kgs9:31)), she eventually met her predicted doom ([1 Kgs 21:23](https://ref.ly/1Kgs21:23); [2 Kgs 9:32–37](https://ref.ly/2Kgs9:32-2Kgs9:37)).

Ahab was a complex character. Although justly condemned for his evil character, here he repented when the Lord’s prophet brought a message of rebuke ([21:27](https://ref.ly/1Kgs21:27)). Because of Ahab’s repentance, the Lord sent Elijah to postpone the awful sentence against Ahab and instead impose it on his equally wicked sons ([2 Kgs 1:17](https://ref.ly/2Kgs1:17); [9:24–26](https://ref.ly/2Kgs9:24-2Kgs9:26); [10:1–11](https://ref.ly/2Kgs10:1-2Kgs10:11)).

three years … no war: During this time, the repeated westward thrusts of the Assyrian king Shalmaneser III (858–824 BC) led to the Battle of Qarqar (853 BC). Shalmaneser’s records mention that he faced both Hadadezer (Ben\-hadad) and Ahab at that battle. With the Assyrian king temporarily thwarted, old enmities between Aram and Israel flared up again.

However cordial Jehoshaphat may have intended his visit to be, he quickly became involved in Ahab’s plan to occupy Ramoth\-gilead. The Assyrian menace prevented Ahab from taking control of this key area that dominated the eastern end of the Plain of Jezreel. Now it needed to be taken by force, and Jehoshaphat placed his troops and horses at Ahab’s disposal.

Like God himself ([Ps 23](https://ref.ly/Ps23:1-Ps23:6); [Isa 40:10–11](https://ref.ly/Isa40:10-Isa40:11)), Israel’s kings and leaders were charged with care of the people much as a shepherd cares for his sheep ([Num 27:16–17](https://ref.ly/Num27:16-Num27:17); [Ezek 34:2](https://ref.ly/Ezek34:2), [11–16](https://ref.ly/Ezek34:11-Ezek34:16)). The motif of the shepherd and the sheep, applied to the coming Messiah ([Ezek 34:23–24](https://ref.ly/Ezek34:23-Ezek34:24)), was fulfilled in Christ the Good Shepherd ([John 10:1–11](https://ref.ly/John10:1-John10:11)).

Jehoshaphat built this fleet of trading ships in alliance with Ahaziah (see [2 Chr 20:35–37](https://ref.ly/2Chr20:35-2Chr20:37)). Like Solomon, the two kings planned to send a fleet to Ophir in search of gold ([1 Kgs 9:27–28](https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:27-1Kgs9:28); [10:11](https://ref.ly/1Kgs10:11)). The venture was ill\-fated; to fulfill a prophetic warning ([2 Chr 20:37](https://ref.ly/2Chr20:37)), the Lord destroyed the fleet before it left port. Jehoshaphat wisely did not become entangled with Ahaziah a second time. • Ezion\-geber was Solomon’s port city on the Gulf of Aqaba ([1 Kgs 9:26](https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:26)).

The tragic story of the rule of Ahaziah in Israel continues in [2 Kgs 1:1–18](https://ref.ly/2Kgs1:1-2Kgs1:18). He followed in the evil ways of his parents, Ahab and Jezebel ([1 Kgs 21:25–26](https://ref.ly/1Kgs21:25-1Kgs21:26)); he worshiped Baal ([2 Kgs 1:2](https://ref.ly/2Kgs1:2), [16](https://ref.ly/2Kgs1:16)) and supported the state religion instituted by Jeroboam I ([1 Kgs 12:28–32](https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:28-1Kgs12:32)). Ahaziah’s accession and statement of character provide closure to the account of Ahab in 1 Kings and a smooth transition to the continuing story of the divided kingdom in 2 Kings.
