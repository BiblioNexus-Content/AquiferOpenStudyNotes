--------------------------------

## Amos 1:1 (id: 9673)

message (literally *words*): This standard way of introducing a prophetic message ([Jer 1:1](https://ref.ly/Jer1:1); see also [Hag 1:12](https://ref.ly/Hag1:12)) emphasizes its form and content. • shepherd (Hebrew noqed): This word is used just one other time in the Old Testament, to describe the king of Moab as a “sheep breeder” ([2 Kgs 3:4](https://ref.ly/2Kgs3:4)). Amos describes his vocation in [Amos 7:14](https://ref.ly/Amos7:14) using a different Hebrew word (boqer, which means “herder”; see Amos Book Introduction, “The Prophet Amos”). Amos was not a professional prophet serving the court or the Temple. • Amos received this message in visions—that is, by divine revelation (see [Isa 1:1](https://ref.ly/Isa1:1)). • Amos depicts the earthquake that occurred during the reign of Uzziah ([Zech 14:5](https://ref.ly/Zech14:5)) as an act of God’s judgment ([Amos 3:14–15](https://ref.ly/Amos3:14-Amos3:15); [6:11](https://ref.ly/Amos6:11), [14](https://ref.ly/Amos6:14); [8:8](https://ref.ly/Amos8:8); [9:1](https://ref.ly/Amos9:1), [9](https://ref.ly/Amos9:9)). • Uzziah, also called Azariah (792–740 BC), was the most powerful king of Judah after the division of the kingdom. • Jeroboam II (793–753 BC), who descended from the dynasty of Jehu, took advantage of a power vacuum in the region and recovered territory earlier lost to the Arameans.

## Amos 1:2 (id: 9674)

This message speaks of judgment at the day of the Lord. • Mount Zion (the Temple in Jerusalem) was the logical source of a message from the Lord. • Mount Carmel rises from the Mediterranean Sea and is well watered even in time of drought. If all the grass on Mount Carmel withered, it would be the sign of a catastrophic drought.

## Amos 1:3 (id: 9677)

have sinned again and again: Literally *have committed three sins, even four.* This expression is used for a repeated act of rebellion against the natural order established by God. The Hebrew phrase does not denote a strict count but a pattern of repeated violations. • beat down my people: Threshing grain involved separating the heads of the grain from their hulls by pulling wooden sledges with sharp teeth over the cut grain ([Isa 41:15](https://ref.ly/Isa41:15); see [Mic 4:13](https://ref.ly/Mic4:13)). This description provides a graphic picture of the brutality of the people of Damascus.

* **Associated Passages:** AMO 1:3
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Amos 1:3–5 (id: 9676)

Damascus, the capital of Aram*,* was brutal in its treatment of the people of Gilead*,* Israel’s territory east of the Jordan. By the time Ahab died (853 BC), Damascus had captured Ramoth in Gilead ([1 Kgs 22:3](https://ref.ly/1Kgs22:3)). Around 801 BC, Assyria captured Damascus, and the city never again held the power it had wielded in its prime.

* **Associated Passages:** AMO 1:3–AMO 1:5
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Amos 1:3–2.16 (id: 9675)

The eight judgments of this prophecy proceed from the most obvious enemy, Damascus, to the least obvious, Israel itself. The sequence would have engaged Israel’s attention as they heard God’s judgment against their enemies, but Amos eventually confronted the people with God’s judgment on them.

* **Associated Passages:** AMO 1:3–AMO 2:16
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Amos 1:4 (id: 9678)

I will send down fire: In ancient times conquered cities were burned by invading armies (see also [1:7](https://ref.ly/Amos1:7), [10](https://ref.ly/Amos1:10), [12](https://ref.ly/Amos1:12), [14](https://ref.ly/Amos1:14); [2:2](https://ref.ly/Amos2:2), [5](https://ref.ly/Amos2:5)). The conquest of Damascus would be God’s judgment on them. • Hazael reigned as king of Damascus (about 843–802 BC) after he seized the throne by assassination. Ben\-hadad was Hazael’s son and successor (about 802–792 BC).

## Amos 1:5 (id: 9679)

Aven and Beth\-eden were both connected with Aram and Damascus. Aven (meaning *evil, wickedness*) refers to the valley between the Lebanon and Anti\-Lebanon mountains or the plain of Damascus. The city\-state Beth\-eden was north of Aram, elsewhere simply called *Eden* ([2 Kgs 19:12](https://ref.ly/2Kgs19:12); [Ezek 27:23](https://ref.ly/Ezek27:23)). • The Arameans originally came from Kir ([Amos 9:7](https://ref.ly/Amos9:7)), probably in southern Babylonia; Kir was where Assyria deported them when Damascus fell ([2 Kgs 16:9](https://ref.ly/2Kgs16:9)). Just as Egypt was a symbol of captivity for Israel (see [Deut 28:68](https://ref.ly/Deut28:68)), Kir represented captivity for Aram.

## Amos 1:6 (id: 9680)

The Philistine city of Gaza*,* on the seacoast at the southwest edge of Palestine, was the gateway for traffic between Africa and Asia. Its sin was slave trading; Philistia had raided Israel or Judah and sold whole villages into slavery to Edom.

* **Associated Passages:** AMO 1:6
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Amos 1:7 (id: 9681)

I will send down fire: Uzziah conquered Philistia ([2 Chr 26:6](https://ref.ly/2Chr26:6)); in 701 BC, the Assyrian invasion all but ended the distinct identity of the Philistines.

* **Associated Passages:** AMO 1:7
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Amos 1:8 (id: 9682)

The Philistine cities of Ashdod and Ashkelon were on or near the seacoast, while Ekron lay inland. Gath is not mentioned here, as it had been conquered earlier by Hazael ([2 Kgs 12:17](https://ref.ly/2Kgs12:17)) and then Uzziah ([2 Chr 26:6](https://ref.ly/2Chr26:6)). • the few Philistines still left: The Philistines maintained their ethnic identity through the Assyrian period, but this distinction faded by the time of the Persians ([Zech 9:5–7](https://ref.ly/Zech9:5-Zech9:7)).

* **Associated Passages:** AMO 1:8
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Amos 1:9 (id: 9683)

Tyre and Sidon were the principal seaports of Phoenicia. • Tyre’s crime, like Philistia’s ([1:6–8](https://ref.ly/Amos1:6-Amos1:8)), was selling whole villages of Israelite captives to the Edomites as slaves*,* a captivity made more bitter by a sense of betrayal (see [2 Sam 5:11](https://ref.ly/2Sam5:11); [1 Kgs 5:1](https://ref.ly/1Kgs5:1), [11](https://ref.ly/1Kgs5:11); [16:30–31](https://ref.ly/1Kgs16:30-1Kgs16:31)). Tyre’s reputation was “anything is for sale”; Isaiah portrayed the city as a prostitute peddling her wares ([Isa 23:15–17](https://ref.ly/Isa23:15-Isa23:17)).

fire on the walls: The main part of Tyre was built on an island, making it almost impossible to capture (see [Ezek 26:1–28:19](https://ref.ly/Ezek26:1-Ezek28:19)).

## Amos 1:11 (id: 9668)

Edom was another betrayer (see [1:9](https://ref.ly/Amos1:9); [Gen 36](https://ref.ly/Gen36:1-Gen36:43); see also [Gen 25:23–30](https://ref.ly/Gen25:23-Gen25:30); [27:39–40](https://ref.ly/Gen27:39-Gen27:40)). • The NLT adds the Israelites to make explicit what relatives (literally *brother*) means (see [Gen 25:25–30](https://ref.ly/Gen25:25-Gen25:30)). “Brothers” can also refer to parties to a treaty (see [Amos 1:9](https://ref.ly/Amos1:9)). Apparently Edom exerted constant pressure on the borders of Israel and Judah, raiding and plundering at moments of weakness ([Jer 49:7–22](https://ref.ly/Jer49:7-Jer49:22); [Obad 1:1–9](https://ref.ly/Obad1:1-Obad1:9)).

With the destruction of the major cities of Teman and Bozrah*,* Edom lost its capacity for continual warfare. Babylon destroyed Edom shortly after Judah in 553 BC (see [Jer 27](https://ref.ly/Jer27:1-Jer27:22); [49:7–22](https://ref.ly/Jer49:7-Jer49:22); see also study note on Obad 1:18).

## Amos 1:13 (id: 9670)

Israel regarded the people of Ammon as kin who also betrayed them. The Ammonites (like the Moabites, [2:1](https://ref.ly/Amos2:1)) were descendants of Lot, Abraham’s nephew ([Gen 19:37–38](https://ref.ly/Gen19:37-Gen19:38)). Ammon had been a constant threat to Gilead (see [Judg 10:7–9](https://ref.ly/Judg10:7-Judg10:9)). • In ancient times, conquering armies commonly ripped open pregnant women ([2 Kgs 8:12](https://ref.ly/2Kgs8:12); [15:16](https://ref.ly/2Kgs15:16); [Hos 13:16](https://ref.ly/Hos13:16)); they also raped the women and slaughtered the children of the towns they seized ([Isa 13:16](https://ref.ly/Isa13:16), [18](https://ref.ly/Isa13:18); [Lam 5:11](https://ref.ly/Lam5:11); [Hos 10:14](https://ref.ly/Hos10:14); [13:16](https://ref.ly/Hos13:16); [Nah 3:10](https://ref.ly/Nah3:10); [Zech 14:2](https://ref.ly/Zech14:2)).

## Amos 1:14 (id: 9671)

Rabbah was the chief city of the Ammonites ([2 Sam 12:26](https://ref.ly/2Sam12:26)). • Ammon ([Amos 1:13](https://ref.ly/Amos1:13)) was crushed by the Assyrians in the 800s BC, then attacked and depopulated by the Babylonians in the 700s.

their king: The Hebrew term malkam may be a reference to the Ammonite god Molech. In ancient times, people believed that a conquered nation’s god or gods went into exile together with them (see [5:26–27](https://ref.ly/Amos5:26-Amos5:27); [1 Sam 5:1–2](https://ref.ly/1Sam5:1-1Sam5:2); [Isa 46:1](https://ref.ly/Isa46:1)).

desecrated the bones: In some past skirmish, the Moabites had captured Edom’s king. Cremation was considered a form of desecration; if the ashes (literally *lime*) of the king were used in plaster, the insult would be compounded.

* **Associated Passages:** AMO 2:1

## Amos 2:2–3 (id: 9689)

Kerioth*,* a major town ([Jer 48:20–24](https://ref.ly/Jer48:20-Jer48:24)), is mentioned on the Moabite Stone as a shrine to Chemosh, Moab’s god. Perhaps the Moabites burned the remains of Edom’s king or offered him as a human sacrifice at this site. Because of the desecration of the Edomite king’s corpse, God would destroy the king of Moab and his officers. This fate probably came upon them through an invasion by Sargon II of Assyria (715/713 BC; cp. [Isa 15–16](https://ref.ly/Isa15:1-Isa16:14)). Josephus (*Antiquities* 10\.9\.7\) implies a further destruction in 582 BC (see also [Jer 48](https://ref.ly/Jer48:1-Jer48:47); [Ezek 25:8–11](https://ref.ly/Ezek25:8-Ezek25:11); [Zeph 2:8–11](https://ref.ly/Zeph2:8-Zeph2:11)).

## Amos 2:4 (id: 9691)

rejected the instruction (Hebrew torah) of the Lord: The pagan nations listed to this point had committed atrocities that violated a general sense of human decency, but Judah had gone further; they held the word of God and yet had rejected its teachings (see [Hos 4:6](https://ref.ly/Hos4:6); [8:1](https://ref.ly/Hos8:1)). God holds people responsible in proportion to the privilege they have received (see [Amos 3:2](https://ref.ly/Amos3:2)). • led astray by the same lies: Having discarded God’s true instruction, Judah turned to a substitute found in pagan syncretism (the combining of elements from different belief systems) and idolatry (see [1 Kgs 14:22–24](https://ref.ly/1Kgs14:22-1Kgs14:24)).

## Amos 2:4–5 (id: 9690)

The southern kingdom of Judah was closest to the northern kingdom of Israel in blood ties and geography, but bitterness existed between the nations. The north regarded the descendants of David in the south as abusive kings who had caused the schism by their forced labor and heavy taxes.

## Amos 2:5 (id: 9692)

Judah’s paganism brought the same punishment as the sins of its pagan neighbors: fire ([1:4](https://ref.ly/Amos1:4), [7](https://ref.ly/Amos1:7), [10](https://ref.ly/Amos1:10), [12](https://ref.ly/Amos1:12), [14](https://ref.ly/Amos1:14); [2:2](https://ref.ly/Amos2:2)) that would destroy Jerusalem. The Babylonians burned Jerusalem when they captured it in 586 BC (see [2 Kgs 25:9](https://ref.ly/2Kgs25:9); [Neh 2:17](https://ref.ly/Neh2:17); [4:2](https://ref.ly/Neh4:2)).

## Amos 2:6 (id: 9694)

Honorable people are the “righteous,” those who enjoyed a right relationship with God and other people. The parallel with poor people creates the idea of the “righteous needy.” The law of Moses urged those who had much to help those in need by lending freely ([Deut 15:7–11](https://ref.ly/Deut15:7-Deut15:11)). As a last resort, those too poor to pay their debts could become bond servants to repay their debts through labor ([Lev 25:39–43](https://ref.ly/Lev25:39-Lev25:43)). These righteous needy were being sold into bond servitude for a pair of sandals*,* a hyperbole for the pittance they owed (see [Amos 8:6](https://ref.ly/Amos8:6)). The sandals were a pledge given for the debt or a token used to seal a bargain (see [Ruth 4:7](https://ref.ly/Ruth4:7)).

Israel: After leading the people through a litany of sins committed by Israel’s neighbors, Amos arrived at his real point: The Israelites would suffer a similar fate (cp. Nathan’s use of prophetic rhetoric to induce self\-indictment, [2 Sam 12:1–13](https://ref.ly/2Sam12:1-2Sam12:13)).

## Amos 2:7 (id: 9695)

To trample … people was to treat them ruthlessly (see also [8:4](https://ref.ly/Amos8:4)). • The helpless and oppressed were people exploited by a socio\-economic system that denied them the justice guaranteed by law ([Exod 23:6–8](https://ref.ly/Exod23:6-Exod23:8)). • That father and son sleep with the same woman demonstrated the moral destitution of the Israelites; the law of Moses prohibited this practice ([Lev 18:7–8](https://ref.ly/Lev18:7-Lev18:8), [15](https://ref.ly/Lev18:15); [20:11–12](https://ref.ly/Lev20:11-Lev20:12)). • corrupting my holy name: In worshiping various fertility gods, Israel and surrounding nations engaged in “sacred prostitution” (see [Hos 4:10–14](https://ref.ly/Hos4:10-Hos4:14)). Sexual relations with a shrine prostitute were thought to ensure plentiful crops and thriving herds of livestock. This verse suggests that these acts were performed in the name of the Lord. When performed as religious rituals, these corrupt actions treat God’s name as worthless.

## Amos 2:8 (id: 9696)

The irony is that the oppressors of the poor flaunted their sins at religious festivals. • The Torah allowed a lender to take a poor man’s cloak as security for a debt, but it was not to be kept overnight, because the nights were cold ([Exod 22:26–27](https://ref.ly/Exod22:26-Exod22:27); [Deut 24:12–13](https://ref.ly/Deut24:12-Deut24:13)). A widow’s clothing was never to be taken as security for a debt ([Deut 24:17](https://ref.ly/Deut24:17)). • unjust fines: The wealthy bribed judges and used their influence to keep the poor, who could not defend themselves, from obtaining a fair hearing ([Amos 5:12](https://ref.ly/Amos5:12)).

In addition to priests, God provided prophets to speak his word and will ([Deut 18:15–19](https://ref.ly/Deut18:15-Deut18:19)) and holy men called Nazirites*,* who were dedicated to the Lord by vows that included abstention from fermented drinks ([Num 6:1–21](https://ref.ly/Num6:1-Num6:21)). Israel showed its disregard for God by telling both the Nazirites and the prophets to ignore and violate God’s calling (see [Amos 7:12–13](https://ref.ly/Amos7:12-Amos7:13)).

## Amos 3:2 (id: 9707)

The word translated been intimate indicates personal and experiential knowledge that often extends beyond mere intellectual awareness. It can indicate formal recognition and acknowledgment ([Exod 1:8](https://ref.ly/Exod1:8); [5:2](https://ref.ly/Exod5:2)), personal experience ([Gen 2:17](https://ref.ly/Gen2:17)), or sexual relations ([Gen 4:1](https://ref.ly/Gen4:1)). This word is frequently used of God’s relationship with Israel ([Hos 5:3](https://ref.ly/Hos5:3)) and of Israel’s ideal relationship with God ([Hos 2:20](https://ref.ly/Hos2:20)). Because of Israel’s privileged status, God would hold them accountable for all their sins, not just some of them. God holds people accountable in terms of what has been given them ([Luke 12:47–48](https://ref.ly/Luke12:47-Luke12:48)).

The prophet now turns to two of Israel’s enemies, Philistia (Hebrew *Ashdod,* one of the key cities of Philistia) and Egypt. He invites them to surround Samaria (the capital of the kingdom of Israel) to see its chaos and oppression. Israel appeared strong from the outside, but it was rotten within, rife with class struggles. The enemies would take advantage of Israel’s internal weakness (see [3:11](https://ref.ly/Amos3:11)).

A shepherd who tries to rescue: The people of both Israel and Judah believed that, because of their chosen status, God would intervene to rescue them and never let them perish. The prophet’s words are ironic: Their rescue would be like a shepherd who arrives too late to save the sheep, and who can pull only two legs or a piece of an ear from the mouth of the lion. • So it will be … reclining on couches: Some have interpreted this statement to mean that only the fabric of a few couches would survive the Assyrian siege of Samaria. Accordingly, the last two lines of this verse could be translated *So it will be when the Israelites in Samaria are rescued / with only a broken bed and a tattered pillow.*

pagan altars at Bethel: The shrine at Bethel, built by Jeroboam I shortly after his inauguration ([1 Kgs 12:26–33](https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:26-1Kgs12:33)), continued through the dynasty of Jehu ([2 Kgs 10:29](https://ref.ly/2Kgs10:29)), from whom Jeroboam II descended. This shrine merged worship of Yahweh (the Lord) with the pagan symbol of a bull. When the altars were destroyed, the Bethel shrine, the king’s official sanctuary ([Amos 7:13](https://ref.ly/Amos7:13)), and the northern kingdom would also be ruined.

Amos uses the feminine form (cows) to paint a picture of Israel’s upper class wives, who cared little for the poor.

Amos lampoons the Israelites’ worthless piety. • Bethel*,* the site of Jacob’s famous vision of the ladder with angels descending and ascending ([Gen 28:11–22](https://ref.ly/Gen28:11-Gen28:22)), was the southern seat of the religion established by Jeroboam I (see [Amos 3:14](https://ref.ly/Amos3:14); [1 Kgs 12:28–29](https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:28-1Kgs12:29)). Gilgal*,* Israel’s campsite after they crossed the Jordan ([Josh 4:19–5:9](https://ref.ly/Josh4:19-Josh5:9)), had become a popular shrine by the time of Amos and Hosea ([Hos 4:15](https://ref.ly/Hos4:15); [9:15](https://ref.ly/Hos9:15); [12:11](https://ref.ly/Hos12:11)). • sacrifices each morning … tithes every three days: Israelite males were to appear before the Lord at the sanctuary three times each year ([Exod 23:14–19](https://ref.ly/Exod23:14-Exod23:19); [34:23](https://ref.ly/Exod34:23); [Deut 16:16–17](https://ref.ly/Deut16:16-Deut16:17)). Tithes were typically paid annually ([Deut 14:22–29](https://ref.ly/Deut14:22-Deut14:29)), with a special tithe paid every three years (see [Deut 14:28](https://ref.ly/Deut14:28); [26:12](https://ref.ly/Deut26:12)). Amos is making the point that the Israelites were religious to the point of absurdity, but they balked at being godly ([Amos 5:15](https://ref.ly/Amos5:15); [Hos 6:6](https://ref.ly/Hos6:6); [Mic 6:8](https://ref.ly/Mic6:8); see [Luke 11:42](https://ref.ly/Luke11:42)).

Leavened bread (that is, sourdough fermented by wild yeast) was for daily consumption. The more primitive unleavened bread (made without yeast) became a sacred symbol, commemorating Israel’s affliction as slaves in Egypt ([Deut 16:3](https://ref.ly/Deut16:3)), the Passover ([Exod 12:17–20](https://ref.ly/Exod12:17-Exod12:20)), and their hasty departure from that land ([Exod 12:34](https://ref.ly/Exod12:34), [39](https://ref.ly/Exod12:39)). Unleavened bread thus became altar bread ([Lev 6:17](https://ref.ly/Lev6:17); [7:12](https://ref.ly/Lev7:12)).

Amos again confronts the Israelites’ distorted view of their chosen status (see [3:2](https://ref.ly/Amos3:2)). • The phrase What sorrow awaits you denotes despair brought on by a great tragedy. • The day of the Lord in the Old Testament (see [Isa 13:6](https://ref.ly/Isa13:6), [9](https://ref.ly/Isa13:9)) was a time when God would intervene in the world to set right those things that had gone wrong. God’s intervention would mean vindication for the righteous, but judgment for the wicked. Israel thought that on that day (see also [Amos 8:3](https://ref.ly/Amos8:3), [9](https://ref.ly/Amos8:9), [13](https://ref.ly/Amos8:13); [9:11](https://ref.ly/Amos9:11)) God would save them. However, because the Israelites had been wicked, the day of the Lord would bring darkness, not light. Assyria conquered the northern kingdom in 722 BC ([2 Kgs 17:7–23](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:7-2Kgs17:23)), fulfilling this prophecy.

The word translated you served may mean *you will lift up*, in which case the prophet is making a contrast between Israel or Judah, who carried their idols, and God, who carries his people (see [Isa 46:1–7](https://ref.ly/Isa46:1-Isa46:7)).

pagan shrines … temples: Every vestige of the apostate Israelite religion, from the common high places to the royal shrine at Bethel, would be destroyed. • of your ancestors (literally *of Isaac*): Isaac stands for Israel’s ancestors, the fathers of the nation. • dynasty of King Jeroboam: Jeroboam II died of natural causes ([2 Kgs 14:29](https://ref.ly/2Kgs14:29)), but the murder of his son and successor, Zechariah, after a reign of less than a year ([2 Kgs 15:8–10](https://ref.ly/2Kgs15:8-2Kgs15:10); see [2 Kgs 10:28–31](https://ref.ly/2Kgs10:28-2Kgs10:31)), initiated instability in Israel’s government that it never overcame ([2 Kgs 15:10–31](https://ref.ly/2Kgs15:10-2Kgs15:31)).

Amaziah misinterpreted Amos’s words as a threat on Jeroboam’s life. Amos was calling the people to repentance, not sedition.

Amos was not a professional prophet or even a disciple in training. He had no financial incentive to leave his livelihood in order to prophesy. • shepherd: The Hebrew word here is not the same as in [1:1](https://ref.ly/Amos1:1) and is not found elsewhere in the Old Testament. It is related to a word for cattle, suggesting that Amos may have raised cattle as a breeder or herder (see Amos Book Introduction, “The Prophet Amos”). • The sycamore\-fig was gathered for cattle feed.

Work was explicitly forbidden on the Sabbath day ([Exod 20:9–10](https://ref.ly/Exod20:9-Exod20:10)); Amos implies that shops were closed during pagan new\-moon religious festivals as well. • Merchants were cheating their customers by measuring grain with small ephahs and cheating their suppliers by using heavy shekels on the scales. This practice was forbidden by God’s law ([Lev 19:35–36](https://ref.ly/Lev19:35-Lev19:36); [Deut 25:13–16](https://ref.ly/Deut25:13-Deut25:16); see [Prov 11:1](https://ref.ly/Prov11:1); [16:11](https://ref.ly/Prov16:11); [20:10](https://ref.ly/Prov20:10), [23](https://ref.ly/Prov20:23)).

the Pride of Israel: The same Hebrew phrase alludes in [6:8](https://ref.ly/Amos6:8) to Israel’s arrogance. Here, the phrase is probably a name for God, who is the legitimate object of Israel’s pride. Elsewhere ([Ps 47:4](https://ref.ly/Ps47:4); [Nah 2:2](https://ref.ly/Nah2:2)), this phrase refers to the Promised Land under a king from David’s line (cp. [Jer 13:9](https://ref.ly/Jer13:9); [Ezek 32:12](https://ref.ly/Ezek32:12)). If the phrase here means the land, it would spotlight Israel’s perverse pride in its national and geographic identity.

The day of the Lord would invert the cosmos.

famine … of hearing the words of the Lord: God sent prophets to Israel to speak his words directly to them, but Israel commanded the prophets not to prophesy ([2:11–12](https://ref.ly/Amos2:11-Amos2:12)). Now they had what they wanted, but it was a silence more terrible than his roar and thunder: God became distant (see [Ezek 7:26](https://ref.ly/Ezek7:26); [20:3](https://ref.ly/Ezek20:3); [Mic 3:4](https://ref.ly/Mic3:4), [7](https://ref.ly/Mic3:7)).

The god of Dan refers to the northern shrine of the gold calf established by Jeroboam I (see [1 Kgs 12:28–29](https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:28-1Kgs12:29); [2 Kgs 10:29](https://ref.ly/2Kgs10:29)). • the god of Beersheba: Evidently Beersheba had become a center of worship in the southern kingdom.

I saw … the Lord (see [7:1](https://ref.ly/Amos7:1)): God ceased to reveal how or why he would punish Israel; he was now poised to act. • beside the altar: Judgment must begin with the center of worship (cp.

God is inescapable (cp. [Ps 139:7–12](https://ref.ly/Ps139:7-Ps139:12)). When people trust, believe, and obey God, his inescapability is a great blessing. But because Israel rejected God’s revelation, his presence would mean judgment, not comfort.

Though Mount Carmel is not the highest mountain in the region, its lofty grandeur often represents the beauty and richness of the land. • sea serpent: In the ancient Near East, the sea was a symbol of chaos, often pitted against the national god (cp. [Pss 74:14](https://ref.ly/Ps74:14); [89:10](https://ref.ly/Ps89:10); [104:26](https://ref.ly/Ps104:26)). However, the biblical text does not grant divine status to the sea monster (“Leviathan,” also called “Rahab”; [Ps 89:9–10](https://ref.ly/Ps89:9-Ps89:10)) but sees it as subject to the Lord’s command and judgment ([Isa 27:1](https://ref.ly/Isa27:1)). Here, Amos portrays God’s sovereign power to summon the sea serpent to his service.

the Ethiopians (literally *the Cushites*): Cush (see [Gen 10:6–7](https://ref.ly/Gen10:6-Gen10:7)) was south of the Second Cataract of the Nile (cp. [Isa 18:1](https://ref.ly/Isa18:1)) and was often linked with Egypt*,* its neighbor to the north. • Israel’s exodus out of Egypt is compared to two other ancient migrations: the Philistines from Crete (see also [Jer 47:4](https://ref.ly/Jer47:4)) and the Arameans out of Kir (cp. [Amos 1:5](https://ref.ly/Amos1:5); [2 Kgs 16:9](https://ref.ly/2Kgs16:9)).

As the prophets often did, Amos closes his litany of judgments with a message of hope and restoration. Though Jerusalem and its Temple would be destroyed, David’s line of kings cut off ([Ps 89:38–51](https://ref.ly/Ps89:38-Ps89:51)), and its people taken into captivity, God would restore a remnant of Israel (see also [Isa 2:2–4](https://ref.ly/Isa2:2-Isa2:4); [4:2](https://ref.ly/Isa4:2); [11:1–5](https://ref.ly/Isa11:1-Isa11:5)).

Edom (see [1:11](https://ref.ly/Amos1:11)) represents the enemies of God and of Israel (see [Isa 34:5–6](https://ref.ly/Isa34:5-Isa34:6), [11](https://ref.ly/Isa34:11); [63:1](https://ref.ly/Isa63:1)). In the time of restoration, God’s enemies are subject to his people and to God himself. • the nations I have called: God promised Abraham that he would be a blessing to all the people of the earth ([Gen 12:2–3](https://ref.ly/Gen12:2-Gen12:3)). God’s kingdom would embrace the outcasts and foreigners previously excluded ([Isa 56](https://ref.ly/Isa56:1-Isa56:12); see [Acts 8:27–39](https://ref.ly/Acts8:27-Acts8:39)).
