## Numbers 1:1 (id: 22602)

In the year after Israel’s departure from Egypt, the Lord frequently communicated his will to the people through Moses and gave them every opportunity to conform to his divine plan. • God’s self\-disclosure often took place at the Tabernacle (literally *the Tent of Meeting*; see study note on Exod 27:21). • The wilderness of Sinai was a great, terrifying, and inhospitable desert ([Deut 1:19](https://ref.ly/Deut1:19)). This relatively unpopulated region was the anvil on which God forged Israel as the environmental challenges of Sinai tested Israel’s dependence upon the Lord throughout the book of Numbers. Sinai reminded later biblical authors of the law and of Israel’s rebellious spirit ([Ps 106:19](https://ref.ly/Ps106:19); [Heb 12:25–26](https://ref.ly/Heb12:25-Heb12:26)).

They might reflect the literal size of this army (cp. [Exod 1:9–10](https://ref.ly/Exod1:9-Exod1:10)); alternatively, the figures might be symbolic, projected backward from a later period, or simply misunderstood in translation.

Israel’s camps were to be organized by tribal groupings. This arrangement may have reflected concerns for social status, access to water, and security for the Tabernacle, which represented the Lord’s presence. The Egyptian army from approximately this same era camped in a similar defensive formation to protect the sacred objects that accompanied their field campaigns.

Each area of the Hebrew camp was identified by family banners*,* which were probably flags or streamers ([1:52](https://ref.ly/Num1:52)). The use of such tribal symbols or battle flags finds an analogy in modern bedouin life, where the divisions of tribe, clan, and family have long held great importance. • The tribes camped around the sanctuary at a safe distance (cp.

This first phase of a two\-stage registration of the tribe of Levi (see [4:34–49](https://ref.ly/Num4:34-Num4:49) for stage two) summarized each family group’s special responsibilities (described in greater detail in [4:1–33](https://ref.ly/Num4:1-Num4:33)). This numbering was not linked with military duties, so it enrolled male Levites from the age of one month ([3:40–41](https://ref.ly/Num3:40-Num3:41)). • Three family groups are descended from Gershon, Kohath, and Merari, the three sons of Levi. These clans (often called the Gershonites, Kohathites, and Merarites) later inherited the “cities of refuge” ([Josh 21](https://ref.ly/Josh21:1-Josh21:45)) and filled various important posts in the Jerusalem Temple ([2 Chr 29:3–17](https://ref.ly/2Chr29:3-2Chr29:17)).

Aaron and Moses, sons of Amram, were descendants of Kohath (see [Exod 6:18](https://ref.ly/Exod6:18), [20](https://ref.ly/Exod6:20), [26](https://ref.ly/Exod6:26)). Because they were caretakers of the sanctuary (the Most Holy Place) and its very sacred furnishings (described in [Num 3–4](https://ref.ly/Num3:1-Num4:49)), the Kohathites were the most highly regarded of the three clans.

He played an important role in Israel’s wilderness period and later succeeded his father as high priest (see [16:37–39](https://ref.ly/Num16:37-Num16:39); [19:3–6](https://ref.ly/Num19:3-Num19:6); [20:25–28](https://ref.ly/Num20:25-Num20:28); [26:1–3](https://ref.ly/Num26:1-Num26:3)).

## Numbers 3:40–51 (id: 22881)

There were 273 more firstborn sons in Israel from the non\-Levite tribes than there were Levite males (compare [Leviticus 3:39](https://ref.ly/Num3:39)). The Levites acted as substitutes for Israel's firstborn sons ([3:41](https://ref.ly/Num3:41); see study note on 3:11–13). The law required a redemption price of five pieces of silver for each extra firstborn son ([Numbers 3:46–48](https://ref.ly/Num3:46-Num3:48); compare [Leviticus 27:6](https://ref.ly/Lev27:6)). 

It is unclear who paid this cost. This arrangement for special substitutes points to Christ’s role as a substitute. Through his death, Christ paid the redemption price for all humanity (see [Mark 10:45](https://ref.ly/Mark10:45); [Galatians 3:13](https://ref.ly/Gal3:13); [Ephesians 1:7](https://ref.ly/Eph1:7); [Hebrews 9:15](https://ref.ly/Heb9:15)).

This section expands the discussion begun in [3:21–37](https://ref.ly/Num3:21-Num3:37) on the duties of the three clans of Levites. The Levites—on the march and encamped—carried and cared for the Tabernacle and were always surrounded by the other tribes so that they and their precious cargo would be safe ([2:17](https://ref.ly/Num2:17)). The sacred things associated with God were placed in the middle of the tribes, and the role of the priests and their Levitical assistants was to keep them holy by keeping them separate. • God, in his holiness, is worthy of attention to the details of his will. His Tabernacle and its furnishings were sacred, and the tribe of Levi was responsible to maintain the distinction between holy and common, between clean and unclean. This explains why so much information is provided about the duties of the three clans of Levites.

Of the 22,000 Levites ([3:39](https://ref.ly/Num3:39)), only men between the ages of thirty and fifty*,* those in the prime of their life, were allowed to serve in the sanctuary. The summary of this registration (another “numbering”) found in [4:34–49](https://ref.ly/Num4:34-Num4:49) gives the total number of qualified males as 8,580\.

The duties of the Kohathites (see [3:27–32](https://ref.ly/Num3:27-Num3:32)) are listed first because they performed a special service related to the most sacred objects (perhaps because Aaron and the priests came from this clan; [1 Chr 6:2–3](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:2-1Chr6:3)). The tasks of carrying, setting up, and disassembling these sacred coverings and furnishings were extremely important. All the things entrusted to Kohath’s descendants—the Ark of the Covenant*,* the table of the Bread of the Presence*,* the lampstand (Hebrew menorah), the gold incense altar*,* and the altar for sacrifices—held tremendous value. These objects are first described in [Exod 25–30](https://ref.ly/Exod25:1-Exod30:38), but Numbers shows how they were integrated into Hebrew life. The Kohathites carried these items on poles or in frames, and they were not to touch them or enter the sanctuary to look at them on penalty of death.

Aaron and his surviving sons Eleazar and Ithamar had to cover the sanctuary and all the sacred articles completely before the camp was ready to move*,* with the groups of non\-Levitical tribes marching before and behind the Levites who carried the Tabernacle. The royalty of these objects is seen in the symbolic colors of the coverings, and their sacredness underlies the stern warning that even though the Kohathites were the designated handlers, they must not touch the sacred objects, or they would die. Such respect marked the holiness of Israel’s Lord. The dangers of disregarding these instructions are apparent in [1 Sam 6:19–20](https://ref.ly/1Sam6:19-1Sam6:20) and [2 Sam 6:6–7](https://ref.ly/2Sam6:6-2Sam6:7).

The men of the Gershonite clan (see [3:21–26](https://ref.ly/Num3:21-Num3:26)) were responsible for general service and carrying loads ([4:24](https://ref.ly/Num4:24)). This involved handling the curtains and coverings, ropes, and related equipment that was less central to Israel’s worship. Their duties focused on the Tabernacle in general instead of on the sacred objects of the inner sanctuary that were the responsibility of Kohath’s clan.

Even this assignment to the Merarite clan, which focused on items of lesser priority than those handled by the Kohathites and Gershonites, had to be done in a specific way, and the various loads were assigned to each man by name ([4:32](https://ref.ly/Num4:32); cp. [1 Cor 14:40](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:40)). While the Gershonites and Merarites lacked the status of Kohath’s family, each group contributed to the process of moving and erecting the Tabernacle.

* Modern Western people may find it difficult to understand the Old Testament laws of purity. Today, things like skin diseases, bodily discharges, or contact with a dead body are viewed mainly as health concerns. But in the Old Testament, the main concern was protecting God’s holiness from ceremonial uncleanness (see [Leviticus 11–15](https://ref.ly/Lev11:1-Lev15:33)).

    The community had to keep the camp holy. Nothing unclean could touch what belonged to the Lord ([Numbers 5:2–3](https://ref.ly/Num5:2-Num5:3)). They had to choose between having God in the camp or allowing a ceremonially polluted person stay. Both could not remain ([5:3](https://ref.ly/Num5:3)).

* The importance of purity continues from Leviticus and Numbers to the book of Revelation. Nothing ceremonially unclean will enter the New Jerusalem where God lives (see study note on Revelation 21:27). In the New Testament, impurity most often refers to what is morally impure ([Acts 10:28](https://ref.ly/Acts10:28); [Ephesians 5:5](https://ref.ly/Eph5:5); [1 Thessalonians 2:3](https://ref.ly/1Thess2:3); [4:7](https://ref.ly/1Thess4:7)).

This detailed test for adultery, a “trial by ordeal,” is the only such case found in the Old Testament, though trial by ordeal was a common procedure in the ancient Near East. God had a special interest in safeguarding marriage as the foundation of Hebrew society, and the purpose of this ordeal was to promote marital faithfulness. We cannot determine how commonly such ordeals actually occurred. This procedure appealed to God’s own intervention to ensure justice in cases lacking evidence (cp. [1 Cor 5:5](https://ref.ly/1Cor5:5)).

As the trial by ordeal is summarized and justified, it is clear that a husband’s questions about his wife’s guilt or innocence did not burden him with any guilt. We might raise the question of a double standard, but it was very common for ancient laws to draw attention to the woman’s failure in the matter of adultery. However, Israel’s legal system provided for the punishment of both parties to an affair (as in [Lev 20:10](https://ref.ly/Lev20:10); [Deut 22:21–22](https://ref.ly/Deut22:21-Deut22:22)).

The voluntary Nazirite vow allowed men or women to set themselves apart for the Lord. There was considerable variation in how the Nazirite lifestyle was practiced in various periods of Hebrew history. Vows were taken very seriously in ancient times as a well\-established means of expressing devotion or gratitude to God. This vow could be temporary or permanent; it involved refraining from alcoholic drinks, hair cutting, and contact with corpses. Nazirite restrictions gave members of non\-Levitical tribes a way to enter into a more demanding and highly respected relationship with God. The Nazirite vow is probably best known because of Samson ([Judg 13–16](https://ref.ly/Judg13:1-Judg16:31)). See also [1 Sam 1:11](https://ref.ly/1Sam1:11); [Jer 35](https://ref.ly/Jer35:1-Jer35:19); [Acts 18:8](https://ref.ly/Acts18:8); [21:23–26](https://ref.ly/Acts21:23-Acts21:26); cp.

This useful arrangement allowed time for the Gershonites and Merarites to set up the Tabernacle before the Kohathites arrived with the sacred objects.

By contrast, this group of seventy … elders would provide Israel with spiritual guidance. They needed a share of God’s Spirit that already rested upon Moses and made him the Lord’s special spokesman.

Chapters [1–14](https://ref.ly/Num1:1-Num14:45) took place in a relatively short period of time, but ch [15](https://ref.ly/Num15:1-Num15:41) describes the beginning of a long period—the bulk of the forty years in the wilderness—about which relatively little is known, though there are references to events that took place during the wilderness wanderings (e.g., [Deut 8:2–6](https://ref.ly/Deut8:2-Deut8:6); [29:5–6](https://ref.ly/Deut29:5-Deut29:6); [Josh 5:4–8](https://ref.ly/Josh5:4-Josh5:8); [Ezek 20:10–26](https://ref.ly/Ezek20:10-Ezek20:26); [Amos 5:25–26](https://ref.ly/Amos5:25-Amos5:26); [Acts 7:42–43](https://ref.ly/Acts7:42-Acts7:43)). During this period, Moses continued to deliver legislation to govern Israelite society, especially for that day when survivors of the wilderness would finally enter the Promised Land. This chapter deals with three categories of legal matters. Presented in the middle of stories about a stubborn and disobedient Israel, [Num 15](https://ref.ly/Num15:1-Num15:41) raises hope that the Promised Land still awaited Israel’s descendants.

Though there was no question about the man’s guilt, it is possible that the community was uncertain how to punish him. The death sentence was an appropriate penalty, because disregard of the Sabbath signaled a rejection of God’s gracious covenant with Israel ([Exod 31:12–17](https://ref.ly/Exod31:12-Exod31:17)) and was akin to blasphemy ([Num 15:30](https://ref.ly/Num15:30); [Lev 24:10–16](https://ref.ly/Lev24:10-Lev24:16); cp.

Another rebellion called for a clear delineation of the duties of priests and Levites. This power struggle was a more serious challenge than any of the previous rebellions against God’s authority (ch [11](https://ref.ly/Num11:1-Num11:35); [12:1–15](https://ref.ly/Num12:1-Num12:15); [14:1–45](https://ref.ly/Num14:1-Num14:45)).

Instead of reverently obeying God’s instructions, Moses rebuked the people (Must we bring you water from this rock?) and angrily struck the rock twice with the staff ([20:11](https://ref.ly/Num20:11)). God regarded Moses’ words and actions as a serious breach of faith; Moses “spoke foolishly” ([Ps 106:32–33](https://ref.ly/Ps106:32-Ps106:33); cp. [Jas 1:20](https://ref.ly/Jas1:20)) and did not trust God enough to demonstrate his holiness. By not doing exactly as he was told, Moses demonstrated a lack of faith in God to provide for his people. This lack of faith is also apparent in Moses’ words to the people. The Lord requires obedience and faith; anything less is an affront to his holy character ([Num 20:24](https://ref.ly/Num20:24); [27:14](https://ref.ly/Num27:14)).

It is possible that the Canaanite king of Arad was provoked by many enemies to the south of his territory (cp.

Ancient *Arad* is usually identified with Tell Arad, located west of the modern Israeli town of Arad and about fifty miles north of Kadesh. While excavation at Tell Arad has revealed important ruins from the Early Bronze Age (about 3300–2000 BC) and the Iron Age (about 1200–500 BC), there is no evidence of occupation during Israel’s exodus and wilderness period (the Late Bronze Age, 1500–1200 BC). Some solutions link ancient Arad with another archaeological site in the region. Others claim that all such stories come from a much later period and that there is no reason to expect a correlation between excavated data and literary traditions. Another set of solutions recognizes that the evidence is fragmentary, insufficient to settle scholarly debate or to reach a definitive conclusion. The same general kinds of problems with geographical and archaeological details are found in other parts of the Old Testament, and the solutions are often uncertain. • Atharim is otherwise unknown.

[Num 21:18](https://ref.ly/Num21:18), [23](https://ref.ly/Num21:23)) before arriving at Pisgah ([21:20](https://ref.ly/Num21:20)), this account is probably a flashback of something that took place before the movement described in [21:18–20](https://ref.ly/Num21:18-Num21:20).

King Sihon of the Amorites had taken the area north of the Arnon from the Moabites, who earlier controlled it.

This ancient ballad was apparently an old Amorite song focusing on the exploits of King Sihon.

The logical flow of thought from [21:26](https://ref.ly/Num21:26) to [21:27](https://ref.ly/Num21:27) would favor the former interpretation, with Israel applying the song to their own victory: Sihon and the Amorites had defeated Moab; now Israel had defeated them!

Balaam was a pagan religious specialist (a *diviner*) from northwest Mesopotamia (see “Balaam” Profile). Like other ancient peoples, Moab and Midian believed that the spoken word—in the form of a blessing or curse—was powerful when uttered by a skilled diviner. Members of this trained profession claimed to possess special powers to learn about and manipulate the future course of events (see [Deut 18:14](https://ref.ly/Deut18:14); [1 Sam 6:2](https://ref.ly/1Sam6:2); [2 Kgs 21:6](https://ref.ly/2Kgs21:6); [Isa 44:25](https://ref.ly/Isa44:25); [Dan 2:1–12](https://ref.ly/Dan2:1-Dan2:12), [27–28](https://ref.ly/Dan2:27-Dan2:28); [Mic 5:12](https://ref.ly/Mic5:12); [Zech 10:2](https://ref.ly/Zech10:2)). Israel’s enemies appealed to Balaam to pronounce curses upon the Hebrews, for they believed that such spoken words would be effective against them. Ancient armies pronounced such curses on their enemies before they entered battle. Belief in the power of the spoken word was common in ancient Israel even when not linked with divination (e.g., [Gen 27:1–40](https://ref.ly/Gen27:1-Gen27:40); [Deut 27:15–26](https://ref.ly/Deut27:15-Deut27:26); [1 Sam 14:24–28](https://ref.ly/1Sam14:24-1Sam14:28); cp. [Matt 21:18–22](https://ref.ly/Matt21:18-Matt21:22)). • Pethor ([Num 22:5](https://ref.ly/Num22:5)) is probably ancient Pitru, located on the west side of the Euphrates River south of Carchemish, 400 miles from Moab.

Such practices were banned from Israel (see [Deut 18:9–14](https://ref.ly/Deut18:9-Deut18:14); cp. [Ezek 21:21](https://ref.ly/Ezek21:21)).

A star was a symbol for a king (cp. [Isa 14:12](https://ref.ly/Isa14:12); [Matt 2:1–10](https://ref.ly/Matt2:1-Matt2:10)), and a scepter was an image of power and majesty (cp. [Gen 49:10](https://ref.ly/Gen49:10); [Ps 45:6](https://ref.ly/Ps45:6)). King David fits the description historically. The Moabites, whose defeat is mentioned in [Num 24:17](https://ref.ly/Num24:17), were among the many peoples conquered during his reign ([2 Sam 8:2](https://ref.ly/2Sam8:2)), though Moab remained a dangerous enemy of Israel after David’s time (cp.

Christians identify Jesus of Nazareth with a star (cp.

Baal of Peor might refer to Chemosh ([21:29](https://ref.ly/Num21:29)) by a different name, but probably Baal (“lord”), the Canaanite god, was included on the list of deities honored by the Moabites. Numerous place\-names were formed with this deity’s name (e.g., Baal\-gad, Baal\-hermon, Baal\-meon, Baal\-peor), representing shrines for local manifestations of Baal. Peor was a mountain from which Balaam could see the Israelite camp in the plains of Moab; the mountain and the related shrine of Beth\-peor ([23:28](https://ref.ly/Num23:28); [25:3](https://ref.ly/Num25:3), [5](https://ref.ly/Num25:5), [18](https://ref.ly/Num25:18); [31:16](https://ref.ly/Num31:16); [Deut 3:29](https://ref.ly/Deut3:29); [4:3](https://ref.ly/Deut4:3), [46](https://ref.ly/Deut4:46); [34:6](https://ref.ly/Deut34:6); [Josh 13:20](https://ref.ly/Josh13:20); [22:17](https://ref.ly/Josh22:17)) were somewhere in the vicinity of Mount Nebo. • Israel’s idolatry caused the Lord’s anger to blaze against his people*;* this included a plague ([Num 25:8–9](https://ref.ly/Num25:8-Num25:9); [26:1](https://ref.ly/Num26:1); cp.[11:1](https://ref.ly/Num11:1), [10](https://ref.ly/Num11:10); [12:9](https://ref.ly/Num12:9)).

These two chapters contain information about Israel’s ritual calendar, including a list of required daily, weekly, and monthly offerings and a list of annual religious events. Thus Israel was instructed to worship God “properly and in order” ([1 Cor 14:40](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:40)). The annual cycle of sacrifices involved a tremendous investment of animals, grain, oil, and wine. Israel marked these special days by stopping their normal work, a kind of sacrifice that recognized the importance of these holy days. This annual cycle included eight different occasions for worship, all of which recalled Israel’s relationship with the Lord. Each worship event included a different combination of burnt, grain, liquid, and/or sin offerings. • For details on the grain and liquid offerings, see [Num 15:1–16](https://ref.ly/Num15:1-Num15:16). For explanations of the different types of offerings, see [Lev 1:1–7:38](https://ref.ly/Lev1:1-Lev7:38). For a description of Israel’s festivals, see [Lev 23:1–44](https://ref.ly/Lev23:1-Lev23:44).

The Day of Atonement was a solemn occasion, a day of fasting (see also [Lev 16](https://ref.ly/Lev16:1-Lev16:34); [23:26–32](https://ref.ly/Lev23:26-Lev23:32); [Rom 3:23–25](https://ref.ly/Rom3:23-Rom3:25); [Heb 9:7–12](https://ref.ly/Heb9:7-Heb9:12), [23–28](https://ref.ly/Heb9:23-Heb9:28)).

The Festival of Shelters began on the fifteenth day of the seventh month. It was an eight\-day harvest celebration ([29:12](https://ref.ly/Num29:12), [35](https://ref.ly/Num29:35); [Exod 34:22](https://ref.ly/Exod34:22)) that required an enormous number of offerings. This harvest festival was an especially joyous occasion and a time for thanksgiving (see [Neh 8:13–18](https://ref.ly/Neh8:13-Neh8:18)). The shelters also reminded the Israelites of dwelling in tents during their wilderness sojourn (see also [Lev 23:33–43](https://ref.ly/Lev23:33-Lev23:43); [1 Kgs 8:1–2](https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:1-1Kgs8:2)).

Vows included promises to give offerings, like Hannah's vow in [1 Samuel 1](https://ref.ly/1Sam1:1-1Sam1:28). It included pledges to abstain from certain things, like the Nazirite vow in [Numbers 6](https://ref.ly/Num6:1-Num6:27).

Vows were an important way to express devotion or piety, but were sometimes made in haste and were often forgotten. Voluntary pledges were commonly made on special religious occasions or in times of war. Perhaps the reference to vows and voluntary offerings ([29:39](https://ref.ly/Num29:39)) prompted the further discussion here (cp. [15:3](https://ref.ly/Num15:3); see also [6:1–21](https://ref.ly/Num6:1-Num6:21); [Lev 5:4–5](https://ref.ly/Lev5:4-Lev5:5); [27:1–34](https://ref.ly/Lev27:1-Lev27:34); [Deut 23:21–23](https://ref.ly/Deut23:21-Deut23:23)). These instructions were applied in the case of Hannah and Elkanah ([1 Sam 1:1–28](https://ref.ly/1Sam1:1-1Sam1:28)). Such practices, which included fasting, continued into the New Testament period (e.g., [Matt 6:16](https://ref.ly/Matt6:16); [15:3–9](https://ref.ly/Matt15:3-Matt15:9); [Acts 18:18](https://ref.ly/Acts18:18); [21:23](https://ref.ly/Acts21:23)). Vows of females—young and unmarried or adult and married—were subject to approval by the responsible male who would be a financial partner in the vow. Nobody, male or female, young or old, should make a vow to God and then neglect it.

A married woman also needed the approval of her husband to make vows and pledges. Her husband could nullify her religious promise, but he had to make this decision on the day he heard about it. God did not hold the married woman guilty of breaking this promise if her husband cancelled it in the proper manner (cp. [30:5](https://ref.ly/Num30:5), [8](https://ref.ly/Num30:8), [12](https://ref.ly/Num30:12)). The self\-denial mentioned in [30:13](https://ref.ly/Num30:13) probably refers to fasting. If he raised no objection, the husband’s silence implied consent. He could not delay in his objection, or he would incur the guilt of a broken vow (cp. [Lev 5:4–13](https://ref.ly/Lev5:4-Lev5:13)).

The Lord ordered Moses to lead Israel in a war of retaliation against the Midianites, who had joined the Moabites in leading the Hebrews into idolatry (ch [25](https://ref.ly/Num25:1-Num25:18)). The Midianites were a tribal people who inhabited the arid and semiarid regions south and east of Palestine and east of the Jordan River; they were counted among the “people of the east” ([Judg 6:3](https://ref.ly/Judg6:3), [33](https://ref.ly/Judg6:33); [7:12](https://ref.ly/Judg7:12)). They lived in camps or settlements and were famous for their knowledge of desert transportation (cp. [Gen 37:28](https://ref.ly/Gen37:28), [36](https://ref.ly/Gen37:36); [Isa 60:6](https://ref.ly/Isa60:6)). While they were descended from Abraham ([Gen 25:1–2](https://ref.ly/Gen25:1-Gen25:2)) and had been friendly toward Moses ([Exod 2:15–3:1](https://ref.ly/Exod2:15-Exod3:1); cp. [Num 10:29](https://ref.ly/Num10:29)), the elders of Midian had joined Balak in hiring Balaam to curse Israel ([22:4](https://ref.ly/Num22:4), [7](https://ref.ly/Num22:7)), whose presence threatened the peoples of Transjordan (the region east of the Jordan).

Phinehas son of Eleazar (the high priest) led this force of 12,000 into battle. His leadership helped to define this engagement as “holy war,” an act of revenge for the spiritual harm that Midian had inflicted on Israel (cp. [25:6–18](https://ref.ly/Num25:6-Num25:18); [31:15–16](https://ref.ly/Num31:15-Num31:16)). His zeal in this situation ([Num 25:11](https://ref.ly/Num25:11), [13](https://ref.ly/Num25:13)) was equal to what he demonstrated in the case of Zimri and Cozbi ([25:7–8](https://ref.ly/Num25:7-Num25:8)). • Many believe that holy objects of the sanctuary meant the Ark, which the Hebrews sometimes carried into battle (e.g., [10:35–36](https://ref.ly/Num10:35-Num10:36); [Josh 6:6](https://ref.ly/Josh6:6); [1 Sam 4:3–11](https://ref.ly/1Sam4:3-1Sam4:11); cp. [Num 14:44](https://ref.ly/Num14:44)). Others suggest that they were a variety of sacred vessels associated with the Tabernacle rituals ([3:31](https://ref.ly/Num3:31); [4:15](https://ref.ly/Num4:15); [18:3](https://ref.ly/Num18:3); cp.

The Israelites probably took some or all of these holy objects as symbols of God’s participation in their holy war.

[Judg 6–8](https://ref.ly/Judg6:1-Judg8:35)).

Moses and Eleazar brought this large collection to the Tabernacle as a memorial of this special event (cp. [Num 16:39–40](https://ref.ly/Num16:39-Num16:40); [Zech 6:14](https://ref.ly/Zech6:14)).

After the Israelites reached the plains of Moab opposite Jericho ([22:1](https://ref.ly/Num22:1)), they camped there for the rest of the period covered in Numbers (see [36:13](https://ref.ly/Num36:13)) and Deuteronomy ([Deut 34:8](https://ref.ly/Deut34:8)). While they were camped there, God gave Israel specific instructions for dealing with the population of Canaan. The Lord commanded his people to destroy the people groups that occupied Canaan and to obliterate all vestiges of their religious practices (cp. [Exod 23:23–33](https://ref.ly/Exod23:23-Exod23:33); [34:11–17](https://ref.ly/Exod34:11-Exod34:17); [Deut 7:1–6](https://ref.ly/Deut7:1-Deut7:6); [12:2–4](https://ref.ly/Deut12:2-Deut12:4); [Josh 23:4–8](https://ref.ly/Josh23:4-Josh23:8)). Moses’ commands included the destruction of their carved and molten images (cp.

[Chapter 34](https://ref.ly/Num34:1-Num34:29) gives the borders of the land of Canaan*,* which Israel was to settle according to the guidelines in [26:52–56](https://ref.ly/Num26:52-Num26:56). Ever since the call of Abraham ([Gen 12:1–7](https://ref.ly/Gen12:1-Gen12:7)), the Promised Land of Canaan had stood at the heart of the Old Testament story. Though an entire generation of Hebrews died in the wilderness because they refused to believe the report of the faithful spies ([Num 13](https://ref.ly/Num13:1-Num13:33)), God had reaffirmed his promise of land ([33:53](https://ref.ly/Num33:53)). Here, God reviewed the plan and identified the boundaries of the Promised Land in an idealized form (cp. [Josh 13–19](https://ref.ly/Josh13:1-Josh19:51); [Ezek 47–48](https://ref.ly/Ezek47:1-Ezek48:35)). Old Testament Israel did not possess the exact extent of the territory described here (though it came close in the days of David and Solomon; e.g., [2 Sam 24:1–9](https://ref.ly/2Sam24:1-2Sam24:9)), but these borders describe the region of Canaan as generally defined by Egyptian texts dating 1500–1200 BC (the period of the Hebrew invasion). The region actually occupied by Israel changed from time to time.

The natural eastern border of Canaan followed the Jordan River down to the Dead Sea. As part of the Great Rift Valley, the Jordan and the Dead Sea were formidable, though not impassable, barriers. This boundary excluded the lands east of the Jordan that were occupied by Reuben, Gad, and the half\-tribe of Manasseh. Those settlements were not part of Canaan per se and stood outside the Promised Land as originally defined.

The tribe of Levi received no territory, so ch [35](https://ref.ly/Num35:1-Num35:34) describes their allotment of 48 towns dispersed among the territories of Israel’s other tribes (see [Josh 21](https://ref.ly/Josh21:1-Josh21:45); see also [Lev 25:32–34](https://ref.ly/Lev25:32-Lev25:34); [1 Chr 13:2](https://ref.ly/1Chr13:2); [2 Chr 11:14](https://ref.ly/2Chr11:14)). Just as the Levites had lived in the center of the Israelite camp during the wilderness period (cp. [Num 2:17](https://ref.ly/Num2:17)), in the Promised Land they were to live among the other tribes and have a leavening influence among them (see [Deut 33:9–10](https://ref.ly/Deut33:9-Deut33:10); [2 Chr 17:7–9](https://ref.ly/2Chr17:7-2Chr17:9); [19:8–11](https://ref.ly/2Chr19:8-2Chr19:11); [35:3](https://ref.ly/2Chr35:3)). The cities and their surrounding pastureland were not a “homeland” (cp. [Num 18:23](https://ref.ly/Num18:23); [26:62](https://ref.ly/Num26:62)) but only a tiny fraction of the Canaanite territory dispersed among the other tribes.

Readers have long attempted to explain the alleged contradiction between the 1,500 feet and the 3,000 feet. If the Hebrews conceived of a town as a fixed point, then the square of territory around each town would measure 3,000 feet on each side. Another solution is to see a distinction between pastureland ([35:4](https://ref.ly/Num35:4)) and larger pastureland ([35:5](https://ref.ly/Num35:5)) around the town. On the basis of this text, some Jewish interpreters restricted the distance that one could walk on the Sabbath to 3,000 feet (2,000 cubits) from home.

Six of the Levites’ towns had a special purpose as cities of refuge*,* places where a person who has accidentally killed someone can flee for safety. This unusual institution illustrates the humanitarian aspect of Hebrew law (see also [Deut 4:41–43](https://ref.ly/Deut4:41-Deut4:43); [19:1–13](https://ref.ly/Deut19:1-Deut19:13); [Josh 20](https://ref.ly/Josh20:1-Josh20:9)). These six Levitical towns provided a safe haven in cases of accidental or involuntary manslaughter (cp. [Exod 21:12–14](https://ref.ly/Exod21:12-Exod21:14)). Just as the forty\-eight Levite towns were widely distributed across Israel’s territories, the six cities of refuge were dispersed so they would be widely accessible (see [Josh 20:7–8](https://ref.ly/Josh20:7-Josh20:8)). These designated settlements supplemented the role of the altar as a temporary place of asylum (e.g., [1 Kgs 1:50–53](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:50-1Kgs1:53); [2:28–34](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:28-1Kgs2:34); cp. [Exod 21:14](https://ref.ly/Exod21:14)). Other ancient peoples provided special places of asylum or refuge, often at the altar (see [Exod 21:12–14](https://ref.ly/Exod21:12-Exod21:14); [1 Kgs 2:28–34](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:28-1Kgs2:34)), but only ancient Israel established whole settlements as places of sanctuary, reflecting a special interest in social justice.

[Num 15:22–31](https://ref.ly/Num15:22-Num15:31)). Murder required a penalty of execution, but an accidental death did not. The cities of refuge provided protection only for those who killed another person by accident. • The use of a weapon was proof of malicious intent.
