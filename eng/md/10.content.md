## 2 Samuel 1:1 (id: 14831)

David returned from his victory: Just prior to this encounter, David and his men had killed many Amalekites because of what they had done to David’s city and family (see [1 Sam 30](https://ref.ly/1Sam30:1-1Sam30:31)).

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 1:1

## 2 Samuel 1:1–16 (id: 14824)

An unnamed Amalekite sought out David, claiming to have killed Saul. This was a lie, as Saul had committed suicide ([1 Sam 31:4–6](https://ref.ly/1Sam31:4-1Sam31:6)). The Amalekite might have hoped that David would reward him for making it possible for David to assume the throne. Instead, David ordered him killed for harming the Lord’s anointed.

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 1:1–2SA 1:16

## 2 Samuel 1:1–27 (id: 14825)

The forty years of Saul’s reign came to a painful end. The Philistines inflicted a crushing blow on Saul’s people, killing his sons and dismembering Saul’s body after his suicide ([1 Sam 31](https://ref.ly/1Sam31:1-1Sam31:13)). On the heels of these tragedies, David’s career as leader came into focus.

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 1:1–2SA 1:27

## 2 Samuel 1:4 (id: 14837)

What happened? David was not aware of what had happened to Saul—he had no part in Saul’s death. • Saul and . . . Jonathan are also dead: Two other sons of Saul, Abinadab and Malkishua, were killed as well ([1 Sam 31:2](https://ref.ly/1Sam31:2)). The Amalekite was either unaware of their deaths or he mentioned only the son who would stand in the way of David’s uncontested path to Israel’s throne.

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 1:4

## 2 Samuel 1:6 (id: 14838)

The Amalekite man’s second lie is, I happened to be on Mount Gilboa. Instead, he had probably scoured the area after the battle, looking for victims whose valuables he could take.

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 1:6

## 2 Samuel 1:9 (id: 14839)

Then he begged me: This is the Amalekite’s third lie; instead, Saul was probably already dead (cp. [1 Sam 31:4–6](https://ref.ly/1Sam31:4-1Sam31:6)).

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 1:9

## 2 Samuel 1:10 (id: 14826)

The Amalekite apparently got to Saul’s corpse before the Philistines did, for they would not have left royal items such as his crown and his armband on his body. • Israel’s king wore a crown (Hebrew nezer, “consecration”) as a sign of his consecration to God and status as the Lord’s anointed ([1:14](https://ref.ly/2Sam1:14)).

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 1:10

## 2 Samuel 1:13 (id: 14827)

Where are you from? David’s asking again ([1:8](https://ref.ly/2Sam1:8)) likely reflects the depth of his grief.

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 1:13

## 2 Samuel 1:15–16 (id: 14828)

The Amalekite expected a reward for killing David’s rival but was instead condemned for killing the Lord’s anointed. David himself had twice refused the opportunity to kill Saul (see [1 Sam 24:5–7](https://ref.ly/1Sam24:5-1Sam24:7); [26:9–11](https://ref.ly/1Sam26:9-1Sam26:11)).

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 1:15–2SA 1:16

## 2 Samuel 1:18 (id: 14829)

The extrabiblical Book of Jashar is no longer available. It was probably an Israelite epic poem or an anthology of poetry that covered, at minimum, Joshua’s conquest of Canaan (see [Josh 10:13](https://ref.ly/Josh10:13)) and the ascension of David.

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 1:18

## 2 Samuel 1:19 (id: 14830)

Your pride and joy: David’s description focused more on Saul’s royal position than on his personal characteristics.

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 1:19

## 2 Samuel 1:20 (id: 14832)

Gath and Ashkelon were major Philistine cities. Announcing the news of Saul’s death to the Philistines would give this hated foe the opportunity to gloat and glorify their false god, Dagon, while mocking Israel’s God, Yahweh. • daughters of the Philistines: In ancient war culture, young women sometimes celebrated victories in song (cp. [Exod 15:20–21](https://ref.ly/Exod15:20-Exod15:21); [1 Sam 18:7](https://ref.ly/1Sam18:7)).

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 1:20

## 2 Samuel 1:21 (id: 14833)

Saul and Jonathan died in the mountains of Gilboa ([1 Sam 31:1](https://ref.ly/1Sam31:1)). • let there be no dew or rain: David was invoking a curse on the place of their death. In a Canaanite text from the 1300s BC, a father invokes a very similar curse on the place of his son’s death. • The shield of Saul symbolizes his military exploits as king. It would no longer be anointed with oil for the same reason that Saul was no longer the anointed king, because of his death.

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 1:21

## 2 Samuel 1:22 (id: 14834)

the blood of their enemies: Saul and Jonathan were known as military heroes (see [1 Sam 11:1–11](https://ref.ly/1Sam11:1-1Sam11:11); [14:1–23](https://ref.ly/1Sam14:1-1Sam14:23), [47–48](https://ref.ly/1Sam14:47-1Sam14:48)), though neither to the degree that David was ([1 Sam 18:7](https://ref.ly/1Sam18:7); [21:11](https://ref.ly/1Sam21:11)).

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 1:22

## 2 Samuel 1:23 (id: 14835)

beloved and gracious . . . together in life and in death: Although the relationship between Saul and Jonathan was strained, especially due to Saul’s treatment of David (see [1 Sam 20:30–33](https://ref.ly/1Sam20:30-1Sam20:33)), Jonathan nevertheless fought and died alongside his father while defending Israel against the Philistine menace.

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 1:23

## 2 Samuel 1:26 (id: 14836)

deeper than the love of women: Jonathan’s loyalty and friendship to David involved personal risk and sacrifice. This commitment was unmatched in David’s experience, including the love of his wives. The phrase in no way implies a homosexual relationship. Jonathan’s love for David is highlighted three times in 1 Samuel ([1 Sam 18:1](https://ref.ly/1Sam18:1), [3](https://ref.ly/1Sam18:3); [20:17](https://ref.ly/1Sam20:17)).

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 1:26

## 2 Samuel 2:1 (id: 14992)

David asked the Lord (cp. [5:23–24](https://ref.ly/2Sam5:23-2Sam5:24); [Judg 1:1–2](https://ref.ly/Judg1:1-Judg1:2); [20:18](https://ref.ly/Judg20:18); [1 Sam 10:22](https://ref.ly/1Sam10:22)) by consulting the Urim and Thummim (see [Exod 28:30](https://ref.ly/Exod28:30); [Lev 8:8](https://ref.ly/Lev8:8); [Deut 33:8](https://ref.ly/Deut33:8); [1 Sam 14:41](https://ref.ly/1Sam14:41)) administered by Abiathar, David’s priest ([1 Sam 23:1–12](https://ref.ly/1Sam23:1-1Sam23:12); [30:7–8](https://ref.ly/1Sam30:7-1Sam30:8)). David acted when God directed, not before. • Hebron was nineteen miles southwest of Jerusalem. Abraham had lived in this area for a time and eventually purchased a nearby cave for a family burial plot ([Gen 23](https://ref.ly/Gen23:1-Gen23:20)). The people of the area were sympathetic toward David (see [1 Sam 30:26–31](https://ref.ly/1Sam30:26-1Sam30:31)).

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 2:1

## 2 Samuel 2:1–32 (id: 14984)

After Saul died, those loyal to David (the tribe of Judah) clashed with those loyal to Saul’s son Ishbosheth (the remaining tribes of Israel). The Philistines, who at this time were essentially overlords of all Palestine west of the Jordan River, likely favored and encouraged this division because it made it easier for them to divide and conquer.

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 2:1–2SA 2:32

## 2 Samuel 2:2 (id: 14998)

Ahinoam: See study note on 1 Sam 25:43. David’s other wife, Saul’s daughter Michal, had been given to another man after David fled from Saul ([1 Sam 25:44](https://ref.ly/1Sam25:44)). • Abigail: See [1 Sam 25](https://ref.ly/1Sam25:1-1Sam25:44).

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 2:2
* **Associated Articles:** 1 Samuel 25:43 (ID: `17047@TyndaleStudyNotes`)

## 2 Samuel 2:4–7 (id: 15000)

Once established in Hebron, David made good faith gestures to those still loyal to Saul, such as the men of Jabesh\-gilead. However, because they were loyal to . . . Saul and his dynasty, they rejected David as king ([2:8–11](https://ref.ly/2Sam2:8-2Sam2:11)). David was also in league with Nahash, king of the Ammonites (see [10:2](https://ref.ly/2Sam10:2); [17:27–29](https://ref.ly/2Sam17:27-2Sam17:29)), who had caused havoc in Jabesh\-gilead ([1 Sam 11:1–15](https://ref.ly/1Sam11:1-1Sam11:15)).

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 2:4–2SA 2:7

## 2 Samuel 2:7 (id: 15001)

David’s anointing by the people of Judah provided the legal basis of his kingship, just as it had for Saul ([1 Sam 11:15](https://ref.ly/1Sam11:15)). He had been anointed by the prophet Samuel years earlier ([1 Sam 16:13](https://ref.ly/1Sam16:13)).

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 2:7

## 2 Samuel 2:8 (id: 15002)

Abner: See study note on 1 Sam 20:25. • Mahanaim was located east of the Jordan River, deep in the highlands of Gilead near a plentiful source of fresh water. Saul and his family had close ties to Gilead ([1 Sam 11:1–11](https://ref.ly/1Sam11:1-1Sam11:11); [31:11–13](https://ref.ly/1Sam31:11-1Sam31:13)). Locating east of the Jordan made Ishbosheth’s regime less susceptible to attack by David’s forces. This same area was later King David’s temporary refuge after Absalom’s coup ([2 Sam 17:24](https://ref.ly/2Sam17:24), [27](https://ref.ly/2Sam17:27)). •*Ishbosheth* means “man of shame.” His original name, *Esh\-baal*, means “man of Baal.” The name *Baal* (“lord, master, possessor”) was associated with a pagan Canaanite deity (e.g., see [Num 25:3](https://ref.ly/Num25:3)), so it is likely that Ishbosheth’s name was later changed because of that association.

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 2:8
* **Associated Articles:** 1 Samuel 20:25 (ID: `16982@TyndaleStudyNotes`)

## 2 Samuel 2:9 (id: 15003)

Gilead was the easternmost district of the northern kingdom, Jezreel the northernmost, and Benjamin the southernmost, with Ephraim in the middle. It is unclear which area was the land of the Ashurites. All the rest of Israel refers to the tribes that Ishbosheth ruled over rather than to the geographical area of his kingdom.

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 2:9

## 2 Samuel 2:10–11 (id: 14985)

Ishbosheth . . . ruled from Mahanaim for two years at some point during David’s 7½\-year reign from Hebron. Apparently a gap of five years occurred in which the northern tribes were without a king.

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 2:10–2SA 2:11

## 2 Samuel 2:12 (id: 14987)

Gibeon, about five miles northwest of Jerusalem, was a key city in Benjamin.

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 2:12

## 2 Samuel 2:12–32 (id: 14986)

A protracted civil war ensued between Judah (led by David) and the northern tribes (led by Saul’s dynasty). These events set the stage for Abner’s murder ([3:22–39](https://ref.ly/2Sam3:22-2Sam3:39)).

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 2:12–2SA 2:32

## 2 Samuel 2:13 (id: 14988)

The pool of Gibeon extends down some 80 feet to the water table. Archaeologists estimate that the original diggers had to remove about 3,000 tons of limestone to create it.

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 2:13

## 2 Samuel 2:14 (id: 14989)

a few of our warriors: In the ancient world, enemy armies would sometimes choose individuals or small groups to fight each other as representative gladiators—a custom often referred to as champion warfare (see also [1 Sam 17](https://ref.ly/1Sam17:1-1Sam17:58)). • fight hand to hand: The Hebrew term usually includes a component of play. A contest of champions might have been seen as a type of high\-stakes game. In this instance, it settled nothing; the fighting expanded into a much wider confrontation with heavier casualties ([2 Sam 2:17–32](https://ref.ly/2Sam2:17-2Sam2:32)).

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 2:14

## 2 Samuel 2:17 (id: 14990)

The casualty count of this fierce battle is noted in [2:30–31](https://ref.ly/2Sam2:30-2Sam2:31).

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 2:17

## 2 Samuel 2:18 (id: 14991)

Zeruiah was David’s sister ([1 Chr 2:15–16](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:15-1Chr2:16)), so Joab, Abishai, and Asahel were his nephews.

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 2:18

## 2 Samuel 2:20–22 (id: 14993)

Go fight someone else! . . . Get away from here! Abner’s words reflect respect between peers trained for the same career, as well as a sense of fair play. The youthful Asahel would have been no match for the more experienced Abner. Abner also knew that if he killed Asahel, the conflict with David would escalate and David’s forces would seek revenge (see [3:22–39](https://ref.ly/2Sam3:22-2Sam3:39)).

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 2:20–2SA 2:22

## 2 Samuel 2:24 (id: 14994)

they set out after Abner: See [3:27](https://ref.ly/2Sam3:27). • Ammah (“conduit”) and Giah (“gushing”) suggest that there was an aqueduct system connected to the pool at Gibeon ([2:12–13](https://ref.ly/2Sam2:12-2Sam2:13)).

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 2:24

## 2 Samuel 2:26 (id: 14995)

bitterness is the only result: Realizing that such wars go on generation after generation, Abner wisely negotiated a truce.

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 2:26

## 2 Samuel 2:28 (id: 14996)

The ram’s horn signaled the beginning and end of combat (see also [18:16](https://ref.ly/2Sam18:16); [Josh 6:15–16](https://ref.ly/Josh6:15-Josh6:16)). For other uses of the ram’s horn, see study note on 2 Sam 6:15.

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 2:28
* **Associated Articles:** 2 Samuel 6:15 (ID: `15136@TyndaleStudyNotes`)

## 2 Samuel 2:29 (id: 14997)

Abner was wise to put as much distance as possible between his troops and Joab’s forces, recognizing that their desire for blood vengeance could overpower the truce.

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 2:29

## 2 Samuel 2:31 (id: 14999)

The 360 who died were all from the tribe of Benjamin, Saul’s tribe, under the leadership of one of Saul’s relatives. This defeat was a direct blow to Saul’s dynasty (cp. [3:1](https://ref.ly/2Sam3:1)).

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 2:31

## 2 Samuel 3:1 (id: 15084)

a long war: This civil war likely continued for most of the seven\-plus years that David ruled from Hebron. The truce called by Joab and Abner ([2:26–28](https://ref.ly/2Sam2:26-2Sam2:28)) was short\-lived.

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 3:1

## 2 Samuel 3:1–39 (id: 15073)

The house of David increased, while Saul’s house dwindled. The crucial occasion came when Abner, the real political power in Saul’s camp, switched allegiance to David, taking a considerable number of his northern kinsmen with him.

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 3:1–2SA 3:39

## 2 Samuel 3:2–5 (id: 15085)

One way David “became stronger and stronger” ([3:1](https://ref.ly/2Sam3:1)) was by taking more wives and having a son through each. Three of David’s Hebron\-born sons died violent deaths, two during David’s reign (Amnon, Absalom), and one shortly after his death (Adonijah).

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 3:2–2SA 3:5

## 2 Samuel 3:3 (id: 15099)

Geshur was a small Canaanite kingdom in upper Transjordan (the area east of the Jordan) near the Sea of Galilee. Marrying into neighboring royal families created political alliances and secured David’s position against the northern tribes. Solomon also followed this practice ([1 Kgs 3:1](https://ref.ly/1Kgs3:1); [11:1](https://ref.ly/1Kgs11:1)).

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 3:3

## 2 Samuel 3:7 (id: 15100)

accused Abner of sleeping with one of \[Saul’s] concubines: It is unclear whether Abner actually did so. Taking a king’s wife or concubine was often part of a usurper’s attempt to replace the king (see [12:8](https://ref.ly/2Sam12:8); [16:21](https://ref.ly/2Sam16:21); [1 Kgs 2:17–25](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:17-1Kgs2:25)). • Rizpah: See also [2 Sam 21:8–14](https://ref.ly/2Sam21:8-2Sam21:14).

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 3:7

## 2 Samuel 3:8 (id: 15101)

some Judean dog: Cp. [1 Sam 17:43](https://ref.ly/1Sam17:43). • by not handing you over to David: Abner had control over the life and death of Saul’s son.

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 3:8

## 2 Samuel 3:9 (id: 15102)

help David get what the Lord has promised him! Abner was aware that God had chosen David to be king over all Israel (see also [3:18](https://ref.ly/2Sam3:18)).

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 3:9

## 2 Samuel 3:10 (id: 15074)

and give it to David: Cp. [1 Sam 28:17](https://ref.ly/1Sam28:17). • I will establish the throne of David: Whether an ally or enemy, Abner was a powerful man. Here he speaks like God (see [2 Sam 7:13](https://ref.ly/2Sam7:13)).

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 3:10

## 2 Samuel 3:11 (id: 15075)

didn’t dare say another word: Ishbosheth’s silence speaks loudly of his weakness as a ruler. Abner, who had installed him as king ([2:8–9](https://ref.ly/2Sam2:8-2Sam2:9)), was the real power behind Ishbosheth’s reign.

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 3:11

## 2 Samuel 3:12 (id: 15076)

In the proposed solemn pact (or *covenant*), Abner recognized that David would be king, while perhaps he hoped to be second\-in\-command.

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 3:12

## 2 Samuel 3:13 (id: 15077)

Saul had given his daughter Michal to David as his wife ([1 Sam 18:20–27](https://ref.ly/1Sam18:20-1Sam18:27)). However, when Michal saved David’s life from her father ([1 Sam 19:11–17](https://ref.ly/1Sam19:11-1Sam19:17)), Saul terminated the marriage and gave Michal to another man, Palti ([1 Sam 25:44](https://ref.ly/1Sam25:44)). For David to get her back now would further cement his claim to Saul’s kingdom (cp. [1 Kgs 2:13–25](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:13-1Kgs2:25)).

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 3:13

## 2 Samuel 3:14 (id: 15078)

the lives of 100 Philistines: Saul had hoped that David would be killed in his attempt to secure the bride\-price (see [1 Sam 18:17–27](https://ref.ly/1Sam18:17-1Sam18:27)).

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 3:14

## 2 Samuel 3:15 (id: 15079)

Ishbosheth took: Although Abner made the deal with David ([3:12–13](https://ref.ly/2Sam3:12-2Sam3:13)), it was Ishbosheth who gave Michal to David. This transaction illustrates Ishbosheth’s weakness as a king and his fear of Abner ([3:11](https://ref.ly/2Sam3:11)).

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 3:15

## 2 Samuel 3:16 (id: 15080)

In spite of Palti’s anguished weeping*,* he was powerless to stop what was happening (cp. [Judg 18:1–26](https://ref.ly/Judg18:1-Judg18:26)). • Bahurim was probably a center of support for Saul’s clan just east of Jerusalem (cp. [2 Sam 16:5](https://ref.ly/2Sam16:5)).

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 3:16

## 2 Samuel 3:17 (id: 15081)

Apparently, there had been growing momentum among the elders of Israel in the north to accept David as king, though the text has made no mention of it to this point.

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 3:17

## 2 Samuel 3:18 (id: 15082)

See also [3:9](https://ref.ly/2Sam3:9). By bringing relief from the Philistines*,* David would accomplish what Saul had failed to do ([1 Sam 9:16](https://ref.ly/1Sam9:16)).

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 3:18

## 2 Samuel 3:19 (id: 15083)

Because Saul was from their tribe, the men of Benjamin no doubt viewed David, from Judah, as a usurper of Saul’s throne. However, Abner was well\-respected in Saul’s regime and so was able to elicit support for David even among Saul’s own tribe.

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 3:19

## 2 Samuel 3:21 (id: 15086)

The narrator emphasized that David sent Abner safely on his way as a friend and an ally (restated in [3:22–23](https://ref.ly/2Sam3:22-2Sam3:23)). David was at peace with Abner and was not involved in the renowned military leader’s murder (cp. [3:28–29](https://ref.ly/2Sam3:28-2Sam3:29)). • Despite the murder of Abner ([3:27](https://ref.ly/2Sam3:27)), the northern tribes eventually did make a covenant with David to make him their king, just as Abner had promised ([5:1–3](https://ref.ly/2Sam5:1-2Sam5:3)).

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 3:21

## 2 Samuel 3:26 (id: 15087)

The precise location of the well of Sirah is unknown; presumably it was not far from Hebron. • David knew nothing about it: See study note on 3:21.

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 3:26
* **Associated Articles:** 2 Samuel 3:21 (ID: `15086@TyndaleStudyNotes`)

## 2 Samuel 3:27 (id: 15088)

as if to speak with him privately: Joab accused Abner of deception ([3:25](https://ref.ly/2Sam3:25)), but he used deception himself to lure Abner to his death. • in revenge: Joab was motivated by the practice of blood vengeance, avenging the death of a kinsman by killing the killer.

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 3:27

## 2 Samuel 3:28 (id: 15089)

David made it clear that he had nothing to do with Abner’s death, labeling it as a crime. David knew that because his second\-in\-command had killed Abner, rumors would circulate among those loyal to Saul’s dynasty that David had ordered the killing. • I vow by the Lord: David called on the Lord to hold him accountable if he were lying.

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 3:28

## 2 Samuel 3:29 (id: 15090)

leprosy: While *leprosy* is a possible translation, the Hebrew here probably refers to a broader range of skin inflammations, not only Hansen’s disease. • who walks on crutches: This curse effectively alienated Joab from David, and from this point on they had only a professional relationship. David’s deathbed order to Solomon to get rid of Joab ([1 Kgs 2:5–6](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:5-1Kgs2:6)) and Solomon’s exoneration of David in Abner’s death ([1 Kgs 2:31–33](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:31-1Kgs2:33)) indicate that David’s mourning over Abner was genuine.

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 3:29

## 2 Samuel 3:30 (id: 15091)

See [2 Samuel 2:18–28](https://ref.ly/2Sam2:18-2Sam2:28).

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 3:30

## 2 Samuel 3:31 (id: 15092)

David himself walked: David’s public presence in the mourning procession, his open weeping at the gravesite ([3:32](https://ref.ly/2Sam3:32)), and his dramatic fast ([3:35](https://ref.ly/2Sam3:35)) made evident to the public that he had not ordered Abner’s killing ([3:37](https://ref.ly/2Sam3:37)).

## 2 Samuel 4:1 (id: 15104)

all Israel became paralyzed with fear: Abner’s true power was evident in Ishbosheth’s reaction to his death (cp. [Josh 2:9–11](https://ref.ly/Josh2:9-Josh2:11); [5:1](https://ref.ly/Josh5:1)). Ishbosheth’s timidity bred the same among his followers.

## 2 Samuel 4:2–3 (id: 15105)

Beeroth was located in Benjamin near Gibeon. Probably because of Saul’s persecution of the non\-Israelite residents in that region (see [21:1–9](https://ref.ly/2Sam21:1-2Sam21:9)), the citizens of *Beeroth* had fled to Gittaim*,* the location of which is unknown.

## 2 Samuel 4:4 (id: 15106)

This parenthetical statement shows that, with the death of Ishbosheth ([4:5–7](https://ref.ly/2Sam4:5-2Sam4:7)), Saul’s dynasty was unable to continue—the only other heir was a young child who was crippled (see also [9:1–13](https://ref.ly/2Sam9:1-2Sam9:13)). • Mephibosheth is a nickname meaning “from the mouth of shame,” possibly referring to his physical condition. No crippled animal could ever be offered to God, and no disabled priest was allowed to stand before God with the people’s offerings ([Lev 21:19](https://ref.ly/Lev21:19)). Likewise, Mephibosheth’s condition probably disqualified him from the crown. His name change from Merib\-baal (see [1 Chr 9:40](https://ref.ly/1Chr9:40)) also removed association with Baal (see study note on 2 Sam 2:8).

After the murder of Abner and Ishbosheth, the elders of the northern tribes accepted David as their king.

## 2 Samuel 5:2 (id: 15122)

you were the one: In the ancient world, a covenant relationship (a suzerain\-vassal treaty) was sometimes formed between subjects (the vassals) and a ruler (the suzerain) because of past aid, often rescue from enemies (see [Judg 8:22](https://ref.ly/Judg8:22), Gideon; [Judg 11:8–11](https://ref.ly/Judg11:8-Judg11:11), Jephthah; [1 Sam 11:1–15](https://ref.ly/1Sam11:1-1Sam11:15), Saul). This type of relationship is the background for the covenant concept in Scripture: God was Israel’s covenant Lord because he had freed them from Egypt (cp. [Exod 19:4](https://ref.ly/Exod19:4); [20:1–2](https://ref.ly/Exod20:1-Exod20:2)). • the Lord told you: Israel was already aware of God’s selection of David (cp.

## 2 Samuel 5:6 (id: 15126)

The Jebusites resided in Jerusalem prior to its conquest by David (see [Exod 34:11](https://ref.ly/Exod34:11); [Deut 7:1–6](https://ref.ly/Deut7:1-Deut7:6); [20:17](https://ref.ly/Deut20:17); [Josh 15:63](https://ref.ly/Josh15:63); [Judg 1:21](https://ref.ly/Judg1:21)). Nothing is known of them outside the Bible. In archaeological discoveries from Mari in Syria, a similar name (*Yabasi*) appears as both a clan name and a geographic location. • Even the blind and lame: The Jebusites had a false notion of invincibility. Another possible translation is *you won’t enter here unless you can get rid of the blind and lame,* implying that David’s capture of Jerusalem was as likely as achieving a miraculous cure for blindness and lameness.

the fortress of Zion: At this time Jerusalem was probably a small site of nine to twelve square acres. The Jebusites’ arrogance, and the fact that the city had not been conquered previously, suggests that it was well fortified.

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 5:7

## 2 Samuel 5:8 (id: 15128)

How David conquered Jerusalem is debated. Possibly he used a water tunnel as a conduit for his troops to enter the city, but not all interpreters agree. Another possibility is that David and his men conquered Jerusalem with the more traditional siege works and by scaling the walls. The term translated *water tunnel* occurs only here and in [Ps 42:7](https://ref.ly/Ps42:7) (“raging seas”); the statement might be metaphorical, referring to the ferocity of the attack. • The blind and the lame may not enter the house: *House* could refer either to the Temple, which had not yet been built, or to David’s palace. The proverb may explain why Mephibosheth, Saul’s descendant, was barred from the throne (see study note on 2 Sam 4:4). • David also promised that those who undertook the siege of Jerusalem would become the commanders of his army (see [1 Chr 11:6](https://ref.ly/1Chr11:6)).

## 2 Samuel 5:11 (id: 15112)

Hiram of Tyre: Although the meeting of these two neighboring kings is reported just after Jerusalem’s conquest, it probably happened much later. Hiram remained on the throne in Tyre at least until Solomon’s twenty\-fourth year, and one ancient source notes that he had a reign of thirty\-four years. Another tradition implies that Hiram became king of Tyre just eight years before Solomon became king of Israel. The same king performed a similar act for Solomon ([1 Kgs 5:1–18](https://ref.ly/1Kgs5:1-1Kgs5:18)). The report of Hiram’s support is perhaps given here because it ties in with the theme of David’s confirmation and establishment as Israel’s king ([2 Sam 5:12](https://ref.ly/2Sam5:12)).

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 5:11

## 2 Samuel 5:12 (id: 15113)

The expansion of David’s family reflected his growing success and power as Israel’s king. Solomon was David’s most important Jerusalem\-born son (see [12:24–25](https://ref.ly/2Sam12:24-2Sam12:25)).

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 5:13–2SA 5:16

## 2 Samuel 5:17–25 (id: 15115)

For the first time as king, David engaged the Philistines in battle. • David’s life has been portrayed thus far in 2 Samuel with a repeated pattern: He was crowned king in Hebron ([2:4](https://ref.ly/2Sam2:4)), won a battle ([2:12–17](https://ref.ly/2Sam2:12-2Sam2:17)), became stronger ([3:1](https://ref.ly/2Sam3:1)), and started a large family ([3:2–5](https://ref.ly/2Sam3:2-2Sam3:5)). Now he was crowned in Jerusalem ([5:3](https://ref.ly/2Sam5:3)), became stronger ([5:10](https://ref.ly/2Sam5:10)), expanded his family ([5:13–14](https://ref.ly/2Sam5:13-2Sam5:14)), and won a battle ([5:17–25](https://ref.ly/2Sam5:17-2Sam5:25)).

## 2 Samuel 5:20 (id: 15118)

Baal\-perazim: David used the term *Baal* to honor the Lord for the victory he gave Israel. The title means “the lord of earthquakes/openings,” and was evidently an acceptable title for Yahweh until the Canaanite worship of Baal became an overwhelming problem in Israel. Every time David engaged in combat with the Philistines in 2 Samuel ([5:17–25](https://ref.ly/2Sam5:17-2Sam5:25); [8:1](https://ref.ly/2Sam8:1); [21:15–22](https://ref.ly/2Sam21:15-2Sam21:22); [23:13–17](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:13-2Sam23:17)), he won without losing a single soldier. How different from Saul, for whom victory over the Philistines was impossible!

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 5:20

## 2 Samuel 5:21 (id: 15119)

David . . . confiscated them: David’s confiscation of the Philistines’ idols was payback for their capture of the Ark during Eli’s time ([1 Sam 4:1b\-11](https://ref.ly/1Sam4:1-1Sam4:11)). David burned the idols rather than carrying them off as trophies ([1 Chr 14:12](https://ref.ly/1Chr14:12)).

## 2 Samuel 6:1–23 (id: 15130)

Except for the brief reference in [1 Sam 14:18](https://ref.ly/1Sam14:18) (see note), the Ark of the Covenant has not been mentioned since [1 Sam 7:1–2](https://ref.ly/1Sam7:1-1Sam7:2), when the Philistines returned the captured Ark to Beth\-shemesh and then to Kiriath\-jearim, where it was placed in Abinadab’s home. The Ark’s virtual absence during Saul’s forty\-year reign highlights that Saul, in his spiritual insensitivity, did not seek the Lord (see [1 Chr 10:13–14](https://ref.ly/1Chr10:13-1Chr10:14); [13:3](https://ref.ly/1Chr13:3)). David brought the Ark into Jerusalem, effectively acknowledging and enthroning (see [2 Sam 6:2](https://ref.ly/2Sam6:2)) Yahweh as the true king over Israel in the new capital.

God’s instructions were ignored in this instance. • Uzzah and Ahio: In [1 Sam 7:1](https://ref.ly/1Sam7:1), Eleazar, another son of Abinadab, was put in charge of the Ark.

He suffered the same penalty as the people from Beth\-shemesh ([1 Sam 6:19](https://ref.ly/1Sam6:19)). David later had the Levites carry the Ark into Jerusalem in accordance with God’s will (see [1 Chr 15:2](https://ref.ly/1Chr15:2), [13–15](https://ref.ly/1Chr15:13-1Chr15:15)).

Michal is identified as the daughter of Saul three times ([6:16](https://ref.ly/2Sam6:16), [20](https://ref.ly/2Sam6:20), [23](https://ref.ly/2Sam6:23)). The use of her father’s name underscores the ambiguity of David’s relationship to her. Was she more David’s wife or Saul’s daughter? Had David reunited with her ([3:13](https://ref.ly/2Sam3:13)) because he loved her or because she was politically useful to him? • Michal might have been filled with contempt for any of the following reasons: (1\) She thought David’s behavior was too sexually suggestive in front of a young female audience; (2\) she was jealous over the glory David was receiving while she sat at home, a neglected wife; (3\) she resented David’s indifference to her for many years, his taking of other wives, and her being torn away from her second husband Palti ([3:16–17](https://ref.ly/2Sam3:16-2Sam3:17)); or (4\) she felt sorrow for her late father and David’s success at the expense of Saul’s dynasty (see study note on 6:21).

David’s special tent was the very last Tabernacle; Solomon, David’s successor, built a permanent Temple for the Lord.

Nathan is recorded in David’s life on three occasions: (1\) here with a promise for David; (2\) in [12:1–15](https://ref.ly/2Sam12:1-2Sam12:15) with a parable of judgment against David; (3\) in [1 Kgs 1:11–27](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:11-1Kgs1:27) with a plan for installing Solomon as David’s successor. • A cedar palace would have been made of stone with cedar paneling inside.

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 7:2

## 2 Samuel 7:3 (id: 15169)

Go ahead and do whatever you have in mind: Nathan’s counsel to David was Nathan’s own idea. As it turned out, God disqualified David from building the Temple (see [1 Chr 22:8](https://ref.ly/1Chr22:8)). Even true prophets are fallible when speaking on their own initiative rather than from God’s revelation.

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 7:3

## 2 Samuel 7:5 (id: 15170)

Are you the one? God wanted someone to build him a house, but David wasn’t the right person.

## 2 Samuel 7:6 (id: 15171)

never lived in a house: Prior to the building of the Temple in one fixed location, God’s dwelling was the Tabernacle, a mobile, tentlike structure. The text here uses language of human experience to describe a truth about God (see study notes on Exod 29:18; Deut 8:2). Although God is omnipresent, he chose the Tabernacle and Temple as his “dwelling place” in ancient Israel (see study note on 2 Chr 2:5–6; cp. [Acts 17:24](https://ref.ly/Acts17:24)).

## 2 Samuel 7:7 (id: 15172)

I have never once complained . . . never asked: While it was a less impressive structure than the Temple, the Tabernacle honored God because he had ordained its use for that period of Israel’s history.

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 7:7

## 2 Samuel 7:8 (id: 15174)

tending sheep: Kings in the ancient Near East were often called shepherds (see [1 Kgs 22:17](https://ref.ly/1Kgs22:17); [Isa 44:28](https://ref.ly/Isa44:28); [Ezek 34:2](https://ref.ly/Ezek34:2); [37:24](https://ref.ly/Ezek37:24); [Nah 3:18](https://ref.ly/Nah3:18); [Zech 10:3](https://ref.ly/Zech10:3)).

## 2 Samuel 7:8–17 (id: 15173)

Instead of David’s building God a house, God promised to build David a house, a permanent dynasty of kings from David’s descendants.

## 2 Samuel 7:9 (id: 15175)

I have been with you: Through his guidance and protection, God was actively involved in shaping David’s entire life. • I will make your name . . . famous: God made this promise only to Abraham and David. (see [Gen 12:2](https://ref.ly/Gen12:2)).

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 7:9

## 2 Samuel 7:10–11 (id: 15152)

never be disturbed: Through David and his heirs, a lasting peace would engulf the land, in contrast with the intermittent and temporary periods of peace during the days of the judges, when one predatory nation after another shattered Israel’s well\-being. God’s promise of rest from all your enemies was first mentioned by Joshua ([Josh 1:13](https://ref.ly/Josh1:13), [15](https://ref.ly/Josh1:15); [22:4](https://ref.ly/Josh22:4)), and later realized in the ministry of some of the judges ([Judg 3:11](https://ref.ly/Judg3:11), [30](https://ref.ly/Judg3:30); [5:31](https://ref.ly/Judg5:31); [8:28](https://ref.ly/Judg8:28)).

## 2 Samuel 7:11 (id: 15153)

he will make a house for you: God wanted to do infinitely more for David than David could conceive of doing for God. While David was primarily interested in projects such as building a temple, God was interested in bringing blessing to his people through one righteous dynasty of kings.

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 7:11

## 2 Samuel 7:12–13 (id: 15154)

one of your descendants . . . will build a house . . . for my name: David’s son Solomon would build the Temple; David’s personal involvement in military conflict and bloodshed disqualified him from building God’s Temple ([1 Chr 22:8–9](https://ref.ly/1Chr22:8-1Chr22:9)).

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 7:12–2SA 7:13

## 2 Samuel 7:14 (id: 15155)

I will be his father, and he will be my son: Kings in David’s line would enjoy a special covenant relationship with God, as the whole nation of Israel did (cp. [Exod 6:7](https://ref.ly/Exod6:7); [Lev 26:12](https://ref.ly/Lev26:12)). Jesus later became the ultimate fulfillment of this prophecy (see [Heb 1:5](https://ref.ly/Heb1:5)). Paul quotes this phrase in [2 Cor 6:18](https://ref.ly/2Cor6:18) and applies it to all believers. • If he sins, I will correct and discipline him: God would steer David’s offspring, the future kings of Israel, back onto the right track whenever they sinned. Cp. the experience of Jesus, who never sinned, yet endured God’s discipline (see [Heb 4:15](https://ref.ly/Heb4:15); [5:8](https://ref.ly/Heb5:8); [12:1–11](https://ref.ly/Heb12:1-Heb12:11)).

## 2 Samuel 7:16 (id: 15156)

for all time . . . forever: God’s promises do not negate human responsibility and accountability ([7:14](https://ref.ly/2Sam7:14)). Wrongdoing requires a just response from God. However, no wayward son of David could move God to withdraw his promise to preserve David’s dynasty. Although the dynasty disappeared for hundreds of years, David’s house and kingdom were renewed in Jesus Christ, the sinless descendant of David who reigns forever.

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 7:16

## 2 Samuel 7:18 (id: 15158)

Israel was set apart from every other nation by the uniqueness of its God and by the relationship the people had with him.

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 7:23

## 2 Samuel 7:24 (id: 15165)

David praised God for his goodness in redeeming and establishing the nation of Israel ([7:23–24](https://ref.ly/2Sam7:23-2Sam7:24)), not just David and his royal line ([7:18–21](https://ref.ly/2Sam7:18-2Sam7:21)). His prayer is corporate rather than just personal.

## 2 Samuel 7:25 (id: 15166)

Confirm it: David was not asking God for a sign (as Gideon had done, [Judg 6:17](https://ref.ly/Judg6:17)). Rather, David was saying, “God, may it be so.”

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 7:25

## 2 Samuel 7:26 (id: 15167)

Although God had promised to make David’s name great ([7:9](https://ref.ly/2Sam7:9)), David was concerned that God’s name be honored. David knew that if God were not the focus of the people’s praise, then David’s dynasty would count for nothing.

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 7:26

## 2 Samuel 8:1–18 (id: 15176)

The expansion of David’s empire through military victories ([8:1–14](https://ref.ly/2Sam8:1-2Sam8:14)) and the establishment of his royal bureaucracy ([8:15–18](https://ref.ly/2Sam8:15-2Sam8:18)) fulfilled God’s promise of a famous name ([7:9](https://ref.ly/2Sam7:9); cp. [8:13](https://ref.ly/2Sam8:13)).

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 8:1–2SA 8:18

## 2 Samuel 8:2 (id: 15182)

Moab was on the east side of the Dead Sea. Earlier, the people of Moab had provided David’s parents with refuge during Saul’s reign ([1 Sam 22:3–4](https://ref.ly/1Sam22:3-1Sam22:4)); David’s great\-grandmother, Ruth, was from Moab. For whatever reason, no such fraternal relationship existed any longer. • two groups to be executed for every one group to be spared: This is the only time in 2 Samuel that David executed captives taken in battle (see [Num 21:29](https://ref.ly/Num21:29); [24:17](https://ref.ly/Num24:17); [Deut 2:9](https://ref.ly/Deut2:9)).

## 2 Samuel 8:3 (id: 15183)

Hadadezer reappears in [10:16](https://ref.ly/2Sam10:16) as David’s foe. He was either the direct son of Rehob and his successor or the reigning king of a dynasty established by a king named Rehob, whose kingdom was near the northern city of Dan (see [Judg 18:28](https://ref.ly/Judg18:28); cp. [Num 13:21](https://ref.ly/Num13:21)). • Zobah was north and east of David’s kingdom. • It is possible that David, not Hadadezer (literally *he*), marched out to strengthen his control. • the Euphrates River: Literally *the river;* [1 Chr 18:3](https://ref.ly/1Chr18:3) specifically identifies the Euphrates. Cp. [2 Sam 10:16](https://ref.ly/2Sam10:16).

David would have crippled . . . horses to prevent their reuse by the enemy and because kings in Israel were not to accumulate horses ([Deut 17:16](https://ref.ly/Deut17:16)).

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 8:4

## 2 Samuel 8:5 (id: 15185)

Hadadezer’s neighbors, Arameans from Damascus, were of no help to him in repelling David. They would later be more successful against Solomon ([1 Kgs 11:23–25](https://ref.ly/1Kgs11:23-1Kgs11:25)) but less successful in their attack of Samaria during the days of King Ahab of Israel ([1 Kgs 20](https://ref.ly/1Kgs20:1-1Kgs20:43)).

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 8:5

## 2 Samuel 8:6 (id: 15186)

David established army garrisons in Aram but not in Moab ([8:2](https://ref.ly/2Sam8:2)), which suggests that Aram was a more formidable force and that David needed a military presence there to maintain control. • the Lord made David victorious: Cp. [8:14](https://ref.ly/2Sam8:14). God was the real source of David’s growth and power.

Hamath was northwest of Hadadezer’s Zobah.

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 8:9

## 2 Samuel 8:10 (id: 15177)

his son: King Toi dispatched the crown prince rather than another entourage on this mission because he considered it vital to stay properly connected with David. • Joram: The prefix *Jo\-* is an abbreviated form of Yahweh; *Joram* means “Yahweh is exalted.” In [1 Chr 18:10](https://ref.ly/1Chr18:10) the prince’s name is Hadoram, which means “Hadad \[a Canaanite god] is exalted.” It is possible that Toi changed the prince’s name for diplomatic reasons, to make it more agreeable to David.

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 8:10

## 2 Samuel 8:11–12 (id: 15178)

Captured war booty and diplomatic exchanges went into God’s treasury rather than the king’s treasury. Voluntary gifts ([8:11a](https://ref.ly/2Sam8:11)) and plunder exacted from defeated foes ([8:11b\-12](https://ref.ly/2Sam8:11-2Sam8:12)) also were dedicated . . . to the Lord.

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 8:11–2SA 8:12

## 2 Samuel 8:13–14 (id: 15179)

These two verses highlight three of David’s war policies: (1\) inflict heavy damage on the enemy (18,000 casualties); (2\) reduce them to vassalage (they became David’s subjects); (3\) place army garrisons in the conquered territory to maintain control over them. • Edomites: This name is very similar to *Arameans* in old Hebrew script. *Edomites* is more likely, however, because the Valley of Salt (the Dead Sea area) was adjacent to Edomite, not Aramean, territory.

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 8:13–2SA 8:14

## 2 Samuel 8:15–18 (id: 15180)

David’s bureaucracy included (1\) military officials (Joab); (2\) a court historian (Jehoshaphat); (3\) priests (Zadok and Ahimelech); (4\) a scribe or court secretary (Seraiah); and (5\) a security officer (Benaiah, who became a commander under Solomon; see also [1 Kgs 2:25–46](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:25-1Kgs2:46)).

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 8:15–2SA 8:18

## 2 Samuel 8:18 (id: 15181)

* The king’s bodyguard included the *Cherethites* and *Pelethites*, who were likely foreigners. The Cherethites might have come from Crete (see also [1 Samuel 30:14](https://ref.ly/1Sam30:14); [Ezekiel 25:16](https://ref.ly/Ezek25:16)). These groups could have been Philistine mercenaries.
* *David’s sons were priestly leaders*: David was from Judah and not a Levite (only people from the tribe of Levi could usually serve as priests). David may have created a new group of religious servants connected to his family line of kings to serve the king's court. This was different from the normal priests who served at the temple (see also study note on 2 Samuel 20:26).

## 2 Samuel 9:1 (id: 15192)

show kindness: The Hebrew word (khesed) speaks of covenant loyalty and faithfulness. The word frequently describes God’s commitment to his people, but it can also describe the devotion and loyalty between any two persons. David’s use of the word here echoes the language of the covenant of friendship between himself and Jonathan ([1 Sam 20:12–17](https://ref.ly/1Sam20:12-1Sam20:17)). • for Jonathan’s sake: Mephibosheth was Saul’s only remaining descendant and the only son of Jonathan.

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 9:1

## 2 Samuel 9:1–13 (id: 15189)

David showed mercy to Mephibosheth, Jonathan’s crippled son. The incident is sandwiched between David’s victories in battle ([8:1–18](https://ref.ly/2Sam8:1-2Sam8:18), [10](https://ref.ly/2Sam8:10)), indicating that David also had concern for individuals and a compassionate heart.

Lo\-debar was a small town in northern Transjordan (the area east of the Jordan), close to Mahanaim, the capital city of Mephibosheth’s late uncle, Ishbosheth. The town was also near Jabesh\-gilead, where Saul first made a name for himself ([1 Sam 11:1–13](https://ref.ly/1Sam11:1-1Sam11:13)). • Makir son of Ammiel*,* Mephibosheth’s host, later supported David during Absalom’s revolt ([2 Sam 17:27](https://ref.ly/2Sam17:27)).

## 2 Samuel 9:5 (id: 15195)

As Saul had once sent for David ([1 Sam 16:19](https://ref.ly/1Sam16:19)), now David sent for Mephibosheth. However, Saul sent for someone to minister to him, whereas David sent for someone to whom he could minister.

## 2 Samuel 9:11 (id: 15190)

Both Ziba and Mephibosheth ([9:6](https://ref.ly/2Sam9:6)) used the phrase “I am your servant” when presenting themselves before King David. By referring to himself as David’s servant, Ziba showed that he was no longer loyal to Saul’s dynasty. The sincerity of both later came into question ([16:1–4](https://ref.ly/2Sam16:1-2Sam16:4); [19:17–30](https://ref.ly/2Sam19:17-2Sam19:30)).

Either Hadadezer was still alive, had regrouped, and revolted in [10:1–19](https://ref.ly/2Sam10:1-2Sam10:19); or possibly [10:1–19](https://ref.ly/2Sam10:1-2Sam10:19) unpacks the events of [8:1–18](https://ref.ly/2Sam8:1-2Sam8:18) as a prelude to [11:1–27](https://ref.ly/2Sam11:1-2Sam11:27).

Following the interlude of ch [9](https://ref.ly/2Sam9:1-2Sam9:13), the narrative returns to David’s military feats. The Ammonites were likely the dominant political power in Transjordan (the area east of the Jordan) during Saul’s reign and the early years of David’s reign.

The city of Jericho had not yet been formally reconstructed (see [1 Kgs 16:34](https://ref.ly/1Kgs16:34)), but the site was located adjacent to the largest and most plentiful spring in the land, so people continued to dwell in the area.

In the spring of the year, the land began to dry out after the heavy winter rains. Kings avoided war during the rainy season. • David stayed behind either because he was irresponsible in carrying out his royal duties or because he trusted Joab to efficiently handle the Ammonite problem (cp.

## 2 Samuel 11:1–27 (id: 14850)

David’s affair with Bathsheba and the murder of her husband Uriah show that David was capable of great failure and cast a dark shadow over David’s life and career.

## 2 Samuel 11:3 (id: 14857)

Bathsheba means “daughter of seven” or “daughter of oath.” Her father Eliam was the son of Ahithophel (see [23:34](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:34)), an adviser sought by David and then by Absalom ([15:12](https://ref.ly/2Sam15:12); [16:23](https://ref.ly/2Sam16:23)). Much to David’s chagrin ([15:31](https://ref.ly/2Sam15:31)), Ahithophel later shifted his allegiance from David to Absalom ([17:1–4](https://ref.ly/2Sam17:1-2Sam17:4), [14](https://ref.ly/2Sam17:14)) and advised Absalom to sleep with David’s concubines on a rooftop, in open view ([16:20–22](https://ref.ly/2Sam16:20-2Sam16:22)). • Uriah is a Hebrew name (meaning “Yahweh \[is] my light”); either he was a foreign mercenary, a convert to Israelite religion, or an Israelite of Hittite heritage. Uriah might also have been a member of the non\-Israelite aristocracy in Jerusalem that predated David’s conquest of the city. He was one of the Thirty—David’s mightiest warriors ([23:39](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:39)).

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 11:3

## 2 Samuel 11:4 (id: 14858)

It is not clear whether Bathsheba came to David’s palace voluntarily. That no protestations are recorded (cp. [13:12–13](https://ref.ly/2Sam13:12-2Sam13:13)) and that she married David, bore him another child, and persuaded him to designate their child as heir ([1 Kgs 1:11–21](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:11-1Kgs1:21)) suggest that she might have been a willing partner. However, Bathsheba mourned for her husband ([2 Sam 11:26–27](https://ref.ly/2Sam11:26-2Sam11:27)), and only David was condemned for this act ([11:27](https://ref.ly/2Sam11:27)), so she might have been violated against her will. • The phrase after having her menstrual period (see [Lev 15:19–24](https://ref.ly/Lev15:19-Lev15:24)) is included to show that the child Bathsheba conceived could not possibly have been Uriah’s.

## 2 Samuel 11:8 (id: 14859)

and relax: David assumed that Uriah would have sex with Bathsheba while on this weekend pass. Then everyone except Bathsheba would assume that the child was Uriah’s, conceived on this night. • a gift: David might not have even cared whether the husband and wife were intimate. Uriah’s return to his house would stifle any rumors as to how and when Bathsheba became pregnant.

## 2 Samuel 11:11 (id: 14851)

in tents (Hebrew, sukkoth*,* the name behind *Sukkot,* “the Festival of Shelters,” [Deut 16:13–17](https://ref.ly/Deut16:13-Deut16:17)): These were temporary structures made of branches and foliage used by soldiers in the field, herdsmen protecting their cattle, or grape harvesters in the vineyard. • wine and dine and sleep with my wife? Uriah was willing to wine and dine with David ([2 Sam 11:13](https://ref.ly/2Sam11:13)), so it was not sharing the table with Bathsheba that Uriah wished to avoid but sharing the marriage bed. The Israelites considered the war camp a holy place because God was present to fight for his people. Thus, soldiers on duty avoided anything that caused impurity, such as sexual intercourse ([Lev 15:18](https://ref.ly/Lev15:18); see also [1 Sam 21:5–6](https://ref.ly/1Sam21:5-1Sam21:6)).

The Lord sent Nathan to David at least nine months after his adulterous sin. • This story is a rare Old Testament instance of a parable (see also [Judg 9:8–15](https://ref.ly/Judg9:8-Judg9:15)). Such stories can be effective for communicating truth. • David was rich in the royal treasures he possessed, the number of wives he had, and all the promises of God for his future.

The rich man of the parable did not deserve to die according to the law; instead, he must repay four lambs (cp. [Exod 22:1](https://ref.ly/Exod22:1)). Intriguingly, David would later lose four of his sons (Bathsheba’s first child, [2 Sam 12:18](https://ref.ly/2Sam12:18); Amnon, [13:29](https://ref.ly/2Sam13:29); Absalom, [18:14–15](https://ref.ly/2Sam18:14-2Sam18:15); Adonijah, [1 Kgs 2:25](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:25)).

You are that man! David did deserve to die for his crime ([Lev 20:10](https://ref.ly/Lev20:10)). • I anointed . . . I gave . . .

Although David repented and was forgiven ([2 Sam 12:13](https://ref.ly/2Sam12:13)), it did not cancel all retribution; it delayed it until a later generation (cp.

Even after Uriah’s death, Bathsheba was still called Uriah’s wife ([12:9](https://ref.ly/2Sam12:9); see also [Matt 1:6](https://ref.ly/Matt1:6)). Only here is she called David’s wife. • Solomon: Pronounced Shelomoh in Hebrew, it probably means “his peace,” from the Hebrew shalom. It might mean “his replacement”; cp. *Shelemiah* ([Jer 36:14](https://ref.ly/Jer36:14), “Yahweh has provided compensation”) and *Shelumiel* ([Num 1:6](https://ref.ly/Num1:6), “God \[is] my compensation”); both contain the root shelem (“replacement, compensation”).

King David . . . was very angry: But he apparently never punished Amnon—as in the Dead Sea Scrolls and Greek version, which add that it was because he loved Amnon. Another possibility is that as an adulterer himself (see [11:1–12:24](https://ref.ly/2Sam11:1-2Sam12:24)), David considered himself in no position to punish his son’s sexual sin. A third possibility is that David thought this was God’s “eye for an eye” punishment for his own sexual indiscretion.

take the Ark of God back: People fleeing invasion normally took their idols to avoid having the items fall into an enemy’s hands. The capture of a god could be interpreted by rebel elements to mean that the gods had abandoned the ruling dynasty. However, the Ark was not a mere idol or talisman (cp. [1 Sam 4:3–11](https://ref.ly/1Sam4:3-1Sam4:11); [5:6–6:9](https://ref.ly/1Sam5:6-1Sam6:9)). It was the central object in the sanctuary and represented the presence of the Lord, the God of Israel (see [Exod 40:34–35](https://ref.ly/Exod40:34-Exod40:35)).

Long live the king! Hushai’s words were deliberately ambiguous. He was in fact an agent of the true king—David was truly “the man . . . chosen by the Lord” ([16:18](https://ref.ly/2Sam16:18)).

why shouldn’t I serve you? (literally *and second, to whom will I do service? Not before his son?*): The ambiguous language continues.

Ahithophel proposed a quick surprise strike against David with a small force (12,000 men, [17:1](https://ref.ly/2Sam17:1)), which would give David no time to organize and fight back. Then David’s double\-agent Hushai suggested taking more time to mobilize the entire army of Israel ([17:11](https://ref.ly/2Sam17:11)). This plan would supposedly give them an insurmountable numerical advantage and prevent David from engaging in guerilla tactics. Because the Lord was working against Absalom, he rejected Ahithophel’s good strategy and accepted Hushai’s bad advice ([17:14](https://ref.ly/2Sam17:14); cp.

asked the Lord: The Hebrew verb is the same as that used when David “begged” for the life of Bathsheba’s child ([12:16](https://ref.ly/2Sam12:16)). On these two occasions, “seeking” was in the desperation of a moment of crisis. However, most often in the Old Testament, “seeking God” refers not to a specific prayer of petition but to the dynamics of daily devotion and obedience to God (e.g., [Pss 40:16](https://ref.ly/Ps40:16); [105:4](https://ref.ly/Ps105:4); [Prov 28:5](https://ref.ly/Prov28:5)). • Saul and his family are guilty: The famine resulted from violating an oath taken before the Lord ([Josh 9:19–20](https://ref.ly/Josh9:19-Josh9:20)). • murdering the Gibeonites: This incident is not elsewhere recorded.

## 2 Samuel 21:1–24.25 (id: 15019)

The final chapters of 2 Samuel are a *coda,* a concluding section that summarizes the important themes from the preceding material. These chapters are thematic, not chronological, and not all the events described here happened at the end of David’s reign (e.g., [22:1](https://ref.ly/2Sam22:1)). The materials are arranged according to a common Hebrew literary device, a *chiasm* (mirror\-image): A: Saul’s sin against the Gibeonites and its collective punishment ([21:1–14](https://ref.ly/2Sam21:1-2Sam21:14)); B: David’s heroes and their exploits ([21:15–22](https://ref.ly/2Sam21:15-2Sam21:22)); C: David’s Psalm ([22:1–51](https://ref.ly/2Sam22:1-2Sam22:51)); C′: David’s Psalm ([23:1–7](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:1-2Sam23:7)); B′: David’s heroes and their exploits ([23:8–39](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:8-2Sam23:39)); A′: David’s sin against the census taboo and its collective punishment ([24:1–25](https://ref.ly/2Sam24:1-2Sam24:25)). A chiasm highlights the central section—here David’s hymns, which focus not on David but on David’s God.

## 2 Samuel 21:2 (id: 15030)

Though the Amorites were a specific people group ([Gen 10:16](https://ref.ly/Gen10:16)), here it is a general term for the pre\-Israelite inhabitants of Canaan. • When properly directed, zeal is commendable (e.g., [Num 25:11](https://ref.ly/Num25:11); [1 Kgs 19:10](https://ref.ly/1Kgs19:10)). Saul’s misdirected zeal, however, involved blatant disregard for Israel’s covenant with the Gibeonites.

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 21:2

## 2 Samuel 21:3 (id: 15031)

Saul’s actions had caused the Gibeonites to curse Israel (cp. [Rom 2:24](https://ref.ly/Rom2:24)); once David had made amends, the Gibeonites would bless the Lord’s people again.

## 2 Samuel 21:6 (id: 15032)

seven of Saul’s sons: Although the law codes of other ancient Near Eastern nations sometimes permitted members of a family to be punished for crimes a guilty individual had committed, [Deut 24:16](https://ref.ly/Deut24:16) prohibited such punishment among the Israelites. This penalty was God’s prerogative alone ([Deut 5:9](https://ref.ly/Deut5:9)). The few instances in the Bible when offspring were punished were not regular criminal cases. Rather, they involved offenses against God, such as violation of the kherem (the taboo on goods in wars of total destruction ordered by God; [Josh 7:24–25](https://ref.ly/Josh7:24-Josh7:25)) or of national oaths (as here). • at Gibeon, on the mountain of the Lord: This probably refers to the high place at Gibeon that Solomon later visited ([1 Kgs 3:3–4](https://ref.ly/1Kgs3:3-1Kgs3:4); [2 Chr 1:3](https://ref.ly/2Chr1:3)).

Armoni and Mephibosheth were Saul’s only two remaining sons. • Saul’s daughter Merab: See NLT note; the NLT follows the Greek here because Michal remained childless ([6:22–23](https://ref.ly/2Sam6:22-2Sam6:23)). Also, Merab was married to Adriel ([1 Sam 18:19](https://ref.ly/1Sam18:19)), whereas Michal’s other husband was Palti ([2 Sam 3:15](https://ref.ly/2Sam3:15)). • Barzillai from Meholah (cp.[1 Sam 18:19](https://ref.ly/1Sam18:19)) should not be confused with Barzillai of Gilead ([2 Sam 19:31](https://ref.ly/2Sam19:31)).

## 2 Samuel 22:1–51 (id: 15036)

Although this prayer of thanksgiving (also recorded in [Ps 18](https://ref.ly/Ps18:1-Ps18:50)) is placed near the end of David’s story, David probably offered it to God much earlier in his life. This prayer and Hannah’s ([1 Sam 2:1–10](https://ref.ly/1Sam2:1-1Sam2:10)) together enclose the book of Samuel with an *inclusio* (literary bookends). Hannah was saved from barrenness; David was saved from his enemies. The placement of this hymn also provides a parallel to Moses. The stories of both Moses and David end with a song or hymn giving lavish praise to God (see also [Deut 31:30–32:43](https://ref.ly/Deut31:30-Deut32:43)). Both highlight God as a “Rock” ([Deut 32:4](https://ref.ly/Deut32:4), [15](https://ref.ly/Deut32:15), [18](https://ref.ly/Deut32:18), [30](https://ref.ly/Deut32:30), [31](https://ref.ly/Deut32:31); [2 Sam 22:2](https://ref.ly/2Sam22:2), [3](https://ref.ly/2Sam22:3), [32](https://ref.ly/2Sam22:32), [47](https://ref.ly/2Sam22:47)). Both are followed by second and shorter poetic pieces—Moses’ final blessing to the Israelite tribes ([Deut 33](https://ref.ly/Deut33:1-Deut33:29)), and David’s last words ([2 Sam 23:1–7](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:1-2Sam23:7)).

Hannah had said, “there is no Rock like our God” ([1 Sam 2:2](https://ref.ly/1Sam2:2)), while David said, the Lord is my rock, which recalls God’s rescue of David from Saul at the Rock of Escape ([1 Sam 23:28](https://ref.ly/1Sam23:28)). The Hebrew word translated “rock” in [22:3](https://ref.ly/2Sam22:3) (different from [22:2](https://ref.ly/2Sam22:2)) refers in [1 Sam 24:2](https://ref.ly/1Sam24:2) to “the rocks of the wild goats,” where Saul suspected that David was hiding. • fortress: The same word referred to David’s physical “stronghold” ([1 Sam 22:4](https://ref.ly/1Sam22:4)), where David and his men sought refuge from Saul.

David’s military accomplishments before he became king were impressive (see [1 Sam 17:12–58](https://ref.ly/1Sam17:12-1Sam17:58); [18:17–30](https://ref.ly/1Sam18:17-1Sam18:30); [23:1–5](https://ref.ly/1Sam23:1-1Sam23:5); [30:1–31](https://ref.ly/1Sam30:1-1Sam30:31)). Yet rather than exalting himself, David glorified God and gave him the credit.

David’s last words were not necessarily the last words he actually spoke (see [1 Kgs 1:16](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:16), [29–30](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:29-1Kgs1:30), [33–35](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:33-1Kgs1:35); [2:1–9](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:1-1Kgs2:9)) but his final public expression of worship to God as king (cp. [1 Sam 12:1–25](https://ref.ly/1Sam12:1-1Sam12:25)). • David . . . speaks: The language indicates that he was about to utter an oracle, a revelation from God ([2 Sam 23:2](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:2)). • the sweet psalmist of Israel: For other references to David as musician and poet, see [1 Chr 23:5](https://ref.ly/1Chr23:5); [2 Chr 29:26](https://ref.ly/2Chr29:26), [27](https://ref.ly/2Chr29:27); [Neh 12:36](https://ref.ly/Neh12:36); [Amos 6:5](https://ref.ly/Amos6:5).

This section is a listing of David’s elite warriors by name, the most prominent of whom are listed with a notable accomplishment. These warriors were some of the “iron tools” that God used to “chop down” the godless ([23:7](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:7)). • The list divides into the Three and the Thirty. Some Hebrew scholars have suggested that *the Thirty* be translated as “Officers.” If that is correct, then it is possible that *the Three* was originally a term for a specific military office.

This water . . . these men: When David poured the hard\-won water on the ground, it did not signal ingratitude. Rather, he regarded the water as equivalent to the warriors’ blood*;* it represented life that only God was worthy to receive ([Lev 17:10–13](https://ref.ly/Lev17:10-Lev17:13); [Deut 12:23–24](https://ref.ly/Deut12:23-Deut12:24)).

## 2 Samuel 23:18–23 (id: 15054)

Here are examples of the prowess of Abishai and Benaiah. Elsewhere, Abishai was intensely combative toward David’s enemies, especially Saul ([1 Sam 26:6–9](https://ref.ly/1Sam26:6-1Sam26:9)) and Saul’s kinsman Shimei ([2 Sam 16:9–11](https://ref.ly/2Sam16:9-2Sam16:11)). Abishai had saved David’s life during one of the Philistine wars ([21:16–17](https://ref.ly/2Sam21:16-2Sam21:17)). • Benaiah appeared first as the commander of the mercenaries who served as David’s bodyguard, independent of the regular army ([8:18](https://ref.ly/2Sam8:18); [20:23](https://ref.ly/2Sam20:23)). He was also the leader of a 24,000\-man division of the regular army that served the king in the third month of every year ([1 Chr 27:5–6](https://ref.ly/1Chr27:5-1Chr27:6)). He played a major role in Solomon’s ascension to the throne ([1 Kgs 1:32–49](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:32-1Kgs1:49)) and became the commander of Solomon’s army, as Joab was for David.

Asahel, David’s nephew, was killed by Abner during the war between David and Ishbosheth ([2:18–32](https://ref.ly/2Sam2:18-2Sam2:32)). Asahel’s inclusion here suggests that parts of these lists go back to the beginning of David’s career. • Elhanan son of Dodo should not be confused with Elhanan son of Jair ([21:19](https://ref.ly/2Sam21:19); [1 Chr 20:5](https://ref.ly/1Chr20:5)).

## 2 Samuel 23:39 (id: 15058)

The very last name mentioned is Uriah the Hittite. There is an earlier reference to his father\-in\-law, Eliam, father of Bathsheba ([23:34](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:34); see [11:3](https://ref.ly/2Sam11:3)). By contrast, the Chronicler, who never mentioned David’s sins against Bathsheba and Uriah, placed Uriah’s name inconspicuously in the middle of the list of David’s mighty men ([1 Chr 11:10–47](https://ref.ly/1Chr11:10-1Chr11:47)). This author not only described the sins ([2 Sam 11:1–27](https://ref.ly/2Sam11:1-2Sam11:27)) but puts emphasis on Uriah’s name by placing it at the end of this list. Uriah was no ordinary conscript but a loyal member of David’s elite guard, which makes David’s treachery against him all the worse. • There were thirty\-seven in all: Only thirty\-six names are mentioned, assuming that “Shammah . . . from Harar” ([23:11](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:11)) is different from “Shammah from Harod” ([23:25](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:25)), and that “Benaiah son of Jehoiada” ([23:20](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:20)) is different from “Benaiah from Pirathon” ([23:30](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:30)). Perhaps the thirty\-seventh warrior was Joab, who is mentioned only peripherally ([23:18](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:18), [37](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:37)) and is absent from the list of names. Many commentators say that he is excluded because he was David’s chief military leader and did not need to be included. The omission could also represent David’s long and troubled association with Joab, who was eventually executed when Solomon carried out David’s deathbed command ([1 Kgs 2:5–6](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:5-1Kgs2:6), [28–34](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:28-1Kgs2:34)).

## 2 Samuel 24:1 (id: 15067)

The reason God’s anger . . . burned against Israel is unknown (but see [Deut 4:25](https://ref.ly/Deut4:25); [6:14–15](https://ref.ly/Deut6:14-Deut6:15); [29:22–28](https://ref.ly/Deut29:22-Deut29:28); [31:16–18](https://ref.ly/Deut31:16-Deut31:18)). • Caused . . . to harm reflects a Hebrew verb (suth) used elsewhere in the sense of enticing or inciting someone to do wrong ([1 Sam 26:19](https://ref.ly/1Sam26:19), “stirred you up against me”). Census\-taking was usually unpopular with citizens, who resented it as an intrusion into their private affairs. They regarded it as a prelude to taxation or forced military service (see study note on 2 Sam 24:9). If David was motivated by pride or was preparing for an illegitimate war (as [24:9](https://ref.ly/2Sam24:9) might suggest), this might explain why it was a sin for him ([24:10](https://ref.ly/2Sam24:10)).

The phrase capable warriors shows that the census focused largely on those fit for military service.

Unlike pagan magicians or sorcerers, biblical seers had divinely inspired visions (see also [2 Kgs 17:13](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:13); [Isa 29:10](https://ref.ly/Isa29:10); [30:9–10](https://ref.ly/Isa30:9-Isa30:10); [Amos 7:12](https://ref.ly/Amos7:12); [Mic 3:7](https://ref.ly/Mic3:7)) and functioned as God’s messengers.
