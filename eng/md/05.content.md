## Deuteronomy 1:1 (id: 10140)

These are the words that Moses spoke: Although Deuteronomy is modeled after a covenant or treaty document, it is essentially a series of addresses delivered by Moses to the assembly of Israel. • the Jordan Valley: Hebrew *the Arabah*, a common word usually translated “wilderness” or “desert.” It generally refers to the Great Rift Valley that extends from the Sea of Galilee southward to the Red Sea (the Gulf of Aqaba). In this context, the Arabah is the wasteland of the lower Jordan River, just north of the Dead Sea.

## Deuteronomy 1:1–5 (id: 10133)

Ancient Near Eastern treaty texts usually began with a brief section introducing the partners in the covenant, their relationship to each other, and their immediate ancestry. This introduction provides information primarily about the social and geographic setting.

## Deuteronomy 1:2 (id: 10144)

The distance from Mount Sinai in the southern part of the Sinai Peninsula to Kadesh\-barnea (see study note on 1:19) in the north is only 150 miles. Even the massive Hebrew population could easily have covered this distance in eleven days had they proceeded without detour or interruption. Their rebellion against the Lord resulted in a 38\-year delay and a circuitous route ([2:14](https://ref.ly/Deut2:14); [Num 14:34](https://ref.ly/Num14:34)). • Mount Sinai: Hebrew *Horeb,* the name consistently used in Deuteronomy for the sacred mountain where the covenant was given. Its likely connection to a word meaning “drought” or “devastation” suggests the conditions the people of Israel had to face. • The way of Mount Seir was the route from Mount Sinai to Mount Seir. Seir*,* another name for Edom, was located east\-southeast of the Dead Sea. The ordinary route took travelers through the Arabah north from the Gulf of Aqaba and then west to Kadesh\-barnea, sixty miles southwest of the Dead Sea.

## Deuteronomy 1:4 (id: 10151)

The Amorites were a Semitic people, linguistically related to the Canaanites. They originally lived in what is now north\-central Syria, but they had migrated into Canaan to settle on both sides of the Jordan River, primarily in the hill country. At the time of Israel’s conquest, many Amorites lived in Transjordan (east of the Jordan), north of the Arnon River, with their capital at Heshbon (see also study note on Num 21:13). The Israelites had already displaced many of them before this time ([Num 22:21–35](https://ref.ly/Num22:21-Num22:35)). • Bashan was also an Amorite area, located north of the Yarmuk River and east of the Sea of Galilee. It was known for its prized livestock (cp. [Ps 22:12](https://ref.ly/Ps22:12); [Ezek 39:18](https://ref.ly/Ezek39:18); [Amos 4:1](https://ref.ly/Amos4:1) and study note). Its capital was Ashtaroth. • The kings Sihon and Og are not known outside the Bible (see [Num 21:21–35](https://ref.ly/Num21:21-Num21:35)).

## Deuteronomy 1:6–4.40 (id: 10152)

Secular treaties typically included a section detailing the past relations between the treaty partners. The purpose here was to point out Israel’s successes and failures since the Exodus and to remind the people that God had been true to his word regardless of how they had acted toward him. In order to prepare the Israelites for life in Canaan, Moses reminded them of life in Egypt, of the forty years of wandering in the wilderness, and of their past blunders. He warned them to obey God’s covenant and assured them that God’s grace would follow them as they learned to trust and obey the Lord.

* **Associated Passages:** DEU 1:6–DEU 3:29

## Deuteronomy 1:7 (id: 10153)

The hill country consisted of interior areas of Canaan that were also inhabited by the Amorites (see [1:4](https://ref.ly/Deut1:4); [Num 13:29](https://ref.ly/Num13:29); [Josh 10:6](https://ref.ly/Josh10:6)). The Canaanites apparently once lived throughout Palestine, but with the incursion of the Amorites they were restricted to the valleys and lowlands. • the western foothills: Hebrew *the Shephelah,* the term still used in modern Israel for the region between the hills of Judah and the coastal plain, an area that specializes in orchards and vineyards. • the Negev: This great desert area lies to the south of Canaan. The Hebrew word could also designate “the south.”

* **Associated Passages:** DEU 1:7

## Deuteronomy 1:8 (id: 10154)

occupy it (literally *acquire it as an inheritance*): The land was already Israel’s because God had promised it to the nation’s ancestors centuries earlier ([Gen 15:18–21](https://ref.ly/Gen15:18-Gen15:21); [26:3](https://ref.ly/Gen26:3); [Exod 23:31](https://ref.ly/Exod23:31)). Israel was not seizing new territory from its rightful owners but was taking possession of land occupied by squatters.

## Deuteronomy 1:10 (id: 10134)

as numerous as the stars: This figure of speech deliberately exaggerates for effect. Abraham’s descendants had not approached the actual number of stars in the universe, though they exceeded the number of stars visible to the naked eye. Moses meant that God had begun fulfilling his promises to Abraham (see [Gen 15:5](https://ref.ly/Gen15:5); [22:17](https://ref.ly/Gen22:17)) by making Israel numerous, bringing them to the Promised Land, and preparing them to conquer it.

## Deuteronomy 1:13 (id: 10135)

Those who were well\-respected had lives and reputations that were above reproach, even on close scrutiny.

* **Associated Passages:** DEU 1:13

## Deuteronomy 1:15 (id: 10136)

thousand . . . hundred . . . fifty . . . ten: This was standard military organization, so some of these officials were probably military officers (see [1 Sam 8:12](https://ref.ly/1Sam8:12); [22:7](https://ref.ly/1Sam22:7); [2 Sam 18:1](https://ref.ly/2Sam18:1)).

* **Associated Passages:** DEU 1:15

## Deuteronomy 1:16–17 (id: 10137)

Be . . . impartial (literally *Do not notice faces*): People appearing before the court should be treated as though they were wearing a mask to conceal their identity. Judges were not to be influenced by rich and powerful persons in the community but were to judge on the basis of God’s own impartiality ([10:17](https://ref.ly/Deut10:17)) and treat all persons equally under the law.

* **Associated Passages:** DEU 1:16–DEU 1:17

## Deuteronomy 1:19 (id: 10139)

Kadesh\-barnea*,* a great oasis with abundant wells and springs, was about fifty miles south of Beersheba, the traditional southern point of Israel (see[2 Sam 3:10](https://ref.ly/2Sam3:10); [1 Chr 21:2](https://ref.ly/1Chr21:2)).

## Deuteronomy 1:28 (id: 10143)

Anak was a well\-known man of gigantic physical stature ([2:10](https://ref.ly/Deut2:10), [21](https://ref.ly/Deut2:21); [9:2](https://ref.ly/Deut9:2); [Num 13:33](https://ref.ly/Num13:33)). Goliath ([1 Sam 17:4](https://ref.ly/1Sam17:4)) might have been one of the descendants of Anak who migrated to the Philistine coastal plain ([Deut 2:23](https://ref.ly/Deut2:23); [Josh 11:21–23](https://ref.ly/Josh11:21-Josh11:23); [15:14](https://ref.ly/Josh15:14); [1 Chr 20:4–8](https://ref.ly/1Chr20:4-1Chr20:8)).

* **Associated Passages:** DEU 1:28

## Deuteronomy 1:30 (id: 10145)

He will fight for you: This phrase refers to the defeat of the Canaanite nations. The Lord would initiate the battle, lead it, fight it, and bring it to a successful conclusion. The only other use of this phrase refers to God’s activity in the Exodus ([Exod 14:14](https://ref.ly/Exod14:14)).

* **Associated Passages:** DEU 1:30

## Deuteronomy 1:31 (id: 10146)

God’s tender care as a father reflected his covenant relationship with Israel ([Exod 4:22](https://ref.ly/Exod4:22); [Hos 11:1–4](https://ref.ly/Hos11:1-Hos11:4); cp. [Matt 6:26–33](https://ref.ly/Matt6:26-Matt6:33); [John 14:21](https://ref.ly/John14:21); [Acts 13:18](https://ref.ly/Acts13:18); [Rom 8:15–17](https://ref.ly/Rom8:15-Rom8:17); [1 Pet 1:2–3](https://ref.ly/1Pet1:2-1Pet1:3); [1 Jn 3:1](https://ref.ly/1John3:1)). Israel was God’s child by descent from Abraham and because God had chosen and adopted Israel from among all the nations ([Deut 14:2](https://ref.ly/Deut14:2); [Exod 19:4–6](https://ref.ly/Exod19:4-Exod19:6)). The imagery is similar to that found in secular covenant texts in which a great king regarded a vassal with whom he had made a treaty as his son.

* **Associated Passages:** DEU 1:31

## Deuteronomy 1:33 (id: 10147)

Physical manifestations of God (called *theophanies*), such as the pillar of fire and the pillar of cloud, assured God’s people of his presence and power. As he moved forward by these visible displays, they could also move, knowing that he would faithfully lead them to their final destination ([Exod 13:21–22](https://ref.ly/Exod13:21-Exod13:22); [14:24](https://ref.ly/Exod14:24); [Ps 18:9–10](https://ref.ly/Ps18:9-Ps18:10)).

* **Associated Passages:** DEU 1:33

## Deuteronomy 1:36 (id: 10148)

Caleb was one of the twelve spies whom Moses sent to discern the political and military situation in Canaan. Caleb and Joshua alone brought back the report that God would give Israel success in conquering Canaan ([Num 13:6](https://ref.ly/Num13:6), [8](https://ref.ly/Num13:8), [16](https://ref.ly/Num13:16), [30](https://ref.ly/Num13:30)). Caleb later became the father\-in\-law of Othniel, Israel’s first judge ([Judg 1:13](https://ref.ly/Judg1:13)). For his faithfulness, Caleb was given the vicinity of Hebron as his inheritance, and he expelled the Anakites (see [Josh 14:12–15](https://ref.ly/Josh14:12-Josh14:15); [Judg 1:20](https://ref.ly/Judg1:20)).

* **Associated Passages:** DEU 1:36

## Deuteronomy 1:37 (id: 10149)

God was angry with me because of you: In his frustration against rebellious Israel, Moses had disobeyed God by striking the rock rather than merely speaking to it ([Num 20:10–13](https://ref.ly/Num20:10-Num20:13)).

* **Associated Passages:** DEU 1:37

## Deuteronomy 1:44 (id: 10150)

Hormah is perhaps modern Khirbet el\-Meshash, a site seven miles southeast of Beersheba. The ancient name is derived from the verb kharam*,* which means to “devastate” or “annihilate.” The Israelites indeed devastated Hormah ([Num 14:45](https://ref.ly/Num14:45); [21:3](https://ref.ly/Num21:3)).

* **Associated Passages:** DEU 1:44

## Deuteronomy 2:1 (id: 10267)

Mount Seir was a mountainous territory north of the Gulf of Aqaba, east of the Arabah (see study note on 1:1) and the Dead Sea. It was originally settled by the Horites ([Gen 14:6](https://ref.ly/Gen14:6)), now identified by many scholars as the Hurrians. The Hurrians are described in many ancient texts as wandering tradesmen and adventurers who found a home in many parts of the ancient Near East. In time, the Horites of Mount Seir were supplanted by the descendants of Esau ([Deut 2:22](https://ref.ly/Deut2:22)), and the region was called Edom (“red”), perhaps because of the rose\-red stone typical of the area.

## Deuteronomy 2:5 (id: 10278)

I have given them: God’s gift of a promised land was not limited to Israel. He also distributed lands to Edom, Moab ([2:9](https://ref.ly/Deut2:9)), Ammon ([2:19](https://ref.ly/Deut2:19)), and the Caphtorites ([2:22–23](https://ref.ly/Deut2:22-Deut2:23)). Although God had chosen Israel as a special nation ([1:31](https://ref.ly/Deut1:31); see also [7:6](https://ref.ly/Deut7:6); [14:2](https://ref.ly/Deut14:2); [Exod 19:5](https://ref.ly/Exod19:5)), he is also the God of all nations and has a place and purpose for each ([Deut 32:8](https://ref.ly/Deut32:8); [Acts 17:26](https://ref.ly/Acts17:26))—even for those that do not recognize his sovereignty ([Rom 1:16–23](https://ref.ly/Rom1:16-Rom1:23)).

* **Associated Passages:** DEU 2:5

## Deuteronomy 2:8 (id: 10279)

our relatives: Isaac had two sons, Esau, the firstborn, and Jacob, who obtained Esau’s birthright and blessing as the firstborn ([Gen 25:27–34](https://ref.ly/Gen25:27-Gen25:34); [27:1–36](https://ref.ly/Gen27:1-Gen27:36)). The result was intense hostility between Esau and Jacob and between their descendants. Israel still recognized and honored the kinship, however; out of fraternal good faith, if not affection, Israel bypassed Edom and did not engage the Edomites in battle (see [Num 20:14–21](https://ref.ly/Num20:14-Num20:21)). • Arabah Valley: See study note on Deut 1:1. • Elath and Ezion\-geber were twin port cities on the Red Sea. They later harbored the merchant ships of Solomon ([1 Kgs 9:26](https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:26)), Jehoshaphat ([1 Kgs 22:48](https://ref.ly/1Kgs22:48)), and Uzziah ([2 Kgs 14:22](https://ref.ly/2Kgs14:22)).

## Deuteronomy 2:9 (id: 10280)

Following the destruction of Sodom, Gomorrah, and the other cities of the plain, Lot (Abraham’s nephew and Isaac’s cousin) and his two unmarried daughters sheltered in a cave east of the Dead Sea (see [Gen 19:30–38](https://ref.ly/Gen19:30-Gen19:38)), where Lot’s daughters plied their father with drink until he had sexual relations with them. Their descendants became the nations of Moab and Ammon. Because of their kinship with Israel, the Moabites were to be left undisturbed. David’s great\-grandmother Ruth descended from Moab ([Ruth 1:4](https://ref.ly/Ruth1:4)), and David sent his own family to the land of Moab for protection when he was pursued by Saul ([1 Sam 22:3–5](https://ref.ly/1Sam22:3-1Sam22:5)). • Ar was probably the capital of Moab.

## Deuteronomy 2:10 (id: 10262)

The Emites were also located at Shaveh\-kiriathaim ([Gen 14:5](https://ref.ly/Gen14:5)), perhaps ten miles east of the Dead Sea’s north end.

## Deuteronomy 2:11 (id: 10263)

The Rephaites lived near Ashteroth\-karnaim ([Gen 14:5](https://ref.ly/Gen14:5); perhaps modern Tell Ashtarah), due east of the Sea of Galilee (see [Deut 1:4](https://ref.ly/Deut1:4)).

* **Associated Passages:** DEU 2:11

## Deuteronomy 2:12 (id: 10264)

just as Israel drove out: The Hebrew does not include the phrase the people of Canaan. This passage is often cited as a later addition to Deuteronomy because it seems to presuppose the conquest under Joshua. However, it refers in part to the defeat of peoples east of the Jordan, such as the Amorites under King Sihon and King Og ([3:12–17](https://ref.ly/Deut3:12-Deut3:17)).

* **Associated Passages:** DEU 2:12

## Deuteronomy 2:19 (id: 10266)

Like the Moabites, the Ammonites were descendants of the incestuous relationship between Lot and his daughters (see study note on 2:9). Throughout most of their history, the Ammonites lived south and east of the Jabbok River. The nation’s capital was Rabbath Ammon (modern Amman, Jordan). David arranged for Uriah, Bathsheba’s husband, to be slain in the siege of this city ([2 Sam 11:1](https://ref.ly/2Sam11:1), [14–21](https://ref.ly/2Sam11:14-2Sam11:21)).

The Zamzummites are probably the same as the Zuzites ([Gen 14:5](https://ref.ly/Gen14:5)). The Lord had removed them from the land in the past so that the Ammonites could occupy their lands. The God of Israel is also the God of all the earth; he is mindful of all nations and has a place and purpose for each.

## Deuteronomy 2:23 (id: 10270)

The Caphtorites were descendants of Ham and were originally from Crete, a large island south of the Greek peninsula. The Caphtorites are usually identified with the Philistines (see [Gen 10:6–14](https://ref.ly/Gen10:6-Gen10:14); [1 Chr 1:8–12](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:8-1Chr1:12)). The Philistine presence in Canaan resulted from two separate movements, one in the time of the Hebrew patriarchs (see study note on Gen 21:32) and another that began about 1200 BC (see study notes on Josh 13:2; Judg 3:3). This passage apparently refers to the earlier settlement. • The Avvites were indigenous inhabitants of the lower Mediterranean coastal plain; they were supplanted in Gaza by the early wave of Philistines (cp. [Josh 13:2–4](https://ref.ly/Josh13:2-Josh13:4)).

## Deuteronomy 2:24 (id: 10271)

The Arnon Gorge is the deep canyon formed by the Arnon River; it sometimes marked the border between Moab and Edom (see [Num 21:13](https://ref.ly/Num21:13)). It rises deep in the Arabian Desert and empties into the Dead Sea midway along its eastern shore. • Sihon the Amorite controlled the area east of the Jordan, north of the Arnon, and south of the Ammonite territories (see [Num 21:21–35](https://ref.ly/Num21:21-Num21:35)). He is not known outside of the Bible. His capital, Heshbon*,* was probably about fifteen miles southwest of Rabbath Ammon and is usually identified with the impressive ruins at Tell Hesban.

* **Associated Passages:** DEU 2:24

## Deuteronomy 2:26 (id: 10273)

The wilderness of Kedemoth might refer to the area north of the Arnon Gorge between Dibon and Mattanah ([Josh 13:18](https://ref.ly/Josh13:18); [21:37](https://ref.ly/Josh21:37)).

## Deuteronomy 2:30 (id: 10274)

made Sihon stubborn and defiant (literally *had hardened his spirit and strengthened his heart*): Like Pharaoh (see [Exod 7:13](https://ref.ly/Exod7:13)), Sihon was incorrigibly unrepentant and thus experienced God’s wrath. God knew that any further extension of grace to these rulers would be useless. Mystery surrounds the relationship between statements that people harden their own hearts (e.g., [Exod 7:13](https://ref.ly/Exod7:13), [22](https://ref.ly/Exod7:22); [8:15](https://ref.ly/Exod8:15)) and statements that God hardens people’s hearts (e.g., [Exod 4:21](https://ref.ly/Exod4:21); [7:3](https://ref.ly/Exod7:3); [9:12](https://ref.ly/Exod9:12)). What is clear is that God appeals for repentance and is ready to forgive, but when people continually ignore or reject his appeals, they can become incapable of hearing and obeying God (see “Hardened Hearts” Theme Note; [Rom 1:21–28](https://ref.ly/Rom1:21-Rom1:28); [9:17–24](https://ref.ly/Rom9:17-Rom9:24)).

## Deuteronomy 2:34 (id: 10275)

completely destroyed (Hebrew kharam): The Hebrew term refers to the complete consecration of things or people to the Lord, either by destroying them or by giving them as an offering. The underlying rationale was to maintain the Lord’s holiness in the face of pagan idolatry and moral corruption (see also [Lev 27:28–29](https://ref.ly/Lev27:28-Lev27:29)).

Aroer*,* on the north rim of the Arnon Gorge three miles from Dibon, marked the southernmost extent of the Amorite kingdom ([3:12](https://ref.ly/Deut3:12); [4:48](https://ref.ly/Deut4:48); [Josh 12:2](https://ref.ly/Josh12:2); [13:9](https://ref.ly/Josh13:9), [16](https://ref.ly/Josh13:16), [25](https://ref.ly/Josh13:25)). • The identity of the town in the gorge is uncertain. • Gilead, famous for its balm and other aromatic spices ([Jer 8:22](https://ref.ly/Jer8:22); [46:11](https://ref.ly/Jer46:11)), lay north of the Jabbok River, the northernmost border of the Amorites under Sihon.

* **Associated Passages:** DEU 2:36

## Deuteronomy 2:37 (id: 10277)

Like the Moabites, the Ammonites were related to Israel and were thus to be left undisturbed (cp. [2:9](https://ref.ly/Deut2:9)). • The Jabbok River*,* a great tributary of the Jordan River, marked the border between Gilead to the north and the Amorite kingdom of Sihon to the south. The Ammonites lived east and south of the Jabbok ([2:19](https://ref.ly/Deut2:19)). It was somewhere at the Jabbok that Jacob wrestled with the stranger at night ([Gen 32:22–32](https://ref.ly/Gen32:22-Gen32:32)).

## Deuteronomy 3:9 (id: 10424)

The alternative names Sirion and Senir suggest that Hermon was perhaps a later name given by the Israelites. Hermon is apparently related to the verb kharam*,* which means “to destroy” (see study note on 2:34), and perhaps describes the destruction summarized in [3:3–7](https://ref.ly/Deut3:3-Deut3:7).

The half\-tribe of Manasseh made the same request as Reuben and Gad ([3:12](https://ref.ly/Deut3:12)), and Moses accepted their request. Gad and Reuben settled between the Arnon (see [2:24](https://ref.ly/Deut2:24)) and the middle of Gilead (see [2:36](https://ref.ly/Deut2:36)), and Manasseh took everything north of that, including Bashan (see [3:1](https://ref.ly/Deut3:1)). • The Rephaites*,* a giant people related to the Anakites (see[2:11](https://ref.ly/Deut2:11)), are noted here as being indigenous to Bashan.

## Deuteronomy 4:13 (id: 10519)

The covenant is the key theological idea of Deuteronomy and perhaps of the entire Old Testament. A covenant was a legal arrangement involving two or more parties who entered into agreements with mutually binding obligations. The covenant at Sinai ([Exod 20–23](https://ref.ly/Exod20:1-Exod23:33)) codified this relationship between the Lord and Israel; in Deuteronomy, Moses interpreted and expanded the covenant for the new generation that was about to conquer and occupy the Promised Land. • The Ten Commandments (literally *the ten words*, “decalogue”) are so much at the heart of the covenant text and its requirements as to be equated with the covenant. The first four *words* regulate relationship with God, while the last six regulate human relationships. • two stone tablets: All legal documents, including covenant texts, were copied for the benefit of all involved parties. God had his copy (the stone tablets) laid inside the Ark of the Covenant in the sanctuary (see [Exod 25:16](https://ref.ly/Exod25:16), [21](https://ref.ly/Exod25:21); [31:18](https://ref.ly/Exod31:18); [40:20](https://ref.ly/Exod40:20); cp. [Deut 31:26](https://ref.ly/Deut31:26)); Israel’s copy was written in the books of Exodus ([Exod 20:1–17](https://ref.ly/Exod20:1-Exod20:17)) and Deuteronomy ([Deut 5:6–21](https://ref.ly/Deut5:6-Deut5:21)).

Any *form* of the Lord could become an object of worship in lieu of worshiping God himself.

* **Associated Passages:** DEU 4:15

## Deuteronomy 4:16 (id: 10521)

idol: Idolatry inherently confined the Lord to the artist’s imagination. Israel was not to make idols in the form of any of his creatures ([4:17–18](https://ref.ly/Deut4:17-Deut4:18)). Idols and images could lead to worship of the creature rather than the Creator ([5:8–9](https://ref.ly/Deut5:8-Deut5:9); [Rom 1:23–25](https://ref.ly/Rom1:23-Rom1:25)).

## Deuteronomy 4:19 (id: 10522)

forces of heaven: This phrase refers to the stars and other heavenly bodies, which, like earthly creations, were thought to embody or represent deities.

## Deuteronomy 4:20 (id: 10524)

An iron\-smelting furnace was used to refine metal ores and separate the pure metal from the dross. Israel’s trials in Egypt made the Israelites more spiritually and morally pure. • special possession (literally *people of inheritance*): Israel itself was God’s inheritance. This concept is confirmed by the parallel phrase describing Israel as his very own people. As such, the Israelites were now fit to enter, conquer, and occupy the land (cp. [1 Pet 2:9–12](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:9-1Pet2:12)).

* **Associated Passages:** DEU 4:20

## Deuteronomy 4:24 (id: 10525)

God does not have the petty human emotion of jealousy.

## Deuteronomy 4:26 (id: 10526)

Heaven and earth would be witnesses against Israel if the people were disloyal to the Lord. In a covenant partnership, the parties to the agreement were held accountable to the oaths of loyalty and commitment they made to each other in the presence of witnesses ([Isa 1:2–7](https://ref.ly/Isa1:2-Isa1:7); [Mic 6:1–8](https://ref.ly/Mic6:1-Mic6:8)).

## Deuteronomy 4:41–43 (id: 10534)

When Israel settled in Canaan and adopted an urban lifestyle, crimes such as homicide would inevitably need judicial resolution. In order to protect alleged perpetrators from premature vengeance and to guarantee them a fair trial, they needed safe haven in accessible cities of refuge. These towns were first assigned east of the Jordan and later in Canaan (see [Num 35:9–28](https://ref.ly/Num35:9-Num35:28)). The laws governing these matters occur again in [Deut 19:1–13](https://ref.ly/Deut19:1-Deut19:13), but they appear here because of the just\-mentioned promise of a long and safe life in the land ([4:40](https://ref.ly/Deut4:40)).

## Deuteronomy 7:1 (id: 10575)

The Hittites were native to Anatolia (now north\-central Turkey). They established colonies in far\-flung areas such as Syria and were also linked to Canaan in the list of ancient nations (see [Gen 10:15](https://ref.ly/Gen10:15); [23:3–20](https://ref.ly/Gen23:3-Gen23:20)). The Hittite empire came to a sudden end around 1200 BC, but people known as Hittites continued to live in Israel (e.g., Uriah the Hittite, [2 Sam 11:3](https://ref.ly/2Sam11:3); [23:39](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:39)). It is impossible to prove that the Hittites of Anatolia were the same as those mentioned in the OT, but some commonality is probable. • Girgashites were an otherwise unknown Canaanite people ([Gen 10:16–17](https://ref.ly/Gen10:16-Gen10:17)). • Amorites: See study note on Deut 1:4. • The Canaanites were the native people of Canaan; their habitation there can be traced back to 3000 BC. They descended from Noah’s son Ham (see [Gen 9:18–27](https://ref.ly/Gen9:18-Gen9:27)). • The Perizzites are not listed in the Table of Nations ([Gen 10:16–17](https://ref.ly/Gen10:16-Gen10:17)), so they might not have been related to the Canaanites. • Many scholars identify the Hivites as the Horites (or Hurrians; see study note on Deut 2:1), a non\-Semitic people found throughout the ancient Near East. • The Jebusites were associated with Jerusalem ([Judg 1:21](https://ref.ly/Judg1:21); [2 Sam 5:6–8](https://ref.ly/2Sam5:6-2Sam5:8)). David bought a piece of land from Araunah the Jebusite to build an altar ([2 Sam 24:15–25](https://ref.ly/2Sam24:15-2Sam24:25)); this property later became the site of the Temple ([2 Chr 3:1](https://ref.ly/2Chr3:1)).

Here, God is figuratively described as having only a human knowledge of the future, but other passages make it clear that God knows everything—past, present, and future ([Ps 139:1–18](https://ref.ly/Ps139:1-Ps139:18); [Heb 4:13](https://ref.ly/Heb4:13)).

doing as you please: Until the Exodus, the Israelites probably worshiped at multiple shrines in Egypt. With the construction of the Tabernacle, worship was centralized and remained so with the later building of the Temple. In the future, the community would be required to assemble on stated occasions to worship the Lord collectively at the central sanctuary, although local worship by individuals, families, and even villages would continue (see [Exod 20:24–26](https://ref.ly/Exod20:24-Exod20:26); [1 Sam 9:11–14](https://ref.ly/1Sam9:11-1Sam9:14)).

[Lev 17:8–9](https://ref.ly/Lev17:8-Lev17:9)); if not, the animal could be sacrificed locally, but the blood still had to be disposed of in a ritually appropriate manner ([Deut 12:23–25](https://ref.ly/Deut12:23-Deut12:25); cp.

The instruction for witnesses to throw the first stones guarded against unfounded allegations. False testimony carried serious consequences. Requiring a witness to take the leading role in an execution helped guarantee the reliability of his testimony; he would personally bear the guilt if he took the life of an innocent person (see [John 8:1–11](https://ref.ly/John8:1-John8:11)). • The people would purge the evil from among you by executing those whose sin brought the stain of guilt upon the community of Israel (see “Purge the Evil” Theme Note; cp. [1 Cor 5:12–13](https://ref.ly/1Cor5:12-1Cor5:13) and study note).

## Deuteronomy 17:15 (id: 10232)

the man the Lord your God chooses: Human monarchy was not contrary to God’s will for Israel (cp. [1 Sam 8:6–7](https://ref.ly/1Sam8:6-1Sam8:7))—God promised Abraham and Sarah that their descendants would include kings ([Gen 17:6](https://ref.ly/Gen17:6), [16](https://ref.ly/Gen17:16); see also [Gen 35:11](https://ref.ly/Gen35:11)). But the abuses of kingship were condemned. The theology that views the Messiah in a kingly role ([2 Sam 7:11–15](https://ref.ly/2Sam7:11-2Sam7:15); [Pss 2](https://ref.ly/Ps2:1-Ps2:12); [110](https://ref.ly/Ps110:1-Ps110:7); [Isa 9:6–7](https://ref.ly/Isa9:6-Isa9:7)) provides for both human and divine royalty.

In the ancient world, kings married many wives to cement political alliances with other kingdoms, showing trust in human power rather than God’s provision. David ([2 Sam 5:13](https://ref.ly/2Sam5:13); [12:11](https://ref.ly/2Sam12:11)) and Solomon ([1 Kgs 11:3–4](https://ref.ly/1Kgs11:3-1Kgs11:4)) both ignored this warning to their own great harm and that of the nation. • must not accumulate: The amassing of wealth was another sign of dependence on human resources.

## Deuteronomy 18:1 (id: 10248)

The term Levitical priests described the entire tribe of Levi. Technically, however, only Aaron’s descendants were priests. The non\-priestly Levites were their assistants (see [12:12](https://ref.ly/Deut12:12)).

* **Associated Passages:** DEU 18:1

## Deuteronomy 18:2 (id: 10250)

The Lord himself is their special possession: The allotment of the Levites was spiritual, not territorial or material. They possessed the Lord by giving their whole lives to his service. This idea is a remarkable inverse of the idea that Israel was the Lord’s possession (see [7:6](https://ref.ly/Deut7:6)).

## Deuteronomy 18:3 (id: 10251)

In the dietary fare of ancient Israel, the shoulder, the cheeks, and the stomach of oxen and sheep were the choice cuts. God’s priestly servants were to be honored by receiving the very best (see [Lev 7:28–34](https://ref.ly/Lev7:28-Lev7:34)).

support from his family: Although Levites were in full\-time ministry at the Tabernacle and (later) the Temple, they could still hold material assets of their own (see [Num 35:1–8](https://ref.ly/Num35:1-Num35:8)). The Levites were to be supported by the regular offerings designated for that purpose without having to forfeit any of their own assets.

## Deuteronomy 18:10 (id: 10243)

never sacrifice your son or daughter as a burnt offering: Some Canaanite religions included child sacrifice to appease their gods. Israel was strictly warned never to engage in this practice ([Exod 34:15–16](https://ref.ly/Exod34:15-Exod34:16); [Lev 18:21](https://ref.ly/Lev18:21); [20:2–5](https://ref.ly/Lev20:2-Lev20:5)). When they did, it aroused God’s judgment ([2 Kgs 17:16–17](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:16-2Kgs17:17); [21:6](https://ref.ly/2Kgs21:6); [Ezek 23:37](https://ref.ly/Ezek23:37)). • fortune\-telling: Throughout the ancient Near East, diviners were considered experts at reading and interpreting omens. Divination was commonly done through *extispicy,* the examination of livers, kidneys, and other internal organs of various animals. • sorcery: Sorcerers conjured up the spirits of the dead. • Divining cups were often used to interpret omens (see [Gen 44:5](https://ref.ly/Gen44:5)). Drops of oil would be placed in containers of water, and the spread of the oil communicated some message to the expert. A parallel would be reading tea leaves. • The practice of witchcraft included performing unusual acts or signs ([Exod 7:11](https://ref.ly/Exod7:11)) to mislead people ([Mal 3:5](https://ref.ly/Mal3:5)).

* **Associated Passages:** DEU 18:11

## Deuteronomy 18:15 (id: 10245)

A prophet like me would be beyond the ordinary because Moses was without peer among the prophets (see [34:10–11](https://ref.ly/Deut34:10-Deut34:11)). This prophet would be from among your fellow Israelites (literally *from among your brothers*), and Israel was required to listen to him ([18:19](https://ref.ly/Deut18:19)). The prophets of Old Testament Israel would partially fulfill the function of God’s spokesman to whom Israel must listen. Later, Judaism looked for this prophet as a major messianic figure (see [John 1:21](https://ref.ly/John1:21); [6:14](https://ref.ly/John6:14); [7:40](https://ref.ly/John7:40)); the New Testament identifies Jesus as this prophet ([Acts 3:18–26](https://ref.ly/Acts3:18-Acts3:26)).

## Deuteronomy 19:1–13 (id: 10253)

Cities of refuge ([19:2](https://ref.ly/Deut19:2)) were strategically located throughout the land so those accused of homicide could find protective sanctuary until their cases came to trial (see [4:41](https://ref.ly/Deut4:41); [Num 35:6–29](https://ref.ly/Num35:6-Num35:29)).

## Deuteronomy 19:6 (id: 10260)

avenger (literally *the redeemer of blood*): The law allowed murder to be avenged by members of the victim’s family. When they found the killer, they could put him to death ([Num 35:16–21](https://ref.ly/Num35:16-Num35:21)). The idea was that blood shed by the victim must be paid for by the blood of the person responsible for the act (see [Gen 4:15](https://ref.ly/Gen4:15); [9:6](https://ref.ly/Gen9:6)). In this way, the land polluted by the shed blood could be purified ([Num 35:33–34](https://ref.ly/Num35:33-Num35:34)).

Purge (literally *burn*): The only way for the land to be free of culpability in matters of homicide was for blood vengeance to be enacted, which would burn out the impurity. See also [13:5](https://ref.ly/Deut13:5); [17:12](https://ref.ly/Deut17:12).

## Deuteronomy 19:21 (id: 10257)

The legal principle described as life for life is known as *lex talionis* (“law of retaliation”), according to which the punishment must fit the crime (see [Exod 21:23](https://ref.ly/Exod21:23); [Lev 24:20](https://ref.ly/Lev24:20)); it should be neither too lenient nor too severe. Appropriate punishment is a necessary function of government (cp. [Rom 13:1–7](https://ref.ly/Rom13:1-Rom13:7)), and it served to maintain Israel’s spiritual integrity as God’s people (see study note on Deut 17:7). But vengeance belongs to God, not individuals (see [1 Sam 25:26](https://ref.ly/1Sam25:26), [33](https://ref.ly/1Sam25:33); [Matt 5:38–39](https://ref.ly/Matt5:38-Matt5:39); [1 Cor 6:1–8](https://ref.ly/1Cor6:1-1Cor6:8)).

your neighbor’s vineyard: In a certain sense, God owned all the land and provided it to its human occupants. Therefore, no one had the right to make an exclusive claim to it. On the other hand, renters had rights to privacy and to a measure of control over what had been allotted to them. Trespassing was permitted within this context but not with the intention of theft. One could, however, pluck a few grapes or kernels of grain to eat along the way (see [Matt 12:1–8](https://ref.ly/Matt12:1-Matt12:8); [Mark 2:23–28](https://ref.ly/Mark2:23-Mark2:28); [Luke 6:1–5](https://ref.ly/Luke6:1-Luke6:5)).

The term rendered duties of a brother\-in\-law refers to the levirate (Latin for *brother\-in\-law*) marriage custom.

Sodom . . . Gomorrah: These cities were the epitome of evil (see [Gen 18:16–19:38](https://ref.ly/Gen18:16-Gen19:38)).

will change his mind about: When speaking of God, the Old Testament frequently uses figurative language (see study note on 8:2). Human beings cannot understand God’s mind ([Isa 55:8](https://ref.ly/Isa55:8)), so God uses human language and gives himself human physical characteristics and feelings. Although the Bible frequently speaks of God’s eyes, arms, hands, and feet, he is invisible and has no body; these metaphors describe his activity. Similarly, when the Bible says that God fears ([Deut 32:27](https://ref.ly/Deut32:27)) or changes his mind, it expresses how God’s actions appear to humans.

When God makes an oath, he is not bound to some course of action in the event that he proves undependable. Rather, the statement emphasizes the reliability of God’s promises above and beyond his character alone (see [Num 14:21](https://ref.ly/Num14:21), [28](https://ref.ly/Num14:28); [Isa 49:18](https://ref.ly/Isa49:18); [Ezek 20:5–6](https://ref.ly/Ezek20:5-Ezek20:6)).

Ephraim is listed first because he received the blessing of the firstborn over Manasseh ([Gen 48:8–22](https://ref.ly/Gen48:8-Gen48:22)). Manasseh, the firstborn, would normally have received the double portion belonging to the firstborn (cp. [Deut 21:17](https://ref.ly/Deut21:17)), but Jacob gave it to Ephraim, Joseph’s younger son. Moses’ blessing reflects Jacob’s blessing by listing the tribe of Ephraim as numbering in multitudes (literally *tens of thousands*) and Manasseh in thousands. After the conquest and establishment of the nation, Ephraim became the dominant tribe of the north; later, after the kingdom was divided following Solomon’s death ([1 Kgs 12](https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:1-1Kgs12:33)), the name Ephraim was used interchangeably with Israel in speaking of the northern kingdom.

to the mountain: Issachar was allotted much of the plains of Jezreel or Esdraelon. Mount Tabor, a prominent landmark of this region, was probably the mountain in view because later tradition knows this as a place of worship ([Hos 5:1](https://ref.ly/Hos5:1)). The nature of that worship is unclear, but it was probably proper even though it was not carried out at the Temple (see [1 Kgs 18:30](https://ref.ly/1Kgs18:30), [32](https://ref.ly/1Kgs18:32)). • The phrase riches of the sea might refer to the maritime industry of the people of Zebulun when their western border extended to the Mediterranean Sea (see [Gen 49:13](https://ref.ly/Gen49:13)).

Gad was the elder of two sons of Jacob by Leah’s servant Zilpah ([Gen 30:10–11](https://ref.ly/Gen30:10-Gen30:11)).

the best land: Gad chose this territory prior to the conquest. It was the famously rich and productive land of Bashan ([Num 32:1–5](https://ref.ly/Num32:1-Num32:5)). The commendation of Gad for carrying out the Lord’s justice and obeying his regulations probably refers to the tribe’s faithfulness in assisting the western tribes in their conquest of Canaan ([Josh 22:1–3](https://ref.ly/Josh22:1-Josh22:3)).

## Deuteronomy 33:22 (id: 10495)

Dan was the elder of two sons of Jacob by Rachel’s servant Bilhah ([Gen 30:5–6](https://ref.ly/Gen30:5-Gen30:6)). The name means “he judged.” The tribe of Dan was originally given territory between Judah and the Mediterranean. However, because of fierce hostility in that region, they were unable to settle there ([Josh 19:40–48](https://ref.ly/Josh19:40-Josh19:48)). The tribe then moved to the far north, destroyed the people who lived there, and settled in their place near Mount Hermon, north of the Sea of Galilee and adjacent to Bashan. The historical record doesn’t mention Dan’s staging area from which an attack was made against Laish, but the phrase leaping out from Bashan might suggest that Dan would attack from Bashan ([Judg 18:27–28](https://ref.ly/Judg18:27-Judg18:28); see [Gen 49:16–17](https://ref.ly/Gen49:16-Gen49:17)).

Asher was the younger of two sons of Jacob by Leah’s servant Zilpah ([Gen 30:12–13](https://ref.ly/Gen30:12-Gen30:13)). The name means “happy” or “blessed,” evident in the abundance of olive oil from the orchards that cover the lower Galilean hills and Mount Carmel, as well as the security from danger that these hills and other natural formations provided ([Deut 33:25](https://ref.ly/Deut33:25)).
