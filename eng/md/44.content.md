## Acts 1:1–3 (id: 9275)

Here Luke summarizes his first book, the Gospel of Luke, which Luke had previously written to Theophilus ([Luke 1:3](https://ref.ly/Luke1:3)). Theophilus is elsewhere called “most honorable” ([Luke 1:3](https://ref.ly/Luke1:3))—the title indicates that he was a person of very high social standing (cp. [Acts 23:26](https://ref.ly/Acts23:26); [24:2](https://ref.ly/Acts24:2); [26:25](https://ref.ly/Acts26:25)). He was probably a benefactor or patron who assisted Luke with the expenses of publication or distribution of his work (see study note on Luke 1:3).

## Acts 1:3 (id: 9287)

he proved to them in many ways that he was actually alive: The Gospels describe the evidence for Christ’s resurrection: Jesus’ tomb was empty ([Luke 24:3–4](https://ref.ly/Luke24:3-Luke24:4)), his grave clothes were undisturbed ([John 20:3–9](https://ref.ly/John20:3-John20:9)), and many people saw him (see [Matt 28](https://ref.ly/Matt28:1-Matt28:20); [Mark 16:1–8](https://ref.ly/Mark16:1-Mark16:8); [Luke 24:1–53](https://ref.ly/Luke24:1-Luke24:53); [John 20:11–21:23](https://ref.ly/John20:11-John21:23); [1 Cor 15:3–8](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:3-1Cor15:8)). Jesus appeared to the apostles in part to overcome their doubt ([Matt 28:17](https://ref.ly/Matt28:17); [Luke 24:17–24](https://ref.ly/Luke24:17-Luke24:24), [38](https://ref.ly/Luke24:38), [41](https://ref.ly/Luke24:41); [John 20:27](https://ref.ly/John20:27); see [Mark 16:14](https://ref.ly/Mark16:14)) • The Kingdom of God was the central theme of Jesus’ teaching (see[Acts 1:6–8](https://ref.ly/Acts1:6-Acts1:8); [Matt 4:17](https://ref.ly/Matt4:17); [Mark 1:14–15](https://ref.ly/Mark1:14-Mark1:15); [Luke 4:43](https://ref.ly/Luke4:43)).

## Acts 1:6–11 (id: 9290)

Jesus’ ascent into heaven (see also [Luke 24:50–53](https://ref.ly/Luke24:50-Luke24:53)) took place on the Mount of Olives ([Acts 1:12](https://ref.ly/Acts1:12); [Luke 24:50](https://ref.ly/Luke24:50)). It was Jesus’ last physical appearance—he was taken into heaven, where he will remain “until the time for the final restoration of all things” ([Acts 3:21](https://ref.ly/Acts3:21)).

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 1:6–ACT 1:11

## Acts 1:8 (id: 9291)

This key verse outlines the geographical extension of the Good News from its Jewish starting point in Jerusalem and Judea ([1:6–8:1](https://ref.ly/Acts1:6-Acts8:1)), out to Samaria ([8:4–25](https://ref.ly/Acts8:4-Acts8:25)), Antioch in Syria ([11:19–30](https://ref.ly/Acts11:19-Acts11:30)), and eventually throughout the Mediterranean world to Rome ([13:1–28:31](https://ref.ly/Acts13:1-Acts28:31)). Christ later gave a similar call to be his witnesses . . . to the ends of the earth to Saul of Tarsus ([9:15](https://ref.ly/Acts9:15)), who had persecuted the Jewish Christians and then became the primary instrument for taking the Good News to the Gentiles. • The Holy Spirit was the source of power for all this evangelistic and missionary effort.

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 1:8

## Acts 1:10 (id: 9276)

Christ’s rising into heaven indicates his elevation to a place of ultimate authority (see [Eph 1:19–23](https://ref.ly/Eph1:19-Eph1:23); [Phil 2:9–11](https://ref.ly/Phil2:9-Phil2:11)).

## Acts 1:11 (id: 9277)

Jesus promised to return from heaven in the same way (see [Matt 24:30](https://ref.ly/Matt24:30); [Mark 13:26](https://ref.ly/Mark13:26); [John 14:3](https://ref.ly/John14:3)). Jesus has gone to heaven to prepare the place for his followers ([John 12:26](https://ref.ly/John12:26); [14:1–4](https://ref.ly/John14:1-John14:4); [2 Cor 5:4](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:4); [Phil 3:21](https://ref.ly/Phil3:21); [Heb 6:20](https://ref.ly/Heb6:20)).

## Acts 1:13 (id: 9280)

All eleven of the remaining apostles were present (cp. [Matt 10:2–4](https://ref.ly/Matt10:2-Matt10:4); [Mark 3:16–19](https://ref.ly/Mark3:16-Mark3:19); [Luke 6:13–16](https://ref.ly/Luke6:13-Luke6:16)). Judas Iscariot is omitted from this list on account of his betrayal and death ([Acts 1:18–19](https://ref.ly/Acts1:18-Acts1:19)).

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 1:13

## Acts 1:13–26 (id: 9279)

While the apostles waited for the promised gift of the Holy Spirit ([1:4–5](https://ref.ly/Acts1:4-Acts1:5)), the whole company of 120 disciples in Jerusalem engaged in earnest prayer ([1:13–14](https://ref.ly/Acts1:13-Acts1:14)) and then appointed an apostle to replace Judas Iscariot ([1:15–26](https://ref.ly/Acts1:15-Acts1:26)).

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 1:13–ACT 1:26

## Acts 1:14 (id: 9281)

The first disciples were united in worship, fellowship, and prayer (see also [2:42](https://ref.ly/Acts2:42), [46–47](https://ref.ly/Acts2:46-Acts2:47); [4:24–31](https://ref.ly/Acts4:24-Acts4:31); [5:12](https://ref.ly/Acts5:12); [12:5](https://ref.ly/Acts12:5); [13:1–3](https://ref.ly/Acts13:1-Acts13:3)). The faithful women who had been witnesses of Jesus’ crucifixion and resurrection were present ([Luke 23:49](https://ref.ly/Luke23:49), [54–56](https://ref.ly/Luke23:54-Luke23:56); [24:1–10](https://ref.ly/Luke24:1-Luke24:10), [22](https://ref.ly/Luke24:22)). • The brothers of Jesus had not believed in him during his ministry ([John 7:3–5](https://ref.ly/John7:3-John7:5); cp. [Matt 12:46–49](https://ref.ly/Matt12:46-Matt12:49)), but became his disciples after his resurrection.

## Acts 1:18–19 (id: 9283)

Matthew’s account ([Matt 27:3–10](https://ref.ly/Matt27:3-Matt27:10)) is somewhat different; the two can be harmonized by considering the priests’ purchase of the “Field of Blood” as acting in Judas’s name. In addition, Judas may have committed suicide by hanging, but he subsequently fell headfirst and his body split open*,* perhaps when the rope broke.

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 1:18–ACT 1:19

## Acts 1:20–21 (id: 9284)

‘Let someone else take his position’: It was imperative that a replacement be found for Judas so that his position as the twelfth apostle would not remain empty. The new people of God, like Israel, were to have twelve designated and appointed leaders (see [Matt 19:28](https://ref.ly/Matt19:28); [Luke 22:29–30](https://ref.ly/Luke22:29-Luke22:30)).

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 1:20–ACT 1:21

## Acts 1:21–22 (id: 9285)

To qualify for nomination as an apostle, a man had to have been with the other apostles the entire time of Jesus’ public ministry, from the time he was baptized by John until his ascension.

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 1:21–ACT 1:22

## Acts 1:23–26 (id: 9286)

With prayer ([1:14](https://ref.ly/Acts1:14), [24](https://ref.ly/Acts1:24)) and humble dependence on God to reveal his will, the apostles cast lots*,* using an established method of finding God’s will (see [Lev 16:8](https://ref.ly/Lev16:8); [Num 27:21](https://ref.ly/Num27:21); [Deut 33:8](https://ref.ly/Deut33:8); [Josh 14:2](https://ref.ly/Josh14:2); [18:3–10](https://ref.ly/Josh18:3-Josh18:10); [Prov 16:33](https://ref.ly/Prov16:33)). Matthias was selected to replace Judas. After Pentecost, the Holy Spirit guided Jesus’ followers through dreams, visions, and prophecies instead of through lots (cp. [Acts 2:17–18](https://ref.ly/Acts2:17-Acts2:18); [13:2](https://ref.ly/Acts13:2); [16:7–10](https://ref.ly/Acts16:7-Acts16:10)). • you know every heart: See also [1 Sam 16:6–7](https://ref.ly/1Sam16:6-1Sam16:7); [1 Kgs 8:39](https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:39); [1 Chr 28:9](https://ref.ly/1Chr28:9); [2 Chr 6:30](https://ref.ly/2Chr6:30); [Pss 7:9](https://ref.ly/Ps7:9); [44:21](https://ref.ly/Ps44:21); [Jer 11:20](https://ref.ly/Jer11:20); [John 2:24–25](https://ref.ly/John2:24-John2:25); [Rev 2:23](https://ref.ly/Rev2:23).

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 1:23–ACT 1:26

## Acts 2:1–4 (id: 9449)

Jews observed three great annual pilgrimage festivals, when many would go to the Temple in Jerusalem—Unleavened Bread (which includes Passover), Pentecost (Harvest), and Shelters (see [Lev 23:1–44](https://ref.ly/Lev23:1-Lev23:44)). On Pentecost, when the Jewish people were gathered in Jerusalem to celebrate the harvest of God’s blessings, and when the disciples were united and expectant as they gathered for prayer, the Holy Spirit came and filled the gathered believers.

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 2:1–ACT 2:4

## Acts 2:4 (id: 9460)

everyone present was filled with the Holy Spirit: This event marks the coming of the Holy Spirit to fill Jesus’ disciples, as he had promised, so that they could be powerful witnesses ([1:4–5](https://ref.ly/Acts1:4-Acts1:5), [8](https://ref.ly/Acts1:8)). The Spirit’s wisdom, energy, and power were the driving force behind the church’s work and witness (e.g., [2:14–41](https://ref.ly/Acts2:14-Acts2:41), [43](https://ref.ly/Acts2:43); [4:31](https://ref.ly/Acts4:31); [9:17](https://ref.ly/Acts9:17), [20](https://ref.ly/Acts9:20); [13:9–12](https://ref.ly/Acts13:9-Acts13:12); see also [Eph 5:18](https://ref.ly/Eph5:18)). • began speaking in other languages: The Holy Spirit gave extraordinary communication that made it possible for people from other countries to hear in their own languages about what God had done ([Acts 2:6–11](https://ref.ly/Acts2:6-Acts2:11)). This passage is one of several references to speaking in “other languages” or “tongues” (see also [10:44–48](https://ref.ly/Acts10:44-Acts10:48); [19:6](https://ref.ly/Acts19:6); [1 Cor 14:2–28](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:2-1Cor14:28), [39](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:39)). Here, this supernatural gift reveals the energizing presence of God’s Spirit and inaugurates the proclamation of the Good News to people of every nation.

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 2:4

## Acts 2:5–11 (id: 9461)

Because Pentecost was a pilgrimage festival (see study note on 2:1–4), Jews from every nation were present in Jerusalem at that time and were thus able to hear the Good News being proclaimed in their own languages. The Good News is for all people ([2:38–39](https://ref.ly/Acts2:38-Acts2:39)).

## Acts 2:9–11 (id: 9462)

Parthians came from the region stretching from the Tigris River eastward to India. Medes (now called Kurds) were from Media, east of Mesopotamia and north of the Persian Gulf. Elamites were from Elam (now in Iran), north of the Persian Gulf and just east of the Tigris River. Mesopotamia lay between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Judea was well known as the Jewish homeland. Cappadocia, Pontus, and Asia were Roman provinces in Asia Minor (now in Turkey; see [1 Pet 1:1](https://ref.ly/1Pet1:1)); Paul later taught and preached in some of these areas (see [Acts 16:6](https://ref.ly/Acts16:6); [19:10](https://ref.ly/Acts19:10), [26](https://ref.ly/Acts19:26)). Phrygia and Pamphylia were districts of Asia Minor later visited by Paul ([13:13](https://ref.ly/Acts13:13); [18:23](https://ref.ly/Acts18:23)). Egypt had a large Jewish population, particularly in the city of Alexandria (see [18:24](https://ref.ly/Acts18:24)). North Africa was also represented by Libya and Cyrene. Rome was the imperial capital and the home of thousands of Jews. The Cretans came from the island of Crete, located south\-southeast of Greece, and the Arabs from the area south and east of Jerusalem. • The inclusion of all of these nations suggests how the Good News was going to go out to the ends of the earth ([1:8](https://ref.ly/Acts1:8)).

## Acts 2:14–36 (id: 9451)

This is the first of about thirty speeches in Acts and one of the most important, standing as it does at the very inception of the church. It is a typical example of the preaching of the apostles, who proclaimed (1\) that the Old Testament promises had been fulfilled in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, who is the promised Messiah; (2\) that the apostles themselves were eyewitnesses of Jesus’ entire public ministry and were his chosen representatives; (3\) that people are called to repent of their sins and have faith in God through Christ; and (4\) that salvation and the presence of the Holy Spirit are promised to those who respond affirmatively to this message of Good News. This basic message is echoed in the sermons of chs [3](https://ref.ly/Acts3:1-Acts3:26), [4](https://ref.ly/Acts4:1-Acts4:37), [5](https://ref.ly/Acts5:1-Acts5:42), [8](https://ref.ly/Acts8:1-Acts8:40), [10](https://ref.ly/Acts10:1-Acts10:48), [and 13](https://ref.ly/Acts13:1-Acts13:52). The same themes characterized Paul’s preaching (see [1 Cor 15:3–9](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:3-1Cor15:9)). This message was repeatedly preached to both Jews and Gentiles throughout the Mediterranean world; all people are summoned to repent of their sins and turn to God through faith in Jesus Christ.

## Acts 2:17–21 (id: 9452)

This passage quotes [Joel 2:28–32](https://ref.ly/Joel2:28-Joel2:32). The prophet Joel predicted a wider exercise of the gifts of prophecy, including visions and dreams by both young and old, both men and women in the last days ([Joel 2:28–29](https://ref.ly/Joel2:28-Joel2:29)). In Acts, on the day of Pentecost, Peter declared that Joel’s prophecy was being fulfilled, signaling that “the last days” had arrived.

While cruel men had crucified Jesus, this action had not defeated God’s prearranged plan for salvation. In fact, God raised him back to life*,* which David had foretold ([2:25–28](https://ref.ly/Acts2:25-Acts2:28)).

## Acts 2:32–36 (id: 9455)

God raised Jesus from the dead, and we are all witnesses of this: The witness theme is often repeated in Acts (e.g., [3:15](https://ref.ly/Acts3:15); [4:33](https://ref.ly/Acts4:33); [5:32](https://ref.ly/Acts5:32); [10:39–43](https://ref.ly/Acts10:39-Acts10:43)). The capstone of this message is that God the Father, as he had promised*,* was now pouring out his Holy Spirit on the church through the risen Jesus. All Israel was called upon to recognize that God had acted decisively to make the crucified Jesus both Lord and Messiah!

## Acts 2:42–47 (id: 9458)

Luke makes a clear connection between personal faith and membership in the Christian community. Life in this new community involved devotion to the apostolic teaching of God’s Word, fellowship, sharing*,* joy, and praise, and it resulted in the Lord’s continuing to add to their number those who were being saved.

## Acts 3:1–11 (id: 9590)

Jesus’ promise that his disciples would do even greater works than he had done ([John 14:12](https://ref.ly/John14:12); see [Mark 16:20](https://ref.ly/Mark16:20)) was fulfilled in the signs, wonders, and mighty works of the apostles ([Acts 2:43](https://ref.ly/Acts2:43); [5:12](https://ref.ly/Acts5:12); [8:4–8](https://ref.ly/Acts8:4-Acts8:8)). Here, Peter clearly exercised the power to heal in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene ([3:6](https://ref.ly/Acts3:6), [16](https://ref.ly/Acts3:16)). The cure was instant and undeniable ([3:8](https://ref.ly/Acts3:8)), resulting in the man’s praising God ([3:8–9](https://ref.ly/Acts3:8-Acts3:9); cp. [2:47](https://ref.ly/Acts2:47); [16:25](https://ref.ly/Acts16:25); [Luke 2:20](https://ref.ly/Luke2:20); [17:15–18](https://ref.ly/Luke17:15-Luke17:18); [18:43](https://ref.ly/Luke18:43); [19:37](https://ref.ly/Luke19:37); [24:53](https://ref.ly/Luke24:53)). This is the first of many demonstrations of divine power given to disciples in Acts ([Acts 4:24–31](https://ref.ly/Acts4:24-Acts4:31); [5:12](https://ref.ly/Acts5:12); [6:8](https://ref.ly/Acts6:8); [8:6](https://ref.ly/Acts8:6); [9:33–42](https://ref.ly/Acts9:33-Acts9:42); [28:8](https://ref.ly/Acts28:8)).

The Beautiful Gate was probably the Nicanor Gate, built of Corinthian bronze and located on the east side of the Temple (see Josephus, *War* 5\.5\.3\). It was adorned in a costly manner, with plates of silver and gold upon its panels richer and thicker than other gates. • Solomon’s Colonnade was a portico on the east side of the Temple (see Josephus, *War* 5\.5\.1–3; *Antiquities* 20\.9\.7\).

## Acts 3:12–26 (id: 9592)

The evangelistic speeches in the book of Acts focus on Jesus*,* the crucified and risen Lord. They call people to repentance and faith in Jesus as the promised Messiah and the divinely appointed Judge ([2:38](https://ref.ly/Acts2:38); [3:19](https://ref.ly/Acts3:19); [11:18](https://ref.ly/Acts11:18); [17:30](https://ref.ly/Acts17:30); [26:20](https://ref.ly/Acts26:20)). They also offer the same Good News for the people of Israel and the Gentile world—“there is peace with God through Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all” ([10:36](https://ref.ly/Acts10:36)).

## Acts 3:15 (id: 9593)

It was unfathomable to the Jewish mind that the author of life*,* God himself, could be killed. They did not recognize Jesus as Messiah (cp. [13:27](https://ref.ly/Acts13:27); [Luke 23:34](https://ref.ly/Luke23:34)), and they did not realize that the Messiah would be divine (see [John 1:1–18](https://ref.ly/John1:1-John1:18); cp.

## Acts 4:1–22 (id: 9601)

Persecution was a common experience of God’s people throughout the Bible. God’s servants often faced hostility and opposition ([Deut 30:7](https://ref.ly/Deut30:7); [1 Kgs 18:13](https://ref.ly/1Kgs18:13); [Neh 4:1–3](https://ref.ly/Neh4:1-Neh4:3); [Jer 37–38](https://ref.ly/Jer37:1-Jer38:28); [Matt 23:34–37](https://ref.ly/Matt23:34-Matt23:37); [Luke 11:49–51](https://ref.ly/Luke11:49-Luke11:51); [1 Thes 2:14–15](https://ref.ly/1Thess2:14-1Thess2:15)). Jesus himself was persecuted ([Luke 4:29](https://ref.ly/Luke4:29); [John 5:16](https://ref.ly/John5:16)), and he told his disciples to expect the same kind of treatment ([Matt 10:23](https://ref.ly/Matt10:23); [24:9](https://ref.ly/Matt24:9); [Mark 13:9](https://ref.ly/Mark13:9); [Luke 21:12](https://ref.ly/Luke21:12); [John 16:2](https://ref.ly/John16:2)), but he promised that the Holy Spirit would provide strength ([Acts 1:8](https://ref.ly/Acts1:8); [Luke 12:11–12](https://ref.ly/Luke12:11-Luke12:12); [21:15](https://ref.ly/Luke21:15)). Acts records frequent times of persecution ([Acts 4:3](https://ref.ly/Acts4:3); [5:17–41](https://ref.ly/Acts5:17-Acts5:41); [7:54–8:3](https://ref.ly/Acts7:54-Acts8:3); [9:1–2](https://ref.ly/Acts9:1-Acts9:2); [11:19](https://ref.ly/Acts11:19); [12:2](https://ref.ly/Acts12:2); [13:50](https://ref.ly/Acts13:50); [14:19](https://ref.ly/Acts14:19); [16:19–24](https://ref.ly/Acts16:19-Acts16:24)), but Acts also reiterates that the Holy Spirit empowers disciples to bear witness in such circumstances ([2:44](https://ref.ly/Acts2:44); [4:8–13](https://ref.ly/Acts4:8-Acts4:13); [6:10](https://ref.ly/Acts6:10); [7:55](https://ref.ly/Acts7:55)).

## Acts 4:23–31 (id: 9606)

The believers heard the report that their leaders had been threatened and commanded never again to speak about Jesus ([4:18](https://ref.ly/Acts4:18)). The Christian movement was clearly under attack from the religious authorities, so they united in prayer. They turned to God, placing their troubles before him and asking him to make them bold in speaking the message and to divinely confirm its truth with signs and wonders. God dramatically answered their request.

God’s hand had been directing events all along in order to achieve his purpose. A similar awareness of God’s hand guiding the affairs of his people is found in the Old Testament (cp.

The sharing of early believers was remarkable (see also [2:44–45](https://ref.ly/Acts2:44-Acts2:45); cp. [6:1](https://ref.ly/Acts6:1)). Being united in heart and mind*,* they willingly offered anything they possessed to meet the needs of other believers. This sharing was voluntary and without coercion, and it related to pressing needs in the community and was prompted by Christian love and concern for one another.

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 4:36–ACT 4:37

## Acts 5:1–11 (id: 9613)

Luke is fond of balancing a positive example with a negative example. He has just recorded the remarkable story of Barnabas ([4:36–37](https://ref.ly/Acts4:36-Acts4:37)). Now Luke presents the opposite conduct of Ananias and Sapphira*,* who were tempted by the desire to be held in high regard. Ananias had not been forced to sell his property or to give the proceeds away. The couple’s sin was in their pretense and deception.

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 5:1–ACT 5:11

## Acts 5:3–4 (id: 9620)

In lying about their property sale, Ananias was not just lying to others but to the Holy Spirit—that is, to God. His actions compromised the transparent sincerity, unity, and integrity of the church at its very foundation, and thus he fell under the direct judgment of God (cp. [Lev 10:1–5](https://ref.ly/Lev10:1-Lev10:5); [Josh 7:16–26](https://ref.ly/Josh7:16-Josh7:26)).

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 5:3–ACT 5:4

## Acts 5:11 (id: 9614)

Great fear gripped the entire church and everyone else who heard what had happened: The sudden judgment on Ananias and then on Sapphira had a sobering effect on both the Christian community and those who heard about this incident (cp. [Heb 10:31](https://ref.ly/Heb10:31)). Believers were forcefully reminded that they needed to be pure, and for non\-Christians the believers’ integrity was reestablished, so that once again “all the people had high regard for them” ([Acts 5:13](https://ref.ly/Acts5:13)). Yet it also made outsiders wary of joining a movement with such high standards ([5:13](https://ref.ly/Acts5:13)). This divine “pruning” (see [John 15:1–11](https://ref.ly/John15:1-John15:11)) helped new growth to follow ([Acts 5:14](https://ref.ly/Acts5:14); cp. [6:5–7](https://ref.ly/Acts6:5-Acts6:7); [11:24](https://ref.ly/Acts11:24); [21:20](https://ref.ly/Acts21:20)).

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 5:11

## Acts 5:12–16 (id: 9615)

As in Jesus’ ministry, the apostles’ preaching was accompanied by many miraculous signs and wonders*,* including convincing works of healing and exorcism (see also [6:8](https://ref.ly/Acts6:8); cp. [Matt 4:24](https://ref.ly/Matt4:24); [9:35](https://ref.ly/Matt9:35); [Mark 1:32–34](https://ref.ly/Mark1:32-Mark1:34); [Luke 4:40–41](https://ref.ly/Luke4:40-Luke4:41)).

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 5:12–ACT 5:16

## Acts 5:13 (id: 9616)

no one else dared to join them: Perhaps the high standards of belief or what had happened to Ananias and Sapphira ([5:11](https://ref.ly/Acts5:11)) were daunting to the crowds. • though all the people had high regard for them: Christians were markedly different from the unbelievers around them.

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 5:13

## Acts 5:17–40 (id: 9617)

The success of the apostles’ ministry again aroused strong opposition (cp. [4:1–3](https://ref.ly/Acts4:1-Acts4:3)). The wealthy and powerful Sadducees controlled the Temple establishment and had a Temple police force at their disposal. They opposed belief in the resurrection and were determined not to allow the apostles to proclaim their message about the resurrection of Jesus unchallenged. They also sensed that their hold on the Jewish people was loosening, so, filled with jealousy*,* they attacked the apostles.

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 5:17–ACT 5:40

## Acts 5:19–20 (id: 9618)

The irony here is that the Sadducees denied the existence of angels ([23:8](https://ref.ly/Acts23:8)). Angels frequently intervened in Acts (see also [10:3](https://ref.ly/Acts10:3), [7](https://ref.ly/Acts10:7), [22](https://ref.ly/Acts10:22); [11:13](https://ref.ly/Acts11:13); [12:6–11](https://ref.ly/Acts12:6-Acts12:11), [23](https://ref.ly/Acts12:23); [27:23–24](https://ref.ly/Acts27:23-Acts27:24)).

This Theudas is otherwise unknown, although Josephus mentions a different man by that name who raised a revolt some years later (see Josephus, *Antiquities* 20\.5\.1\). Theudas was a common Jewish name. • Judas of Galilee appears in Josephus as a rebel who opposed giving tribute to Caesar about AD 6 or 7, following the census of Quirinius (see Josephus, *Antiquities* 20\.5\.2; cp.

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 6:1

## Acts 6:2–6 (id: 9627)

Wisely, the apostles called a meeting of all the believers to address the dispute. They recognized the seriousness of the problem, as well as their own priority of teaching the word of God. The solution was to select wise and Spirit\-filled men to oversee the food distribution. The community accepted the apostles’ solution and chose good leaders from the ranks of the Greek\-speaking believers (all of their names are Greek). These seven devoted themselves to this special ministry, allowing the apostles to spend their time in prayer and teaching the word. • These seven men are sometimes called the first deacons because of the similarity of their role to the office of deacon (see [1 Tim 3:8–13](https://ref.ly/1Tim3:8-1Tim3:13)). Although the Greek term translated “deacon” (Greek diakonos, “servant”) is not used here, a related Greek word is translated running a food program ([6:2](https://ref.ly/Acts6:2); Greek diakonein*,* “to serve”).

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 6:2–ACT 6:6

## Acts 6:7 (id: 9628)

The result of the apostles’ wise handling of the issue was growth and increase in the number of believers*,* including many of the Jewish priests. • This is the first of three places in Acts where Luke notes that God’s message continued to spread (see also [12:24](https://ref.ly/Acts12:24); [19:20](https://ref.ly/Acts19:20)). When real difficulties arose, God’s message could overcome the challenges posed by internal strife, idolatry, and paganism, and the result was growth in the community. Acts is the story of the unhindered message of Good News (see [28:31](https://ref.ly/Acts28:31)).

Stephen responded to the accusations by testifying about his Lord (cp. [Luke 21:12–17](https://ref.ly/Luke21:12-Luke21:17)). Instead of defending himself against their prosecution, he became a witness in God’s prosecution of them, exposing their stubbornness and unfaithfulness to God. Stephen’s recital of Israel’s past reminded them of their repeated rejections of those whom God had sent. • Stephen’s review of Israel’s history has three principal parts, dealing with the work of the patriarchs ([Acts 7:2–16](https://ref.ly/Acts7:2-Acts7:16)), the ministry of Moses ([7:17–43](https://ref.ly/Acts7:17-Acts7:43)), and the role of the Tabernacle and the Temple ([7:44–50](https://ref.ly/Acts7:44-Acts7:50)). Stephen followed up his historical survey with a clear attack on the hard\-heartedness of his own people. With a prophetic challenge, he urged them to stop rebelling against the Holy Spirit and turn to God with repentance and faith.

Compare this figure with the *seventy* mentioned in the Hebrew text of [Gen 46:27](https://ref.ly/Gen46:27).

The Septuagint includes three descendants of Ephraim and two of Manasseh at [Gen 46:20](https://ref.ly/Gen46:20), making for a total of five more persons, whereas the Hebrew text does not include descendants for Joseph’s sons.

Molech was a Canaanite god to whom human sacrifices were offered ([Lev 18:21](https://ref.ly/Lev18:21); [20:2–5](https://ref.ly/Lev20:2-Lev20:5); [1 Kgs 11:7](https://ref.ly/1Kgs11:7); [2 Kgs 23:10](https://ref.ly/2Kgs23:10); [Jer 32:35](https://ref.ly/Jer32:35)).

One of the charges was that Stephen was speaking against the Temple (cp. [6:14](https://ref.ly/Acts6:14)). The leading priests and scribes controlled the Temple commerce and had a vital business interest in maintaining their enterprises unhindered (see [Luke 19:45–48](https://ref.ly/Luke19:45-Luke19:48)).

Jesus standing . . . at God’s right hand: Usually Jesus is described as *seated* in heaven at God’s right hand ([2:33–34](https://ref.ly/Acts2:33-Acts2:34); [5:31](https://ref.ly/Acts5:31); [Luke 20:42](https://ref.ly/Luke20:42); [22:69](https://ref.ly/Luke22:69); [Rom 8:34](https://ref.ly/Rom8:34); [Eph 1:20](https://ref.ly/Eph1:20); [Col 3:1](https://ref.ly/Col3:1); [Heb 1:3](https://ref.ly/Heb1:3), [13](https://ref.ly/Heb1:13); [10:12](https://ref.ly/Heb10:12)). One possible explanation is that Jesus was welcoming Stephen, the first martyr, to heaven with honor. Stephen had confessed his Lord faithfully on earth, and now his Lord honored his promise to confess his faithful servant in heaven, standing as a witness to defend him ([Matt 10:32](https://ref.ly/Matt10:32); [Luke 12:8](https://ref.ly/Luke12:8)). • the Son of Man standing: Cp. [Dan 7:13–14](https://ref.ly/Dan7:13-Dan7:14). The Jewish leaders understood that Stephen was speaking of Jesus as the divine Son of Man ([Acts 7:57](https://ref.ly/Acts7:57)), a title that speaks of Jesus’ power and authority (cp.

Stephen’s prayer, Lord, don’t charge them with this sin*,* is strikingly similar to Jesus’ prayer at his crucifixion ([Luke 23:34](https://ref.ly/Luke23:34)). Jesus clearly taught his followers the importance of both forgiveness ([Matt 6:14–15](https://ref.ly/Matt6:14-Matt6:15); [Mark 11:25](https://ref.ly/Mark11:25); see [Luke 11:4](https://ref.ly/Luke11:4); [17:3–4](https://ref.ly/Luke17:3-Luke17:4)) and prayer ([Luke 11:5–10](https://ref.ly/Luke11:5-Luke11:10); [18:1–8](https://ref.ly/Luke18:1-Luke18:8); see also [Acts 1:12–15](https://ref.ly/Acts1:12-Acts1:15); [4:23–31](https://ref.ly/Acts4:23-Acts4:31); [12:5](https://ref.ly/Acts12:5); [Jas 5:16–18](https://ref.ly/Jas5:16-Jas5:18)).

## Acts 8:9–24 (id: 9652)

Simon the sorcerer was a showman, dazzling the people of Samaria and making self\-exalting claims. Simon’s attempt to obtain spiritual power through payment gave the name *simony* to the later corrupt practice of buying and selling ordination to church leadership (cp. [1 Tim 6:9–10](https://ref.ly/1Tim6:9-1Tim6:10)). Peter strongly rebuked Simon’s wickedness.

When the apostles sent two of their own to Samaria*,* it was an amazing step in overcoming prejudice (cp.

Then, it was even more amazing that Peter and John prayed that the new Samaritan believers would receive the Holy Spirit. This event parallels the day of Pentecost in Jerusalem ([Acts 2:1–47](https://ref.ly/Acts2:1-Acts2:47)) and marks the spread of the Holy Spirit’s power from Judea to Samaria ([1:8](https://ref.ly/Acts1:8)).

Philip obeyed the Holy Spirit’s leading and then seized the opportunity to share the message of Good News with a eunuch on the desert road . . . from Jerusalem to Gaza.

## Acts 8:27 (id: 9647)

In the ancient world, a eunuch was an official, typically castrated, who served in a royal court (see [2 Kgs 9:30–32](https://ref.ly/2Kgs9:30-2Kgs9:32); [Esth 1:10](https://ref.ly/Esth1:10); [2:3](https://ref.ly/Esth2:3), [14–15](https://ref.ly/Esth2:14-Esth2:15), [21](https://ref.ly/Esth2:21); [4:4–5](https://ref.ly/Esth4:4-Esth4:5)). Eunuchs were often scorned by Jews because they could not perpetuate the covenant family, and the law of Moses excluded men who had damaged genitals from the assembly of Israel ([Deut 23:1](https://ref.ly/Deut23:1); cp. [Lev 21:17–23](https://ref.ly/Lev21:17-Lev21:23)), but Isaiah spoke of God’s acceptance of Gentiles and eunuchs ([Isa 56:3–8](https://ref.ly/Isa56:3-Isa56:8); see also [Matt 19:12](https://ref.ly/Matt19:12)). In the new covenant, all who have genuine faith have a place among the people of God. • The eunuch had traveled from Africa to Jerusalem to worship in the Temple, probably for one of the great Jewish festivals.

## Acts 9:1–19 (id: 9653)

The conversion of Saul of Tarsus on the Damascus road is of central importance to the narrative of Acts—Luke recounts the story three times (also [22:1–21](https://ref.ly/Acts22:1-Acts22:21); [26:1–29](https://ref.ly/Acts26:1-Acts26:29)). Paul (Saul) also alludes to this experience several times in his letters ([1 Cor 15:8–10](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:8-1Cor15:10); [Gal 1:11–17](https://ref.ly/Gal1:11-Gal1:17); [Phil 3:4–11](https://ref.ly/Phil3:4-Phil3:11); see [1 Tim 1:12–17](https://ref.ly/1Tim1:12-1Tim1:17)). Saul’s conversion was his prophetic call and commission as an apostle ([Acts 9:15](https://ref.ly/Acts9:15); [22:15](https://ref.ly/Acts22:15), [21](https://ref.ly/Acts22:21); [26:15–18](https://ref.ly/Acts26:15-Acts26:18)). No one is beyond the power of God to reach, redeem, and use for holy purposes—nothing is impossible with God ([Luke 1:37](https://ref.ly/Luke1:37)). Paul was prepared through his training, upbringing, and experience to play a unique role in taking the gospel into the broader world as the “apostle to the Gentiles” ([Rom 11:13](https://ref.ly/Rom11:13); see [1 Cor 15:9](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:9); [2 Cor 12:11–12](https://ref.ly/2Cor12:11-2Cor12:12); [Gal 1:1](https://ref.ly/Gal1:1); [Eph 3:8](https://ref.ly/Eph3:8)).

## Acts 9:2 (id: 9662)

The synagogues (Greek sunagōgē, “gathering place”) were local Jewish meeting places. After the Exile, Jews began to meet in local synagogues as places of instruction and centers of worship. Synagogue services consisted of the reading of the Law and the Prophets, exposition of the Scriptures, prayer, praise, and thanksgiving (see [13:15](https://ref.ly/Acts13:15); [15:21](https://ref.ly/Acts15:21); [Neh 9:5](https://ref.ly/Neh9:5); [Matt 6:5](https://ref.ly/Matt6:5); [Luke 4:16–21](https://ref.ly/Luke4:16-Luke4:21)). Jesus attended, taught, preached, and performed miracles in synagogues ([Matt 12:9–10](https://ref.ly/Matt12:9-Matt12:10); [Mark 1:21](https://ref.ly/Mark1:21), [39](https://ref.ly/Mark1:39); [Luke 4:16](https://ref.ly/Luke4:16); [13:10–13](https://ref.ly/Luke13:10-Luke13:13); [John 6:59](https://ref.ly/John6:59); [18:20](https://ref.ly/John18:20)), as did the apostles (see [Acts 9:20](https://ref.ly/Acts9:20); [13:5](https://ref.ly/Acts13:5), [14](https://ref.ly/Acts13:14); [14:1](https://ref.ly/Acts14:1); [17:1](https://ref.ly/Acts17:1), [10](https://ref.ly/Acts17:10), [17](https://ref.ly/Acts17:17); [18:4](https://ref.ly/Acts18:4), [19](https://ref.ly/Acts18:19), [26](https://ref.ly/Acts18:26)). • Damascus*,* the capital of Syria, was an important center with a long and distinguished past and the nearest major city outside of Palestine. It took from four to six days to reach Damascus from Jerusalem, a fact that highlights Saul’s earnestness ([9:1–5](https://ref.ly/Acts9:1-Acts9:5); see [22:4–8](https://ref.ly/Acts22:4-Acts22:8); [26:9–15](https://ref.ly/Acts26:9-Acts26:15)). • The expression the Way is used in Acts for Christianity (see [19:9](https://ref.ly/Acts19:9), [23](https://ref.ly/Acts19:23); [24:14](https://ref.ly/Acts24:14), [22](https://ref.ly/Acts24:22))—it is “the way of God” ([18:26](https://ref.ly/Acts18:26)) that tells people “how to be saved” ([16:17](https://ref.ly/Acts16:17), literally *the way of salvation*).

Saul of Tarsus (Paul) was God’s choice to spearhead this expansive missionary effort to bring the Christian message to the Gentiles and to kings, as well as to the people of Israel. The rest of Acts illustrates Saul’s (Paul’s) faithfulness in carrying out this divine commission (e.g., [26:19–23](https://ref.ly/Acts26:19-Acts26:23)).

Despite the bewilderment of his hearers, Saul so compellingly presented the evidence for the claims of Jesus as Messiah that the non\-believing Jews in Damascus found themselves unable to refute it. Apparently this went on for some time (see [Gal 1:18](https://ref.ly/Gal1:18)), so some of the non\-believing Jews launched a plot on his life, but he was spared when some believers let him down out of the city in a large basket.

Fortunately, Barnabas, the “Son of Encouragement” ([4:36](https://ref.ly/Acts4:36)), introduced the changed man to the apostles and explained his encounter with the Lord at Damascus*,* his sense of calling, and his subsequent boldness in preaching in the name of Jesus in Damascus. Barnabas was able to convince the apostles that Saul’s conversion was genuine, so Saul remained with the apostles in Jerusalem, where he preached boldly for his Lord.

## Acts 10:36–43 (id: 9298)

Peter repeatedly underscores the importance of the apostolic witnesses to the message of Good News. The apostles ate and drank with Jesus (see [Luke 24:41–43](https://ref.ly/Luke24:41-Luke24:43)) and were eyewitnesses of his resurrection, so they could attest that he had conquered death (see [Acts 3:15](https://ref.ly/Acts3:15); [4:33](https://ref.ly/Acts4:33); [13:30–31](https://ref.ly/Acts13:30-Acts13:31)). The original apostles were chosen in advance to be his witnesses (see [1:12–26](https://ref.ly/Acts1:12-Acts1:26)); gradually, others such as Paul and Barnabas carried on this powerful preaching and teaching in the name of Jesus Christ ([9:15](https://ref.ly/Acts9:15); [14:1–3](https://ref.ly/Acts14:1-Acts14:3); [26:16](https://ref.ly/Acts26:16)).

## Acts 10:43 (id: 9300)

Based on what they had seen and heard ([10:39–42](https://ref.ly/Acts10:39-Acts10:42)), the apostles could proclaim that Jesus of Nazareth was indeed the one all the prophets testified about. The whole plan of the Scriptures is profoundly centered in Christ (see [Luke 24:25–27](https://ref.ly/Luke24:25-Luke24:27), [44–47](https://ref.ly/Luke24:44-Luke24:47); [John 5:39](https://ref.ly/John5:39)). • The major point of their message was that everyone who believes in him will have their sins forgiven through his name (see [Luke 24:47](https://ref.ly/Luke24:47)).

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 10:43

## Acts 10:44–48 (id: 9301)

On the day of Pentecost, Peter told the assembly that if they would repent, turn to God, and be baptized in the name of Jesus for the forgiveness of sins, they would receive “the gift of the Holy Spirit” ([2:38](https://ref.ly/Acts2:38); cp. [19:1–7](https://ref.ly/Acts19:1-Acts19:7)). As Cornelius and his household listened to Peter’s message, the Holy Spirit fell upon them, too, and they were baptized. They received the Holy Spirit just as the Jews did, so clearly God had shown no partiality ([10:34–35](https://ref.ly/Acts10:34-Acts10:35)). This event parallels the day of Pentecost in Jerusalem ([2:1–47](https://ref.ly/Acts2:1-Acts2:47)) and marks the spread of the Holy Spirit’s power to Gentiles ([1:8](https://ref.ly/Acts1:8); [2:39](https://ref.ly/Acts2:39)).

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 10:44–ACT 10:48

Cornelius asked Peter to stay with them for several days*,* perhaps because of his need for instruction in the Christian way.

## Acts 11:1–18 (id: 9304)

Jews traditionally kept themselves separate and did not eat or associate socially with Gentiles ([10:28](https://ref.ly/Acts10:28); [22:21–22](https://ref.ly/Acts22:21-Acts22:22); see [John 4:9](https://ref.ly/John4:9), [27](https://ref.ly/John4:27); [18:28](https://ref.ly/John18:28); [Gal 2:12–14](https://ref.ly/Gal2:12-Gal2:14)). Therefore, when the Jewish believers in Jerusalem learned that Gentiles had received the word of God*,* they criticized Peter’s unconventional actions and wanted an explanation, which Peter provided.

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 11:1–ACT 11:18

## Acts 11:4–17 (id: 9315)

Peter reviewed the sequence of events, explaining that the whole development was the result of God’s initiative ([11:12](https://ref.ly/Acts11:12)). Peter had eaten with Gentiles because God had made it clear that he should ([11:4–12](https://ref.ly/Acts11:4-Acts11:12)). Peter had then observed the Holy Spirit’s definite action of coming upon Gentiles, and he realized that they were being accepted and blessed by God just as Jewish believers had been ([11:15–17](https://ref.ly/Acts11:15-Acts11:17); see [1:5](https://ref.ly/Acts1:5)). Peter was submitting to God’s will in admitting Gentiles to the church.

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 11:4–ACT 11:17

## Acts 11:18 (id: 9305)

Peter’s logical, straightforward explanation convinced those who had objected—they recognized God’s hand at work in the conversion of the Gentiles and their receiving eternal life. However, issues relating to the inclusion of Gentiles would soon provoke a major crisis ([15:1–35](https://ref.ly/Acts15:1-Acts15:35); Paul’s letter to the Galatians).

Once again, as had happened in the household of Cornelius, Gentiles turned to the Lord in considerable numbers. The explosion of Christian faith into the Gentile world had to remain in harmony with the church at Jerusalem, so the Jerusalem church sent Barnabas to Antioch to oversee developments there. He could see that God’s blessing was on what was happening, so he endorsed it with joy.

The upshot of Agabus’s prophecy was that the believers in Antioch decided to make a contribution to the Jewish believers—the brothers and sisters—in Judea. The believers in Antioch gave as generously as they could and committed the responsibility for this financial aid to leaders they trusted, namely, to Barnabas and his fellow worker Saul. This unified love and support of Christians for one another was a tangible demonstration of the difference Christ had made in their lives. Paul describes this visit in his letter to the Galatians ([Gal 2:1–10](https://ref.ly/Gal2:1-Gal2:10)).

## Acts 12:1–5 (id: 9316)

Jesus had clearly predicted persecution and hardship for his followers ([Luke 11:49–51](https://ref.ly/Luke11:49-Luke11:51)). For the first time since Jesus’ death, Roman authorities took direct violent action against the church. James*,* the brother of John, was one of the first called to be a disciple ([Mark 1:16–20](https://ref.ly/Mark1:16-Mark1:20); [Luke 5:1–11](https://ref.ly/Luke5:1-Luke5:11)), and he was one of the first Christians to be martyred for his faith. • King Herod Agrippa attacked the church (cp. [Acts 12:20–23](https://ref.ly/Acts12:20-Acts12:23)), a move that he found to be politically helpful with the Jewish people. The letter of James, the brother of Jesus, was probably written after this persecution to the scattered Christians (see [8:1–4](https://ref.ly/Acts8:1-Acts8:4); James Book Introduction, “Date of Writing”).

The prophets and teachers of the church at Antioch spent significant time in worship and prayer, earnestly seeking the Lord’s will as they fasted and opened themselves to divine direction. As they prayed, the Holy Spirit spoke to them, and they set apart Barnabas and Saul in clear recognition of God’s call for them to carry out a special work in his name.

[Acts 10:34–35](https://ref.ly/Acts10:34-Acts10:35)), in accord with the Lord’s command in Scripture.

Lycaonia was a southern region of the Roman province of Galatia. Its major cities were Lystra, Derbe, Laranda, and Iconium. Acts reports two more visits by Paul to Lycaonia ([16:1–5](https://ref.ly/Acts16:1-Acts16:5); [18:23](https://ref.ly/Acts18:23)). Paul’s letter to the Galatians was probably addressed to scattered believers in the churches of Lycaonia (see Galatians Book Introduction, “Recipients”). • Lystra was located roughly twenty\-five miles (40 km) south\-southwest of Iconium. • Derbe*,* situated about thirty miles (50 km) southeast of Lystra, was on the busy major road that stretched from Iconium and Lystra eastward to Tarsus, the capital of Cilicia.

Zeus was the patron god of Lystra, and the city had a temple in his honor. They associated Barnabas with Zeus, perhaps because he was the more impressive figure, and Hermes was identified with Paul . . . since he was the chief speaker. The native people of Lystra thought that they were being treated to a divine visitation similar to a past mythological appearance cited by the poet Ovid (in which the gods Zeus and Hermes came to visit the area but were unrecognized except by an old couple; see Ovid, *Metamorphoses* 8\.616–724\).

Paul and Silas were both Roman citizens*,* so the beating and imprisonment ([16:22–24](https://ref.ly/Acts16:22-Acts16:24)) had been illegal. After the city officials learned of this, they were justifiably alarmed because they had committed a crime against Rome. • Let them come themselves to release us: Paul made use of his rights as a Roman citizen in order to clear his name and ensure that no disrepute would attach to the Christian message or those who accepted it. Luke intended to show that Christianity should enjoy the same status as Judaism in the Roman Empire as a permitted religion—the Christian faith was compatible with the life of a Roman citizen. Accordingly, it was important to note that Paul made use of his rights as a Roman citizen (cp. [22:25–27](https://ref.ly/Acts22:25-Acts22:27)) and was ready to use the privileges of citizenship to advance the cause of Christ in a hostile world.

In this chapter, we see Paul presented as a model witness for Christ, engaging the thinkers of his day and challenging them with the Christian message. Paul quoted writers his audience would be familiar with and showed the relevance of the gospel by dialoguing with them, critiquing their assumptions, and offering Jesus as a constructive alternative (see [Col 1:28](https://ref.ly/Col1:28)). Paul reminded these proud intellectuals that there is a living God to whom all human beings are answerable; that they will be judged by him through Jesus, whom God raised from the dead; and that they should therefore repent and put their faith in Jesus.

## Acts 17:18 (id: 9409)

Epicurean . . . philosophers: Epicureanism was a popular school of Greek philosophy, founded by Epicurus (341–270 BC). Epicureans believed that the principal aim of life was to secure happiness. They thought of pleasure not in terms of sensual indulgence, as their critics charged, but in terms of tranquility. Their contemporaries often called them atheists; in their view, there were no gods to fear, and death simply marked the end of human existence. They sought their security in organized communities where they could live in contentment apart from society. • Stoic philosophers: Stoicism was founded by Zeno of Citium (335–263 BC) and became the most influential philosophy in the Greco\-Roman world. It viewed the universe as permeated by Reason (sometimes referred to as God or Providence). Stoicism saw divine Reason as expressed in human reason and held that as humans made progress, they could advance from ignorance (the source of vice) to true knowledge (the source of virtue). They developed extensive lists of virtues and vices and produced detailed household codes to guide family behavior. Paul’s teaching resembles that of the Stoics in his use of household codes and lists of virtues and vices ([Gal 5:19–23](https://ref.ly/Gal5:19-Gal5:23); [Eph 5:22–33](https://ref.ly/Eph5:22-Eph5:33); [Col 3:18–4:1](https://ref.ly/Col3:18-Col4:1); [1 Tim 3:1–13](https://ref.ly/1Tim3:1-1Tim3:13); [5:1–6:1](https://ref.ly/1Tim5:1-1Tim5:6)). However, Paul’s message of Good News—focusing on the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ—was strange and foreign to these Greek philosophers. • The air of superiority with which they addressed Paul as this babbler indicates their arrogance.

## Acts 17:22–31 (id: 9410)

Paul’s remarkable sermon in Athens reveals his versatility in preaching the Good News ([Rom 11:14](https://ref.ly/Rom11:14); [1 Cor 9:19–23](https://ref.ly/1Cor9:19-1Cor9:23); [10:33](https://ref.ly/1Cor10:33); cp. [Acts 16:3](https://ref.ly/Acts16:3); [17:2–3](https://ref.ly/Acts17:2-Acts17:3); [21:20–26](https://ref.ly/Acts21:20-Acts21:26)). While Paul’s Greek audience did not know the Scriptures or have a tradition of monotheism as the Jews did, they did have a rich intellectual heritage. So Paul established a point of contact on the basis of an Athenian inscription to an Unknown God. He then explained God’s nature as the Creator ([17:22–29](https://ref.ly/Acts17:22-Acts17:29)), followed by God’s purpose as the Redeemer ([17:30–31](https://ref.ly/Acts17:30-Acts17:31)). • As he did elsewhere in his own writings (see [1 Cor 15:33](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:33); [Titus 1:12](https://ref.ly/Titus1:12)), Paul made use of the Greek poets. There are several points of connection in this sermon with the *Hymn to Zeus* by Cleanthes (about 315–240 BC). Paul was probably quoting Epimenides, who had declared about God, “In him we live and move and exist” (Epimenides, *Cretica,* about 600 BC). Paul also cited Aratus, a Stoic poet from Cilicia (about 315–240 BC), who had commented, “We are his offspring” (Aratus, *Phaenomena* 5\). These allusions to their own poets established connections with his audience. Paul was then able to present the singular nature of God ([Acts 17:29](https://ref.ly/Acts17:29)), and he stressed the coming judgment through Jesus Christ, whom God had raised from the dead. This message, while touching on Greek culture and philosophy, had a clear focus on Christ that presented the challenge of Christ to a cultured and intellectual but idolatrous people.

## Acts 17:30 (id: 9411)

The idea of people’s ignorance is carefully discussed both in the Old Testament law ([Lev 4:2](https://ref.ly/Lev4:2), [22](https://ref.ly/Lev4:22), [27](https://ref.ly/Lev4:27); [5:15](https://ref.ly/Lev5:15), [17](https://ref.ly/Lev5:17); [Num 15:25](https://ref.ly/Num15:25), [27](https://ref.ly/Num15:27)) and in the New Testament ([Eph 4:18](https://ref.ly/Eph4:18); [1 Pet 1:14](https://ref.ly/1Pet1:14); [2:15](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:15); [2 Pet 3:5](https://ref.ly/2Pet3:5), [8](https://ref.ly/2Pet3:8)). Paul was particularly fervent about combatting ignorance (see [Rom 10:13–15](https://ref.ly/Rom10:13-Rom10:15); [11:25](https://ref.ly/Rom11:25); [1 Cor 10:1](https://ref.ly/1Cor10:1); [12:1](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:1); [2 Cor 1:8](https://ref.ly/2Cor1:8); [1 Thes 4:13](https://ref.ly/1Thess4:13)).

The Athenians listened carefully until Paul spoke of the resurrection of the dead ([17:31](https://ref.ly/Acts17:31)); at that point some laughed or mocked, for the notion of resurrection was foolish to Greek ears (see [1 Cor 15:12–19](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:12-1Cor15:19)). Similarly, the Jews in Jerusalem later listened carefully to Paul until he mentioned God’s acceptance of the Gentiles ([Acts 22:22](https://ref.ly/Acts22:22)). These are examples of how the message of Good News can offend people because of their prejudices (see [1 Cor 1:20–25](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:20-1Cor1:25)).

The patron deity of Ephesus was the Greek goddess Artemis. Her birthplace was believed to be Ephesus, so Ephesus was the official guardian of the temple. Twice annually, elaborate festivals were held in her honor with athletic, musical, and theatrical celebrations that included singing Great is Artemis of the Ephesians! The temple of Artemis at Ephesus was one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. Conversions to Christianity clearly damaged the worship of Artemis and the associated economic activity, but it became clear that Paul and his associates had committed no crime.

Paul’s premier defense of his life and faith before his own people in Jerusalem illustrates his flexibility as a missionary, just as his speech to the Greek philosophers in Athens had done ([17:22–31](https://ref.ly/Acts17:22-Acts17:31); see [1 Cor 9:20–23](https://ref.ly/1Cor9:20-1Cor9:23)).

Paul then describes his persecution of Christians ([22:4–5](https://ref.ly/Acts22:4-Acts22:5)), the revelation of Jesus to him on the way to Damascus ([22:6–10](https://ref.ly/Acts22:6-Acts22:10)), and his conversion ([22:11–16](https://ref.ly/Acts22:11-Acts22:16)).

Paul focused on the key issue in his trial, the hope of resurrection from the dead.

Pharisees could not abide the inclusion of the Gentiles apart from circumcision and keeping the law of Moses (cp. [15:5](https://ref.ly/Acts15:5)), but that was what the resurrection of Jesus and the outpouring of the Spirit had provided ([Acts 2:39](https://ref.ly/Acts2:39); [10:34–48](https://ref.ly/Acts10:34-Acts10:48)).

The letter of Claudius Lysias to Governor Felix is a typical Hellenistic letter, naming the writer and the person addressed, offering a greeting, and stating the business at hand (though there is no parting word of farewell; see study note on 15:29).

Drusilla was the sister of Herod Agrippa II and Bernice ([25:13](https://ref.ly/Acts25:13)); Drusilla had abandoned her former husband, Azizus the King of Emessa, and married Felix.

Paul’s hearing before King Agrippa was accompanied by all the pomp and circumstance appropriate for an official royal visit.

## Acts 26:1–23 (id: 9542)

In his eloquent defense before King Agrippa*,* Paul argued that his preaching was completely consistent with the Jewish faith. The defense begins with a courteous acknowledgement of Agrippa’s competence to hear the evidence ([26:2–3](https://ref.ly/Acts26:2-Acts26:3)), outlines the nature of Paul’s background, Jewish training, and membership in the Pharisees ([26:4–5](https://ref.ly/Acts26:4-Acts26:5)), and explains that the charges against him are merely for believing the fulfillment of Jewish hopes for the resurrection ([26:6–8](https://ref.ly/Acts26:6-Acts26:8)). Paul then tells the story of his conversion from strong opponent of Christianity ([26:9–11](https://ref.ly/Acts26:9-Acts26:11)) through a vision on the way to Damascus ([26:12–18](https://ref.ly/Acts26:12-Acts26:18); see [9:1–18](https://ref.ly/Acts9:1-Acts9:18)). His preaching was nothing more than obeying this divine vision ([26:19–20](https://ref.ly/Acts26:19-Acts26:20)). Even though he encountered violent opposition from his fellow Jews ([26:21](https://ref.ly/Acts26:21)), God protected him as he taught a message that the Jews should have embraced ([26:22–23](https://ref.ly/Acts26:22-Acts26:23)). This defense is a model for Christians put on trial for their faith (see [9:15](https://ref.ly/Acts9:15); [Luke 21:12–15](https://ref.ly/Luke21:12-Luke21:15)).

Paul’s question put Agrippa in a bind: If he said he believed the prophets*,* he knew Paul would press home the Christian message; if not, he would offend the devout Jews in his audience. Agrippa knew that Paul wasn’t crazy and that Paul’s testimony about Jesus was historically sound ([26:26](https://ref.ly/Acts26:26)). So Agrippa evaded Paul’s question and refused to face the claims of Christ, alleging that the statement given by Paul was too brief for him to arrive at a responsible decision.

## Acts 26:28 (id: 9549)

“Do you think you can persuade me to become a Christian so quickly?”: This enigmatic remark might have been ironic, incredulous, scoffing, or brushing off Paul’s challenge. It also might have been a direct statement of Paul’s persuasiveness, or a direct statement about or genuine question of Paul’s intention. It seems best to take Agrippa’s reply as deliberately evasive: He didn’t want to admit that he believed the prophets ([26:27](https://ref.ly/Acts26:27)), for Paul had just made a strong case, and the next step would be to believe in Jesus as the promised Messiah to whom the prophets pointed. Agrippa didn’t want to take that step. On the other hand, he didn’t want to say that he didn’t believe the prophets, for that would alienate the Jewish subjects to whose loyalties he wanted to appeal. His non\-committal response underlines his discomfort with Paul’s testimony.

Even in a crisis, the prisoners remained the responsibility of the soldiers (see [12:19](https://ref.ly/Acts12:19); [16:27](https://ref.ly/Acts16:27); [27:32](https://ref.ly/Acts27:32); see study note on 16:27). Fortunately, the commanding officer intervened on their behalf. It was a clear indication of God’s protection and favor that all 276 people made it safely to shore*,* precisely fulfilling the angel’s promise (see [27:24](https://ref.ly/Acts27:24)).

## Acts 28:3–6 (id: 9587)

The locals of Malta understood justice as a personified power or deity carrying out judgment on a criminal. When nothing bad happened to Paul, the natives understood him as having power over snakes and concluded that he himself was a god (cp. [14:11–12](https://ref.ly/Acts14:11-Acts14:12)). In fact, Paul’s survival demonstrated God’s protection (cp. [Mark 16:17–18](https://ref.ly/Mark16:17-Mark16:18)).

Paul was allowed to have his own . . . lodging*,* apparently in private facilities, though he was guarded by a soldier. Though Paul was traveling in chains, “the word of God cannot be chained” ([2 Tim 2:9](https://ref.ly/2Tim2:9)). Paul was possibly treated so well because of his social status or Roman citizenship (cp. [Acts 16:37–38](https://ref.ly/Acts16:37-Acts16:38); [22:25–28](https://ref.ly/Acts22:25-Acts22:28)).

Conscious that the Good News was to be presented to the Jews first ([13:46](https://ref.ly/Acts13:46); [Rom 1:16](https://ref.ly/Rom1:16)) and concerned that the false charges against him might already have reached Rome, Paul summoned the local Jewish leaders and gave an account of his life and work. He insisted that he was guilty of no criminal offense, but strong Jewish opposition had made it necessary for him to appeal to the emperor. Paul had nothing against his own people*;* rather, he wanted to explain his great conviction that the Messiah they had been expecting had already come in the person of Jesus of Nazareth.

## Acts 28:25–28 (id: 9585)

Paul parted with scriptural words of warning that are often used in the New Testament to explain the Jewish rejection of the gospel (cp. [Matt 13:14–15](https://ref.ly/Matt13:14-Matt13:15); [Mark 4:12](https://ref.ly/Mark4:12); [Luke 8:10](https://ref.ly/Luke8:10); [John 12:38–40](https://ref.ly/John12:38-John12:40); see [Rom 11:1–12](https://ref.ly/Rom11:1-Rom11:12), [25–32](https://ref.ly/Rom11:25-Rom11:32)).

Since Jews everywhere had been given an opportunity to accept the faith ([13:46](https://ref.ly/Acts13:46); see [Rom 1:16](https://ref.ly/Rom1:16)), it was now time for the Gentiles to be offered this salvation.

## Acts 28:31 (id: 9588)

Despite being under house arrest ([28:16](https://ref.ly/Acts28:16)), Paul boldly proclaimed the Kingdom message. • And no one tried to stop him (Greek akōlutōs, “without hindrance”): This single word in Greek is the last word of the book of Acts and one of the keys to its meaning: God’s word cannot be chained, even when its messengers are ([2 Tim 2:9](https://ref.ly/2Tim2:9); see [Phil 1:12–14](https://ref.ly/Phil1:12-Phil1:14)). Acts is the story of an unhindered message of Good News, available to all people throughout the world, whether Jew, Gentile, proselyte, rich, or poor. The mission of proclaiming this message is accomplished in the power of the Spirit ([Acts 1:8](https://ref.ly/Acts1:8)); it embraces Jews ([3:1–5:42](https://ref.ly/Acts3:1-Acts5:42)), Samaritans ([8:1–25](https://ref.ly/Acts8:1-Acts8:25)), converts to Judaism ([2:11](https://ref.ly/Acts2:11); [13:43](https://ref.ly/Acts13:43)), “God\-fearers” ([8:26–40](https://ref.ly/Acts8:26-Acts8:40); [9:32–11:18](https://ref.ly/Acts9:32-Acts11:18)), and Gentiles ([13:1–28:28](https://ref.ly/Acts13:1-Acts28:28)). • Luke ends his account with Paul still under house arrest in Rome (about AD 60–62\). Paul was later released and traveled freely. According to tradition, Paul was imprisoned again in Rome about AD 64 and was martyred there during Nero’s persecution of believers.
