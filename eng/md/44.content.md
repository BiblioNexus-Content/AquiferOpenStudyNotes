## Acts 1:1–3 (id: 9275)

Here Luke summarizes his first book, the Gospel of Luke, which Luke had previously written to Theophilus ([Luke 1:3](https://ref.ly/Luke1:3)). Theophilus is elsewhere called “most honorable” ([Luke 1:3](https://ref.ly/Luke1:3))—the title indicates that he was a person of very high social standing (cp. [Acts 23:26](https://ref.ly/Acts23:26); [24:2](https://ref.ly/Acts24:2); [26:25](https://ref.ly/Acts26:25)). He was probably a benefactor or patron who assisted Luke with the expenses of publication or distribution of his work (see study note on Luke 1:3).

## Acts 1:3 (id: 9287)

he proved to them in many ways that he was actually alive: The Gospels describe the evidence for Christ’s resurrection: Jesus’ tomb was empty ([Luke 24:3–4](https://ref.ly/Luke24:3-Luke24:4)), his grave clothes were undisturbed ([John 20:3–9](https://ref.ly/John20:3-John20:9)), and many people saw him (see [Matt 28](https://ref.ly/Matt28:1-Matt28:20); [Mark 16:1–8](https://ref.ly/Mark16:1-Mark16:8); [Luke 24:1–53](https://ref.ly/Luke24:1-Luke24:53); [John 20:11–21:23](https://ref.ly/John20:11-John21:23); [1 Cor 15:3–8](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:3-1Cor15:8)). Jesus appeared to the apostles in part to overcome their doubt ([Matt 28:17](https://ref.ly/Matt28:17); [Luke 24:17–24](https://ref.ly/Luke24:17-Luke24:24), [38](https://ref.ly/Luke24:38), [41](https://ref.ly/Luke24:41); [John 20:27](https://ref.ly/John20:27); see [Mark 16:14](https://ref.ly/Mark16:14)) • The Kingdom of God was the central theme of Jesus’ teaching (see[Acts 1:6–8](https://ref.ly/Acts1:6-Acts1:8); [Matt 4:17](https://ref.ly/Matt4:17); [Mark 1:14–15](https://ref.ly/Mark1:14-Mark1:15); [Luke 4:43](https://ref.ly/Luke4:43)).

## Acts 1:6–11 (id: 9290)

Jesus’ ascent into heaven (see also [Luke 24:50–53](https://ref.ly/Luke24:50-Luke24:53)) took place on the Mount of Olives ([Acts 1:12](https://ref.ly/Acts1:12); [Luke 24:50](https://ref.ly/Luke24:50)). It was Jesus’ last physical appearance—he was taken into heaven, where he will remain “until the time for the final restoration of all things” ([Acts 3:21](https://ref.ly/Acts3:21)).

## Acts 1:8 (id: 9291)

This key verse outlines the geographical extension of the Good News from its Jewish starting point in Jerusalem and Judea ([1:6–8:1](https://ref.ly/Acts1:6-Acts8:1)), out to Samaria ([8:4–25](https://ref.ly/Acts8:4-Acts8:25)), Antioch in Syria ([11:19–30](https://ref.ly/Acts11:19-Acts11:30)), and eventually throughout the Mediterranean world to Rome ([13:1–28:31](https://ref.ly/Acts13:1-Acts28:31)). Christ later gave a similar call to be his witnesses … to the ends of the earth to Saul of Tarsus ([9:15](https://ref.ly/Acts9:15)), who had persecuted the Jewish Christians and then became the primary instrument for taking the Good News to the Gentiles. • The Holy Spirit was the source of power for all this evangelistic and missionary effort.

Jesus promised to return from heaven in the same way (see [Matt 24:30](https://ref.ly/Matt24:30); [Mark 13:26](https://ref.ly/Mark13:26); [John 14:3](https://ref.ly/John14:3)). Jesus has gone to heaven to prepare the place for his followers ([John 12:26](https://ref.ly/John12:26); [14:1–4](https://ref.ly/John14:1-John14:4); [2 Cor 5:4](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:4); [Phil 3:21](https://ref.ly/Phil3:21); [Heb 6:20](https://ref.ly/Heb6:20)).

All eleven of the remaining apostles were present (cp. [Matt 10:2–4](https://ref.ly/Matt10:2-Matt10:4); [Mark 3:16–19](https://ref.ly/Mark3:16-Mark3:19); [Luke 6:13–16](https://ref.ly/Luke6:13-Luke6:16)). Judas Iscariot is omitted from this list on account of his betrayal and death ([Acts 1:18–19](https://ref.ly/Acts1:18-Acts1:19)).

While the apostles waited for the promised gift of the Holy Spirit ([1:4–5](https://ref.ly/Acts1:4-Acts1:5)), the whole company of 120 disciples in Jerusalem engaged in earnest prayer ([1:13–14](https://ref.ly/Acts1:13-Acts1:14)) and then appointed an apostle to replace Judas Iscariot ([1:15–26](https://ref.ly/Acts1:15-Acts1:26)).

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 1:13–ACT 1:26

## Acts 1:14 (id: 9281)

The first disciples were united in worship, fellowship, and prayer (see also [2:42](https://ref.ly/Acts2:42), [46–47](https://ref.ly/Acts2:46-Acts2:47); [4:24–31](https://ref.ly/Acts4:24-Acts4:31); [5:12](https://ref.ly/Acts5:12); [12:5](https://ref.ly/Acts12:5); [13:1–3](https://ref.ly/Acts13:1-Acts13:3)). The faithful women who had been witnesses of Jesus’ crucifixion and resurrection were present ([Luke 23:49](https://ref.ly/Luke23:49), [54–56](https://ref.ly/Luke23:54-Luke23:56); [24:1–10](https://ref.ly/Luke24:1-Luke24:10), [22](https://ref.ly/Luke24:22)). • The brothers of Jesus had not believed in him during his ministry ([John 7:3–5](https://ref.ly/John7:3-John7:5); cp. [Matt 12:46–49](https://ref.ly/Matt12:46-Matt12:49)), but became his disciples after his resurrection.

Matthew’s account ([Matt 27:3–10](https://ref.ly/Matt27:3-Matt27:10)) is somewhat different; the two can be harmonized by considering the priests’ purchase of the “Field of Blood” as acting in Judas’s name. In addition, Judas may have committed suicide by hanging, but he subsequently fell headfirst and his body split open*,* perhaps when the rope broke.

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 1:18–ACT 1:19

## Acts 1:20–21 (id: 9284)

‘Let someone else take his position’: It was imperative that a replacement be found for Judas so that his position as the twelfth apostle would not remain empty. The new people of God, like Israel, were to have twelve designated and appointed leaders (see [Matt 19:28](https://ref.ly/Matt19:28); [Luke 22:29–30](https://ref.ly/Luke22:29-Luke22:30)).

## Acts 1:23–26 (id: 9286)

With prayer ([1:14](https://ref.ly/Acts1:14), [24](https://ref.ly/Acts1:24)) and humble dependence on God to reveal his will, the apostles cast lots*,* using an established method of finding God’s will (see [Lev 16:8](https://ref.ly/Lev16:8); [Num 27:21](https://ref.ly/Num27:21); [Deut 33:8](https://ref.ly/Deut33:8); [Josh 14:2](https://ref.ly/Josh14:2); [18:3–10](https://ref.ly/Josh18:3-Josh18:10); [Prov 16:33](https://ref.ly/Prov16:33)). Matthias was selected to replace Judas. After Pentecost, the Holy Spirit guided Jesus’ followers through dreams, visions, and prophecies instead of through lots (cp. [Acts 2:17–18](https://ref.ly/Acts2:17-Acts2:18); [13:2](https://ref.ly/Acts13:2); [16:7–10](https://ref.ly/Acts16:7-Acts16:10)). • you know every heart: See also [1 Sam 16:6–7](https://ref.ly/1Sam16:6-1Sam16:7); [1 Kgs 8:39](https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:39); [1 Chr 28:9](https://ref.ly/1Chr28:9); [2 Chr 6:30](https://ref.ly/2Chr6:30); [Pss 7:9](https://ref.ly/Ps7:9); [44:21](https://ref.ly/Ps44:21); [Jer 11:20](https://ref.ly/Jer11:20); [John 2:24–25](https://ref.ly/John2:24-John2:25); [Rev 2:23](https://ref.ly/Rev2:23).

## Acts 2:1–4 (id: 9449)

Jews observed three great annual pilgrimage festivals, when many would go to the Temple in Jerusalem—Unleavened Bread (which includes Passover), Pentecost (Harvest), and Shelters (see [Lev 23:1–44](https://ref.ly/Lev23:1-Lev23:44)). On Pentecost, when the Jewish people were gathered in Jerusalem to celebrate the harvest of God’s blessings, and when the disciples were united and expectant as they gathered for prayer, the Holy Spirit came and filled the gathered believers.

## Acts 2:4 (id: 9460)

everyone present was filled with the Holy Spirit: This event marks the coming of the Holy Spirit to fill Jesus’ disciples, as he had promised, so that they could be powerful witnesses ([1:4–5](https://ref.ly/Acts1:4-Acts1:5), [8](https://ref.ly/Acts1:8)). The Spirit’s wisdom, energy, and power were the driving force behind the church’s work and witness (e.g., [2:14–41](https://ref.ly/Acts2:14-Acts2:41), [43](https://ref.ly/Acts2:43); [4:31](https://ref.ly/Acts4:31); [9:17](https://ref.ly/Acts9:17), [20](https://ref.ly/Acts9:20); [13:9–12](https://ref.ly/Acts13:9-Acts13:12); see also [Eph 5:18](https://ref.ly/Eph5:18)). • began speaking in other languages: The Holy Spirit gave extraordinary communication that made it possible for people from other countries to hear in their own languages about what God had done ([Acts 2:6–11](https://ref.ly/Acts2:6-Acts2:11)). This passage is one of several references to speaking in “other languages” or “tongues” (see also [10:44–48](https://ref.ly/Acts10:44-Acts10:48); [19:6](https://ref.ly/Acts19:6); [1 Cor 14:2–28](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:2-1Cor14:28), [39](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:39)). Here, this supernatural gift reveals the energizing presence of God’s Spirit and inaugurates the proclamation of the Good News to people of every nation.

## Acts 2:5–11 (id: 9461)

Because Pentecost was a pilgrimage festival (see study note on 2:1–4), Jews from every nation were present in Jerusalem at that time and were thus able to hear the Good News being proclaimed in their own languages. The Good News is for all people ([2:38–39](https://ref.ly/Acts2:38-Acts2:39)).

## Acts 2:9–11 (id: 9462)

Parthians came from the region stretching from the Tigris River eastward to India. Medes (now called Kurds) were from Media, east of Mesopotamia and north of the Persian Gulf. Elamites were from Elam (now in Iran), north of the Persian Gulf and just east of the Tigris River. Mesopotamia lay between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Judea was well known as the Jewish homeland. Cappadocia, Pontus, and Asia were Roman provinces in Asia Minor (now in Turkey; see [1 Pet 1:1](https://ref.ly/1Pet1:1)); Paul later taught and preached in some of these areas (see [Acts 16:6](https://ref.ly/Acts16:6); [19:10](https://ref.ly/Acts19:10), [26](https://ref.ly/Acts19:26)). Phrygia and Pamphylia were districts of Asia Minor later visited by Paul ([13:13](https://ref.ly/Acts13:13); [18:23](https://ref.ly/Acts18:23)). Egypt had a large Jewish population, particularly in the city of Alexandria (see [18:24](https://ref.ly/Acts18:24)). North Africa was also represented by Libya and Cyrene. Rome was the imperial capital and the home of thousands of Jews. The Cretans came from the island of Crete, located south\-southeast of Greece, and the Arabs from the area south and east of Jerusalem. • The inclusion of all of these nations suggests how the Good News was going to go out to the ends of the earth ([1:8](https://ref.ly/Acts1:8)).

## Acts 2:14–36 (id: 9451)

This is the first of about thirty speeches in Acts and one of the most important, standing as it does at the very inception of the church. It is a typical example of the preaching of the apostles, who proclaimed (1\) that the Old Testament promises had been fulfilled in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, who is the promised Messiah; (2\) that the apostles themselves were eyewitnesses of Jesus’ entire public ministry and were his chosen representatives; (3\) that people are called to repent of their sins and have faith in God through Christ; and (4\) that salvation and the presence of the Holy Spirit are promised to those who respond affirmatively to this message of Good News. This basic message is echoed in the sermons of chs [3](https://ref.ly/Acts3:1-Acts3:26), [4](https://ref.ly/Acts4:1-Acts4:37), [5](https://ref.ly/Acts5:1-Acts5:42), [8](https://ref.ly/Acts8:1-Acts8:40), [10](https://ref.ly/Acts10:1-Acts10:48), [and 13](https://ref.ly/Acts13:1-Acts13:52). The same themes characterized Paul’s preaching (see [1 Cor 15:3–9](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:3-1Cor15:9)). This message was repeatedly preached to both Jews and Gentiles throughout the Mediterranean world; all people are summoned to repent of their sins and turn to God through faith in Jesus Christ.

This passage quotes [Joel 2:28–32](https://ref.ly/Joel2:28-Joel2:32). The prophet Joel predicted a wider exercise of the gifts of prophecy, including visions and dreams by both young and old, both men and women in the last days ([Joel 2:28–29](https://ref.ly/Joel2:28-Joel2:29)). In Acts, on the day of Pentecost, Peter declared that Joel’s prophecy was being fulfilled, signaling that “the last days” had arrived.

God raised Jesus from the dead, and we are all witnesses of this: The witness theme is often repeated in Acts (e.g., [3:15](https://ref.ly/Acts3:15); [4:33](https://ref.ly/Acts4:33); [5:32](https://ref.ly/Acts5:32); [10:39–43](https://ref.ly/Acts10:39-Acts10:43)). The capstone of this message is that God the Father, as he had promised*,* was now pouring out his Holy Spirit on the church through the risen Jesus. All Israel was called upon to recognize that God had acted decisively to make the crucified Jesus both Lord and Messiah!

Jesus’ promise that his disciples would do even greater works than he had done ([John 14:12](https://ref.ly/John14:12); see [Mark 16:20](https://ref.ly/Mark16:20)) was fulfilled in the signs, wonders, and mighty works of the apostles ([Acts 2:43](https://ref.ly/Acts2:43); [5:12](https://ref.ly/Acts5:12); [8:4–8](https://ref.ly/Acts8:4-Acts8:8)). Here, Peter clearly exercised the power to heal in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene ([3:6](https://ref.ly/Acts3:6), [16](https://ref.ly/Acts3:16)). The cure was instant and undeniable ([3:8](https://ref.ly/Acts3:8)), resulting in the man’s praising God ([3:8–9](https://ref.ly/Acts3:8-Acts3:9); cp. [2:47](https://ref.ly/Acts2:47); [16:25](https://ref.ly/Acts16:25); [Luke 2:20](https://ref.ly/Luke2:20); [17:15–18](https://ref.ly/Luke17:15-Luke17:18); [18:43](https://ref.ly/Luke18:43); [19:37](https://ref.ly/Luke19:37); [24:53](https://ref.ly/Luke24:53)). This is the first of many demonstrations of divine power given to disciples in Acts ([Acts 4:24–31](https://ref.ly/Acts4:24-Acts4:31); [5:12](https://ref.ly/Acts5:12); [6:8](https://ref.ly/Acts6:8); [8:6](https://ref.ly/Acts8:6); [9:33–42](https://ref.ly/Acts9:33-Acts9:42); [28:8](https://ref.ly/Acts28:8)).

The Beautiful Gate was probably the Nicanor Gate, built of Corinthian bronze and located on the east side of the Temple (see Josephus, *War* 5\.5\.3\).

The evangelistic speeches in the book of Acts focus on Jesus*,* the crucified and risen Lord.

## Acts 4:1–22 (id: 9601)

Persecution was a common experience of God’s people throughout the Bible. God’s servants often faced hostility and opposition ([Deut 30:7](https://ref.ly/Deut30:7); [1 Kgs 18:13](https://ref.ly/1Kgs18:13); [Neh 4:1–3](https://ref.ly/Neh4:1-Neh4:3); [Jer 37–38](https://ref.ly/Jer37:1-Jer38:28); [Matt 23:34–37](https://ref.ly/Matt23:34-Matt23:37); [Luke 11:49–51](https://ref.ly/Luke11:49-Luke11:51); [1 Thes 2:14–15](https://ref.ly/1Thess2:14-1Thess2:15)). Jesus himself was persecuted ([Luke 4:29](https://ref.ly/Luke4:29); [John 5:16](https://ref.ly/John5:16)), and he told his disciples to expect the same kind of treatment ([Matt 10:23](https://ref.ly/Matt10:23); [24:9](https://ref.ly/Matt24:9); [Mark 13:9](https://ref.ly/Mark13:9); [Luke 21:12](https://ref.ly/Luke21:12); [John 16:2](https://ref.ly/John16:2)), but he promised that the Holy Spirit would provide strength ([Acts 1:8](https://ref.ly/Acts1:8); [Luke 12:11–12](https://ref.ly/Luke12:11-Luke12:12); [21:15](https://ref.ly/Luke21:15)). Acts records frequent times of persecution ([Acts 4:3](https://ref.ly/Acts4:3); [5:17–41](https://ref.ly/Acts5:17-Acts5:41); [7:54–8:3](https://ref.ly/Acts7:54-Acts8:3); [9:1–2](https://ref.ly/Acts9:1-Acts9:2); [11:19](https://ref.ly/Acts11:19); [12:2](https://ref.ly/Acts12:2); [13:50](https://ref.ly/Acts13:50); [14:19](https://ref.ly/Acts14:19); [16:19–24](https://ref.ly/Acts16:19-Acts16:24)), but Acts also reiterates that the Holy Spirit empowers disciples to bear witness in such circumstances ([2:44](https://ref.ly/Acts2:44); [4:8–13](https://ref.ly/Acts4:8-Acts4:13); [6:10](https://ref.ly/Acts6:10); [7:55](https://ref.ly/Acts7:55)).

Luke is fond of balancing a positive example with a negative example. He has just recorded the remarkable story of Barnabas ([4:36–37](https://ref.ly/Acts4:36-Acts4:37)). Now Luke presents the opposite conduct of Ananias and Sapphira*,* who were tempted by the desire to be held in high regard. Ananias had not been forced to sell his property or to give the proceeds away. The couple’s sin was in their pretense and deception.

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 5:1–ACT 5:11
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Acts 5:3–4 (id: 9620)

In lying about their property sale, Ananias was not just lying to others but to the Holy Spirit—that is, to God. His actions compromised the transparent sincerity, unity, and integrity of the church at its very foundation, and thus he fell under the direct judgment of God (cp. [Lev 10:1–5](https://ref.ly/Lev10:1-Lev10:5); [Josh 7:16–26](https://ref.ly/Josh7:16-Josh7:26)).

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 5:3–ACT 5:4
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Acts 5:11 (id: 9614)

Great fear gripped the entire church and everyone else who heard what had happened: The sudden judgment on Ananias and then on Sapphira had a sobering effect on both the Christian community and those who heard about this incident (cp. [Heb 10:31](https://ref.ly/Heb10:31)). Believers were forcefully reminded that they needed to be pure, and for non\-Christians the believers’ integrity was reestablished, so that once again “all the people had high regard for them” ([Acts 5:13](https://ref.ly/Acts5:13)). Yet it also made outsiders wary of joining a movement with such high standards ([5:13](https://ref.ly/Acts5:13)). This divine “pruning” (see [John 15:1–11](https://ref.ly/John15:1-John15:11)) helped new growth to follow ([Acts 5:14](https://ref.ly/Acts5:14); cp.

The success of the apostles’ ministry again aroused strong opposition (cp. [4:1–3](https://ref.ly/Acts4:1-Acts4:3)). The wealthy and powerful Sadducees controlled the Temple establishment and had a Temple police force at their disposal. They opposed belief in the resurrection and were determined not to allow the apostles to proclaim their message about the resurrection of Jesus unchallenged. They also sensed that their hold on the Jewish people was loosening, so, filled with jealousy*,* they attacked the apostles.

The irony here is that the Sadducees denied the existence of angels ([23:8](https://ref.ly/Acts23:8)).

Wisely, the apostles called a meeting of all the believers to address the dispute. They recognized the seriousness of the problem, as well as their own priority of teaching the word of God. The solution was to select wise and Spirit\-filled men to oversee the food distribution. The community accepted the apostles’ solution and chose good leaders from the ranks of the Greek\-speaking believers (all of their names are Greek). These seven devoted themselves to this special ministry, allowing the apostles to spend their time in prayer and teaching the word. • These seven men are sometimes called the first deacons because of the similarity of their role to the office of deacon (see [1 Tim 3:8–13](https://ref.ly/1Tim3:8-1Tim3:13)). Although the Greek term translated “deacon” (Greek diakonos, “servant”) is not used here, a related Greek word is translated running a food program ([6:2](https://ref.ly/Acts6:2); Greek diakonein*,* “to serve”).

Stephen responded to the accusations by testifying about his Lord (cp. [Luke 21:12–17](https://ref.ly/Luke21:12-Luke21:17)). Instead of defending himself against their prosecution, he became a witness in God’s prosecution of them, exposing their stubbornness and unfaithfulness to God. Stephen’s recital of Israel’s past reminded them of their repeated rejections of those whom God had sent. • Stephen’s review of Israel’s history has three principal parts, dealing with the work of the patriarchs ([Acts 7:2–16](https://ref.ly/Acts7:2-Acts7:16)), the ministry of Moses ([7:17–43](https://ref.ly/Acts7:17-Acts7:43)), and the role of the Tabernacle and the Temple ([7:44–50](https://ref.ly/Acts7:44-Acts7:50)). Stephen followed up his historical survey with a clear attack on the hard\-heartedness of his own people. With a prophetic challenge, he urged them to stop rebelling against the Holy Spirit and turn to God with repentance and faith.

Compare this figure with the *seventy* mentioned in the Hebrew text of [Gen 46:27](https://ref.ly/Gen46:27).

The Septuagint includes three descendants of Ephraim and two of Manasseh at [Gen 46:20](https://ref.ly/Gen46:20), making for a total of five more persons, whereas the Hebrew text does not include descendants for Joseph’s sons.

Stephen raised the same charge that God had raised against his people in the wilderness: that they were heathen at heart and deaf to the truth*,* because they were rejecting the gospel and obstinately resisting the Holy Spirit (see [Exod 32:9](https://ref.ly/Exod32:9); [33:3](https://ref.ly/Exod33:3); [34:9](https://ref.ly/Exod34:9); [Deut 9:6](https://ref.ly/Deut9:6), [13](https://ref.ly/Deut9:13); [31:27](https://ref.ly/Deut31:27); see also [Ps 78:8](https://ref.ly/Ps78:8); [Zech 7:11–12](https://ref.ly/Zech7:11-Zech7:12)).

Jesus standing … at God’s right hand: Usually Jesus is described as *seated* in heaven at God’s right hand ([2:33–34](https://ref.ly/Acts2:33-Acts2:34); [5:31](https://ref.ly/Acts5:31); [Luke 20:42](https://ref.ly/Luke20:42); [22:69](https://ref.ly/Luke22:69); [Rom 8:34](https://ref.ly/Rom8:34); [Eph 1:20](https://ref.ly/Eph1:20); [Col 3:1](https://ref.ly/Col3:1); [Heb 1:3](https://ref.ly/Heb1:3), [13](https://ref.ly/Heb1:13); [10:12](https://ref.ly/Heb10:12)). One possible explanation is that Jesus was welcoming Stephen, the first martyr, to heaven with honor. Stephen had confessed his Lord faithfully on earth, and now his Lord honored his promise to confess his faithful servant in heaven, standing as a witness to defend him ([Matt 10:32](https://ref.ly/Matt10:32); [Luke 12:8](https://ref.ly/Luke12:8)). • the Son of Man standing: Cp. [Dan 7:13–14](https://ref.ly/Dan7:13-Dan7:14). The Jewish leaders understood that Stephen was speaking of Jesus as the divine Son of Man ([Acts 7:57](https://ref.ly/Acts7:57)), a title that speaks of Jesus’ power and authority (cp. [Rev 1:12–15](https://ref.ly/Rev1:12-Rev1:15)).

Stephen’s prayer, Lord, don’t charge them with this sin*,* is strikingly similar to Jesus’ prayer at his crucifixion ([Luke 23:34](https://ref.ly/Luke23:34)). Jesus clearly taught his followers the importance of both forgiveness ([Matt 6:14–15](https://ref.ly/Matt6:14-Matt6:15); [Mark 11:25](https://ref.ly/Mark11:25); see [Luke 11:4](https://ref.ly/Luke11:4); [17:3–4](https://ref.ly/Luke17:3-Luke17:4)) and prayer ([Luke 11:5–10](https://ref.ly/Luke11:5-Luke11:10); [18:1–8](https://ref.ly/Luke18:1-Luke18:8); see also [Acts 1:12–15](https://ref.ly/Acts1:12-Acts1:15); [4:23–31](https://ref.ly/Acts4:23-Acts4:31); [12:5](https://ref.ly/Acts12:5); [Jas 5:16–18](https://ref.ly/Jas5:16-Jas5:18)).

In the ancient world, a eunuch was an official, typically castrated, who served in a royal court (see [2 Kgs 9:30–32](https://ref.ly/2Kgs9:30-2Kgs9:32); [Esth 1:10](https://ref.ly/Esth1:10); [2:3](https://ref.ly/Esth2:3), [14–15](https://ref.ly/Esth2:14-Esth2:15), [21](https://ref.ly/Esth2:21); [4:4–5](https://ref.ly/Esth4:4-Esth4:5)). Eunuchs were often scorned by Jews because they could not perpetuate the covenant family, and the law of Moses excluded men who had damaged genitals from the assembly of Israel ([Deut 23:1](https://ref.ly/Deut23:1); cp. [Lev 21:17–23](https://ref.ly/Lev21:17-Lev21:23)), but Isaiah spoke of God’s acceptance of Gentiles and eunuchs ([Isa 56:3–8](https://ref.ly/Isa56:3-Isa56:8); see also [Matt 19:12](https://ref.ly/Matt19:12)). In the new covenant, all who have genuine faith have a place among the people of God. • The eunuch had traveled from Africa to Jerusalem to worship in the Temple, probably for one of the great Jewish festivals.

## Acts 9:1–19 (id: 9653)

The conversion of Saul of Tarsus on the Damascus road is of central importance to the narrative of Acts—Luke recounts the story three times (also [22:1–21](https://ref.ly/Acts22:1-Acts22:21); [26:1–29](https://ref.ly/Acts26:1-Acts26:29)). Paul (Saul) also alludes to this experience several times in his letters ([1 Cor 15:8–10](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:8-1Cor15:10); [Gal 1:11–17](https://ref.ly/Gal1:11-Gal1:17); [Phil 3:4–11](https://ref.ly/Phil3:4-Phil3:11); see [1 Tim 1:12–17](https://ref.ly/1Tim1:12-1Tim1:17)). Saul’s conversion was his prophetic call and commission as an apostle ([Acts 9:15](https://ref.ly/Acts9:15); [22:15](https://ref.ly/Acts22:15), [21](https://ref.ly/Acts22:21); [26:15–18](https://ref.ly/Acts26:15-Acts26:18)). No one is beyond the power of God to reach, redeem, and use for holy purposes—nothing is impossible with God ([Luke 1:37](https://ref.ly/Luke1:37)). Paul was prepared through his training, upbringing, and experience to play a unique role in taking the gospel into the broader world as the “apostle to the Gentiles” ([Rom 11:13](https://ref.ly/Rom11:13); see [1 Cor 15:9](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:9); [2 Cor 12:11–12](https://ref.ly/2Cor12:11-2Cor12:12); [Gal 1:1](https://ref.ly/Gal1:1); [Eph 3:8](https://ref.ly/Eph3:8)).

## Acts 9:2 (id: 9662)

The synagogues (Greek sunagōgē, “gathering place”) were local Jewish meeting places. After the Exile, Jews began to meet in local synagogues as places of instruction and centers of worship. Synagogue services consisted of the reading of the Law and the Prophets, exposition of the Scriptures, prayer, praise, and thanksgiving (see [13:15](https://ref.ly/Acts13:15); [15:21](https://ref.ly/Acts15:21); [Neh 9:5](https://ref.ly/Neh9:5); [Matt 6:5](https://ref.ly/Matt6:5); [Luke 4:16–21](https://ref.ly/Luke4:16-Luke4:21)). Jesus attended, taught, preached, and performed miracles in synagogues ([Matt 12:9–10](https://ref.ly/Matt12:9-Matt12:10); [Mark 1:21](https://ref.ly/Mark1:21), [39](https://ref.ly/Mark1:39); [Luke 4:16](https://ref.ly/Luke4:16); [13:10–13](https://ref.ly/Luke13:10-Luke13:13); [John 6:59](https://ref.ly/John6:59); [18:20](https://ref.ly/John18:20)), as did the apostles (see [Acts 9:20](https://ref.ly/Acts9:20); [13:5](https://ref.ly/Acts13:5), [14](https://ref.ly/Acts13:14); [14:1](https://ref.ly/Acts14:1); [17:1](https://ref.ly/Acts17:1), [10](https://ref.ly/Acts17:10), [17](https://ref.ly/Acts17:17); [18:4](https://ref.ly/Acts18:4), [19](https://ref.ly/Acts18:19), [26](https://ref.ly/Acts18:26)). • Damascus*,* the capital of Syria, was an important center with a long and distinguished past and the nearest major city outside of Palestine. It took from four to six days to reach Damascus from Jerusalem, a fact that highlights Saul’s earnestness ([9:1–5](https://ref.ly/Acts9:1-Acts9:5); see [22:4–8](https://ref.ly/Acts22:4-Acts22:8); [26:9–15](https://ref.ly/Acts26:9-Acts26:15)). • The expression the Way is used in Acts for Christianity (see [19:9](https://ref.ly/Acts19:9), [23](https://ref.ly/Acts19:23); [24:14](https://ref.ly/Acts24:14), [22](https://ref.ly/Acts24:22))—it is “the way of God” ([18:26](https://ref.ly/Acts18:26)) that tells people “how to be saved” ([16:17](https://ref.ly/Acts16:17), literally *the way of salvation*).

Saul of Tarsus (Paul) was God’s choice to spearhead this expansive missionary effort to bring the Christian message to the Gentiles and to kings, as well as to the people of Israel.

Fortunately, Barnabas, the “Son of Encouragement” ([4:36](https://ref.ly/Acts4:36)), introduced the changed man to the apostles and explained his encounter with the Lord at Damascus*,* his sense of calling, and his subsequent boldness in preaching in the name of Jesus in Damascus. Barnabas was able to convince the apostles that Saul’s conversion was genuine, so Saul remained with the apostles in Jerusalem, where he preached boldly for his Lord.

Peter repeatedly underscores the importance of the apostolic witnesses to the message of Good News. The apostles ate and drank with Jesus (see [Luke 24:41–43](https://ref.ly/Luke24:41-Luke24:43)) and were eyewitnesses of his resurrection, so they could attest that he had conquered death (see [Acts 3:15](https://ref.ly/Acts3:15); [4:33](https://ref.ly/Acts4:33); [13:30–31](https://ref.ly/Acts13:30-Acts13:31)). The original apostles were chosen in advance to be his witnesses (see [1:12–26](https://ref.ly/Acts1:12-Acts1:26)); gradually, others such as Paul and Barnabas carried on this powerful preaching and teaching in the name of Jesus Christ ([9:15](https://ref.ly/Acts9:15); [14:1–3](https://ref.ly/Acts14:1-Acts14:3); [26:16](https://ref.ly/Acts26:16)).

On the day of Pentecost, Peter told the assembly that if they would repent, turn to God, and be baptized in the name of Jesus for the forgiveness of sins, they would receive “the gift of the Holy Spirit” ([2:38](https://ref.ly/Acts2:38); cp. [19:1–7](https://ref.ly/Acts19:1-Acts19:7)). As Cornelius and his household listened to Peter’s message, the Holy Spirit fell upon them, too, and they were baptized. They received the Holy Spirit just as the Jews did, so clearly God had shown no partiality ([10:34–35](https://ref.ly/Acts10:34-Acts10:35)). This event parallels the day of Pentecost in Jerusalem ([2:1–47](https://ref.ly/Acts2:1-Acts2:47)) and marks the spread of the Holy Spirit’s power to Gentiles ([1:8](https://ref.ly/Acts1:8); [2:39](https://ref.ly/Acts2:39)).

Peter reviewed the sequence of events, explaining that the whole development was the result of God’s initiative ([11:12](https://ref.ly/Acts11:12)). Peter had eaten with Gentiles because God had made it clear that he should ([11:4–12](https://ref.ly/Acts11:4-Acts11:12)). Peter had then observed the Holy Spirit’s definite action of coming upon Gentiles, and he realized that they were being accepted and blessed by God just as Jewish believers had been ([11:15–17](https://ref.ly/Acts11:15-Acts11:17); see [1:5](https://ref.ly/Acts1:5)).

The upshot of Agabus’s prophecy was that the believers in Antioch decided to make a contribution to the Jewish believers—the brothers and sisters—in Judea.

This unified love and support of Christians for one another was a tangible demonstration of the difference Christ had made in their lives.

Jesus had clearly predicted persecution and hardship for his followers ([Luke 11:49–51](https://ref.ly/Luke11:49-Luke11:51)).

The excitement caused by the apostles’ preaching led to a mass turnout on the following week. This response provoked the jealousy of some of the Jews (cp.

Paul met this hostility with a bold declaration that these Jews had had their opportunity to hear the word of God*,* and that since they had rejected it, the offer of salvation would now be given to the Gentiles (cp. [Acts 10:34–35](https://ref.ly/Acts10:34-Acts10:35)), in accord with the Lord’s command in Scripture. The local Gentiles welcomed the Good News and many responded to it, so the Lord’s message was carried throughout that region.

The first person changed by Christ in Philippi was Lydia*,* a successful businesswoman from Thyatira (modern Akhisar), a city of western Asia Minor famous for its woolen fabrics, weavers, and linens. Lydia responded to the message and she and her household were baptized (cp. [16:32–33](https://ref.ly/Acts16:32-Acts16:33)). • One of Lydia’s first acts as a true believer in the Lord was to extend hospitality to the visiting missionaries. Hospitality is an important Christian virtue ([Matt 25:31–46](https://ref.ly/Matt25:31-Matt25:46); [Rom 12:13](https://ref.ly/Rom12:13); [16:23](https://ref.ly/Rom16:23); [1 Tim 3:2](https://ref.ly/1Tim3:2); [Titus 1:8](https://ref.ly/Titus1:8); [Heb 13:2](https://ref.ly/Heb13:2); [1 Pet 4:9](https://ref.ly/1Pet4:9); [3 Jn 1:5–8](https://ref.ly/3John1:5-3John1:8); cp.

The second portrait of a changed life in Philippi is of a slave girl who had a spirit that enabled her to tell the future. • Even though the demon within her was stating the truth, Paul, like Jesus, did not permit it to proclaim the Christian message (cp. [Mark 1:25](https://ref.ly/Mark1:25), [34](https://ref.ly/Mark1:34); [3:11–12](https://ref.ly/Mark3:11-Mark3:12); [Luke 4:35](https://ref.ly/Luke4:35), [41](https://ref.ly/Luke4:41)). The Lord had commanded that the gospel be proclaimed by his disciples, not by opponents ([Acts 1:8](https://ref.ly/Acts1:8); [9:15](https://ref.ly/Acts9:15); [26:15–18](https://ref.ly/Acts26:15-Acts26:18); [Matt 28:18–20](https://ref.ly/Matt28:18-Matt28:20); [Luke 24:46–49](https://ref.ly/Luke24:46-Luke24:49); [John 20:21](https://ref.ly/John20:21); see[Acts 22:15](https://ref.ly/Acts22:15)).

The slave girl’s exploiters viciously attacked the missionaries and dragged them before the authorities as criminals, blamed them for fomenting a disturbance, resorted to racial bias (these Jews), and appealed to the Philippians’ pride (us Romans*;* the Philippians prided themselves on being Roman citizens of a Roman colony). • customs that are illegal: By law, Jews were not permitted to make converts of Romans.

Paul and Silas were both Roman citizens*,* so the beating and imprisonment ([16:22–24](https://ref.ly/Acts16:22-Acts16:24)) had been illegal. After the city officials learned of this, they were justifiably alarmed because they had committed a crime against Rome. • Let them come themselves to release us: Paul made use of his rights as a Roman citizen in order to clear his name and ensure that no disrepute would attach to the Christian message or those who accepted it. Luke intended to show that Christianity should enjoy the same status as Judaism in the Roman Empire as a permitted religion—the Christian faith was compatible with the life of a Roman citizen. Accordingly, it was important to note that Paul made use of his rights as a Roman citizen (cp. [22:25–27](https://ref.ly/Acts22:25-Acts22:27)) and was ready to use the privileges of citizenship to advance the cause of Christ in a hostile world.

In this chapter, we see Paul presented as a model witness for Christ, engaging the thinkers of his day and challenging them with the Christian message. Paul quoted writers his audience would be familiar with and showed the relevance of the gospel by dialoguing with them, critiquing their assumptions, and offering Jesus as a constructive alternative (see [Col 1:28](https://ref.ly/Col1:28)). Paul reminded these proud intellectuals that there is a living God to whom all human beings are answerable; that they will be judged by him through Jesus, whom God raised from the dead; and that they should therefore repent and put their faith in Jesus.

Epicurean … philosophers: Epicureanism was a popular school of Greek philosophy, founded by Epicurus (341–270 BC). Epicureans believed that the principal aim of life was to secure happiness. They thought of pleasure not in terms of sensual indulgence, as their critics charged, but in terms of tranquility. Their contemporaries often called them atheists; in their view, there were no gods to fear, and death simply marked the end of human existence. They sought their security in organized communities where they could live in contentment apart from society. • Stoic philosophers: Stoicism was founded by Zeno of Citium (335–263 BC) and became the most influential philosophy in the Greco\-Roman world. It viewed the universe as permeated by Reason (sometimes referred to as God or Providence). Stoicism saw divine Reason as expressed in human reason and held that as humans made progress, they could advance from ignorance (the source of vice) to true knowledge (the source of virtue). They developed extensive lists of virtues and vices and produced detailed household codes to guide family behavior. Paul’s teaching resembles that of the Stoics in his use of household codes and lists of virtues and vices ([Gal 5:19–23](https://ref.ly/Gal5:19-Gal5:23); [Eph 5:22–33](https://ref.ly/Eph5:22-Eph5:33); [Col 3:18–4:1](https://ref.ly/Col3:18-Col4:1); [1 Tim 3:1–13](https://ref.ly/1Tim3:1-1Tim3:13); [5:1–6:1](https://ref.ly/1Tim5:1-1Tim5:6)). However, Paul’s message of Good News—focusing on the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ—was strange and foreign to these Greek philosophers. • The air of superiority with which they addressed Paul as this babbler indicates their arrogance.

Paul’s remarkable sermon in Athens reveals his versatility in preaching the Good News ([Rom 11:14](https://ref.ly/Rom11:14); [1 Cor 9:19–23](https://ref.ly/1Cor9:19-1Cor9:23); [10:33](https://ref.ly/1Cor10:33); cp. [Acts 16:3](https://ref.ly/Acts16:3); [17:2–3](https://ref.ly/Acts17:2-Acts17:3); [21:20–26](https://ref.ly/Acts21:20-Acts21:26)). While Paul’s Greek audience did not know the Scriptures or have a tradition of monotheism as the Jews did, they did have a rich intellectual heritage. So Paul established a point of contact on the basis of an Athenian inscription to an Unknown God. He then explained God’s nature as the Creator ([17:22–29](https://ref.ly/Acts17:22-Acts17:29)), followed by God’s purpose as the Redeemer ([17:30–31](https://ref.ly/Acts17:30-Acts17:31)). • As he did elsewhere in his own writings (see [1 Cor 15:33](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:33); [Titus 1:12](https://ref.ly/Titus1:12)), Paul made use of the Greek poets. There are several points of connection in this sermon with the *Hymn to Zeus* by Cleanthes (about 315–240 BC). Paul was probably quoting Epimenides, who had declared about God, “In him we live and move and exist” (Epimenides, *Cretica,* about 600 BC). Paul also cited Aratus, a Stoic poet from Cilicia (about 315–240 BC), who had commented, “We are his offspring” (Aratus, *Phaenomena* 5\). These allusions to their own poets established connections with his audience. Paul was then able to present the singular nature of God ([Acts 17:29](https://ref.ly/Acts17:29)), and he stressed the coming judgment through Jesus Christ, whom God had raised from the dead. This message, while touching on Greek culture and philosophy, had a clear focus on Christ that presented the challenge of Christ to a cultured and intellectual but idolatrous people.

The idea of people’s ignorance is carefully discussed both in the Old Testament law ([Lev 4:2](https://ref.ly/Lev4:2), [22](https://ref.ly/Lev4:22), [27](https://ref.ly/Lev4:27); [5:15](https://ref.ly/Lev5:15), [17](https://ref.ly/Lev5:17); [Num 15:25](https://ref.ly/Num15:25), [27](https://ref.ly/Num15:27)) and in the New Testament ([Eph 4:18](https://ref.ly/Eph4:18); [1 Pet 1:14](https://ref.ly/1Pet1:14); [2:15](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:15); [2 Pet 3:5](https://ref.ly/2Pet3:5), [8](https://ref.ly/2Pet3:8)).

Similarly, the Jews in Jerusalem later listened carefully to Paul until he mentioned God’s acceptance of the Gentiles ([Acts 22:22](https://ref.ly/Acts22:22)).

It was important to him that these young converts not be left to founder and shipwreck their faith (see [Eph 6:10–20](https://ref.ly/Eph6:10-Eph6:20); [1 Tim 1:18–20](https://ref.ly/1Tim1:18-1Tim1:20); [2 Tim 1:15](https://ref.ly/2Tim1:15); [4:10](https://ref.ly/2Tim4:10)).

Alexandria*,* the second\-largest city in the Roman Empire, was famous for its rhetorical tradition and the philosophical work of Philo. Apollos was an eloquent speaker with an excellent knowledge of the Scriptures (the Old Testament). His knowledge about Jesus and the Holy Spirit was inadequate, though. He did not understand that believers could experience and enjoy the power of the Holy Spirit as a present energizing reality. Fortunately, Priscilla and Aquila took him aside and corrected his spiritual understanding.

Paul traveled to Ephesus after Apollos had left. Subsequently, Apollos returned to Ephesus while Paul was still working there ([1 Cor 16:12](https://ref.ly/1Cor16:12)). The two men had different personalities, gifts, and roles, but God worked through both of them. • Some believers in Ephesus still had an inadequate understanding of the Christian faith (cp. [Acts 18:26](https://ref.ly/Acts18:26)) and did not receive the Holy Spirit when they believed. They had accepted John’s baptism*,* which called for repentance from sin*,* but had not received Christian baptism, which included the gift of the Holy Spirit. When Paul had instructed them further, they were able to receive Christian baptism ([19:5](https://ref.ly/Acts19:5)) and the Holy Spirit ([19:6](https://ref.ly/Acts19:6)).

The commander had mistaken Paul for an Egyptian false messiah who had planned to seize power from the Romans around AD 54 (roughly three years earlier; see Josephus, *War* 2\.13\.5\). Paul corrected the mistake, gained permission to speak to the people, and addressed the crowd in Aramaic, the common language of Judea. He gave a strong statement of his faith in Jesus as the Messiah ([Acts 22:1–21](https://ref.ly/Acts22:1-Acts22:21)).

Paul’s premier defense of his life and faith before his own people in Jerusalem illustrates his flexibility as a missionary, just as his speech to the Greek philosophers in Athens had done ([17:22–31](https://ref.ly/Acts17:22-Acts17:31); see [1 Cor 9:20–23](https://ref.ly/1Cor9:20-1Cor9:23)). Paul begins by recognizing his kinship with his people, explaining his Jewish background and training under the noted rabbi Gamaliel the Elder and describing his zealous desire to honor God in everything*,* which they shared ([Acts 22:1–3](https://ref.ly/Acts22:1-Acts22:3)). Paul then describes his persecution of Christians ([22:4–5](https://ref.ly/Acts22:4-Acts22:5)), the revelation of Jesus to him on the way to Damascus ([22:6–10](https://ref.ly/Acts22:6-Acts22:10)), and his conversion ([22:11–16](https://ref.ly/Acts22:11-Acts22:16)). Paul ends his speech by describing his conversation with the Lord in the Temple. The Lord had predicted the Jews’ rejection of the message and had sent Paul to the Gentiles ([22:17–21](https://ref.ly/Acts22:17-Acts22:21)).

Paul focused on the key issue in his trial, the hope of resurrection from the dead.

Pharisees could not abide the inclusion of the Gentiles apart from circumcision and keeping the law of Moses (cp. [15:5](https://ref.ly/Acts15:5)), but that was what the resurrection of Jesus and the outpouring of the Spirit had provided ([Acts 2:39](https://ref.ly/Acts2:39); [10:34–48](https://ref.ly/Acts10:34-Acts10:48)).

In his eloquent defense before King Agrippa*,* Paul argued that his preaching was completely consistent with the Jewish faith. The defense begins with a courteous acknowledgement of Agrippa’s competence to hear the evidence ([26:2–3](https://ref.ly/Acts26:2-Acts26:3)), outlines the nature of Paul’s background, Jewish training, and membership in the Pharisees ([26:4–5](https://ref.ly/Acts26:4-Acts26:5)), and explains that the charges against him are merely for believing the fulfillment of Jewish hopes for the resurrection ([26:6–8](https://ref.ly/Acts26:6-Acts26:8)). Paul then tells the story of his conversion from strong opponent of Christianity ([26:9–11](https://ref.ly/Acts26:9-Acts26:11)) through a vision on the way to Damascus ([26:12–18](https://ref.ly/Acts26:12-Acts26:18); see [9:1–18](https://ref.ly/Acts9:1-Acts9:18)).

Even though he encountered violent opposition from his fellow Jews ([26:21](https://ref.ly/Acts26:21)), God protected him as he taught a message that the Jews should have embraced ([26:22–23](https://ref.ly/Acts26:22-Acts26:23)). This defense is a model for Christians put on trial for their faith (see [9:15](https://ref.ly/Acts9:15); [Luke 21:12–15](https://ref.ly/Luke21:12-Luke21:15)).

It seems best to take Agrippa’s reply as deliberately evasive: He didn’t want to admit that he believed the prophets ([26:27](https://ref.ly/Acts26:27)), for Paul had just made a strong case, and the next step would be to believe in Jesus as the promised Messiah to whom the prophets pointed. Agrippa didn’t want to take that step. On the other hand, he didn’t want to say that he didn’t believe the prophets, for that would alienate the Jewish subjects to whose loyalties he wanted to appeal. His non\-committal response underlines his discomfort with Paul’s testimony.

Despite being under house arrest ([28:16](https://ref.ly/Acts28:16)), Paul boldly proclaimed the Kingdom message. • And no one tried to stop him (Greek akōlutōs, “without hindrance”): This single word in Greek is the last word of the book of Acts and one of the keys to its meaning: God’s word cannot be chained, even when its messengers are ([2 Tim 2:9](https://ref.ly/2Tim2:9); see [Phil 1:12–14](https://ref.ly/Phil1:12-Phil1:14)). Acts is the story of an unhindered message of Good News, available to all people throughout the world, whether Jew, Gentile, proselyte, rich, or poor. The mission of proclaiming this message is accomplished in the power of the Spirit ([Acts 1:8](https://ref.ly/Acts1:8)); it embraces Jews ([3:1–5:42](https://ref.ly/Acts3:1-Acts5:42)), Samaritans ([8:1–25](https://ref.ly/Acts8:1-Acts8:25)), converts to Judaism ([2:11](https://ref.ly/Acts2:11); [13:43](https://ref.ly/Acts13:43)), “God\-fearers” ([8:26–40](https://ref.ly/Acts8:26-Acts8:40); [9:32–11:18](https://ref.ly/Acts9:32-Acts11:18)), and Gentiles ([13:1–28:28](https://ref.ly/Acts13:1-Acts28:28)). • Luke ends his account with Paul still under house arrest in Rome (about AD 60–62\). Paul was later released and traveled freely. According to tradition, Paul was imprisoned again in Rome about AD 64 and was martyred there during Nero’s persecution of believers.
