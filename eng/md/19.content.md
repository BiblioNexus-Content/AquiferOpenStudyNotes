## Psalms 1:1 (id: 23652)

* *Blessed*: The Hebrew term (*’ashrey*) appears twenty\-six times in Psalms. While some translations use “blessed,” a different term (*barak*) is used for blessings ([Psalms 5:12](https://ref.ly/Ps5:12); [45:2](https://ref.ly/Ps45:2); [107:38](https://ref.ly/Ps107:38)).
* The godly avoid living under the influence of sinners. Those who do not fear the Lord are wicked ([Psalm 36:1](https://ref.ly/Ps36:1)). They oppose those who love God, do right, and the poor and oppressed (see [10:2–13](https://ref.ly/Ps10:2-Ps10:13); [37:14](https://ref.ly/Ps37:14)). The wicked might seem devoted to God ([50:16](https://ref.ly/Ps50:16)). Sometimes they enjoy success, but it does not last long ([37:35](https://ref.ly/Ps37:35)). They will face sadness and ruin when they must deal with the results of their bad actions ([1:4–6](https://ref.ly/Ps1:4-Ps1:6); [9:16](https://ref.ly/Ps9:16); [32:10](https://ref.ly/Ps32:10)).
* People who turn away from God's path and rebel against him are sinners ([Psalms 25:8](https://ref.ly/Ps25:8); [78:17](https://ref.ly/Ps78:17)). They commit serious crimes like adultery (being unfaithful to their spouse) and murder (compare [Psalm 51](https://ref.ly/Ps51:1-Ps51:19)).
* *sit in the seat of*: This expression describes a person who is controlled by sin (compare [Psalm 1:2](https://ref.ly/Ps1:2); [26:3–7](https://ref.ly/Ps26:3-Ps26:7); [Deuteronomy 6:7](https://ref.ly/Deut6:7)).
* Mockers are people who disrespect and reject God's wisdom. Mockers hate the Lord and insult anyone who tries to correct them ([Proverbs 9:7–8](https://ref.ly/Prov9:7-Prov9:8)). They seek only the “wisdom” that justifies their actions. These bold people have little respect for God, his plans, or his followers (see [Psalms 86:14](https://ref.ly/Ps86:14); [119:51](https://ref.ly/Ps119:51), [69](https://ref.ly/Ps119:69), [78](https://ref.ly/Ps119:78), [85](https://ref.ly/Ps119:85), [122](https://ref.ly/Ps119:122)). These three terms (wicked, sinners, mockers) describe all kinds of people who do not live in a way that pleases God.

## Psalms 1:1–2 (id: 23649)

The Lord brings true happiness to those who turn away from evil and find joy in him.

* **Associated Passages:** PSA 1:1–PSA 1:2

## Psalms 1:1–6 (id: 23650)

This wisdom psalm sets the tone for the whole Psalter. The psalmist strongly contrasts the happiness of the godly with the condemnation of the wicked; in the end, the way of wisdom will triumph. This idealization of the godly person (as in [Ps 8](https://ref.ly/Ps8:1-Ps8:9)) highlights the Lord’s expectations of his people and especially of the coming Messiah ([Ps 2](https://ref.ly/Ps2:1-Ps2:12)). The people of Israel did not live up to this ideal, and neither did the kings of David’s dynasty. Not even the best of them could bring in the triumph of righteousness described in [Psalms 1](https://ref.ly/Ps1:1-Ps1:6), [2](https://ref.ly/Ps2:1-Ps2:12), [and 72](https://ref.ly/Ps72:1-Ps72:20). In the New Testament, the apostles’ use of the Psalter to describe the life and ministry of Jesus the Messiah confirms that Jesus alone fulfills the ideal of the godly person presented in the psalms. Only Jesus could please God and secure redemption, happiness, and peace. [Psalm 1](https://ref.ly/Ps1:1-Ps1:6) introduces the hopeful anticipation of the final hallelujah ([Ps 150](https://ref.ly/Ps150:1-Ps150:6)), when the Lord will remove all evil from his creation and prosper his children.

* **Associated Passages:** PSA 1:1–PSA 1:6

## Psalms 1:1–2.12 (id: 23648)

The first two psalms serve as an introduction to the whole book of Psalms (called the Psalter). [Psalm 1](https://ref.ly/Ps1:1-Ps1:6) presents the Lord's guidance in wisdom, while [Psalm 2](https://ref.ly/Ps2:1-Ps2:12) shows God's rule over a rebellious and sinful world. Together, these psalms invite people to abandon foolishness, which leads to destruction. These psalms invite people to follow God's path instead, which leads to wisdom and salvation. The New Testament confirms that God will govern the nations through Jesus Christ, his chosen representative ([Hebrews 1:5](https://ref.ly/Heb1:5); [Revelation 12:5](https://ref.ly/Rev12:5); [19:15](https://ref.ly/Rev19:15)).

* **Associated Passages:** PSA 1:1–PSA 2:12

## Psalms 1:1–8.9 (id: 23651)

[Psalms 1](https://ref.ly/Ps1:1-Ps1:6) and [8](https://ref.ly/Ps8:1-Ps8:9) form an *inclusio* (set of literary bookends) that describes what God expects of the ideal person (cp. [Pss 19](https://ref.ly/Ps19:1-Ps19:14); [33](https://ref.ly/Ps33:1-Ps33:22); [104](https://ref.ly/Ps104:1-Ps104:35); [145](https://ref.ly/Ps145:1-Ps145:21)), contrasts the godly person with the wicked, and extols the godly person’s dignity. Jesus the Messiah ([Ps 2](https://ref.ly/Ps2:1-Ps2:12))—the sovereign Lord ([Heb 2:6–8](https://ref.ly/Heb2:6-Heb2:8); see [1 Cor 15:27](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:27)) and perfection of humanity—embodies this ideal.

* **Associated Passages:** PSA 1:1

## Psalms 1:2 (id: 23653)

The law (Hebrew torah) of the Lord is the full revelation of God’s instructions (see study note on Deut 4:44). • Meditating is a process of inner reflection that can be positive ([Pss 1:2](https://ref.ly/Ps1:2); [63:6](https://ref.ly/Ps63:6); [77:12](https://ref.ly/Ps77:12); [143:5](https://ref.ly/Ps143:5)) or negative (see [2:1](https://ref.ly/Ps2:1); [38:12](https://ref.ly/Ps38:12)). The Lord’s word is the object of godly meditation ([119:48](https://ref.ly/Ps119:48)). • Day and night includes all times, whether one is walking, standing, sitting, or sleeping (see [Deut 6:7](https://ref.ly/Deut6:7)).

## Psalms 1:3 (id: 23655)

* **Associated Passages:** PSA 1:3

## Psalms 1:3–5 (id: 23654)

The future belongs to the godly.

* **Associated Passages:** PSA 1:3–PSA 1:5

## Psalms 1:4 (id: 23656)

The coming time of judgment ([1:5](https://ref.ly/Ps1:5)) will carry off the wicked and their deeds ([35:5](https://ref.ly/Ps35:5); [83:13](https://ref.ly/Ps83:13); [Isa 17:13](https://ref.ly/Isa17:13); see study note on Jer 13:24).

* **Associated Passages:** PSA 1:4
* **Associated Articles:** Jeremiah 13:24 (ID: `17544@TyndaleStudyNotes`)

## Psalms 1:5 (id: 23657)

The wicked cannot abide the scrutiny of the Lord’s judgment*;* they are already condemned (see [5:5](https://ref.ly/Ps5:5); [7:6](https://ref.ly/Ps7:6); [101:7](https://ref.ly/Ps101:7)).

* **Associated Passages:** PSA 1:5

## Psalms 1:6 (id: 23658)

* When God takes care of people who obey him and punishes people who do evil, it shows how God gives people what their actions deserve (see [Galatians 6:7–10](https://ref.ly/Gal6:7-Gal6:10)). This is called "retribution." The wicked might appear successful for a short while, but their lives are short and meaningless in the end. God and the people who remain faithful to him will have the final victory (see [Psalms 9:5](https://ref.ly/Ps9:5), [6](https://ref.ly/Ps9:6), [18](https://ref.ly/Ps9:18); [10:16](https://ref.ly/Ps10:16); [37:20](https://ref.ly/Ps37:20); [73:27](https://ref.ly/Ps73:27); [92:9](https://ref.ly/Ps92:9); compare [142:4](https://ref.ly/Ps142:4); [Isaiah 57:1](https://ref.ly/Isa57:1)).
* People who live in a way that pleases God are happy ([Psalms 1:1](https://ref.ly/Ps1:1); [5:12](https://ref.ly/Ps5:12); [14:5](https://ref.ly/Ps14:5)). They are happy because God protects and cares for them, listens when they ask for justice, and secures their future (see [121:3–4](https://ref.ly/Ps121:3-Ps121:4)).
* A person's path is their life and character.

* **Associated Passages:** PSA 1:6

## Psalms 2:1 (id: 24224)

*plot*: The Hebrew verb translated as "meditates" in [Psalm 1:2](https://ref.ly/Ps1:2) suggests opposing the Lord through speech ([Isaiah 59:13](https://ref.ly/Isa59:13)) or thought ([Psalm 38:12](https://ref.ly/Ps38:12); [Proverbs 24:2](https://ref.ly/Prov24:2)).

* **Associated Passages:** PSA 2:1

## Psalms 2:1–3 (id: 24221)

Their futile paths lead to death ([1:4](https://ref.ly/Ps1:4), [6](https://ref.ly/Ps1:6)), but fallen human beings unite in opposing the true God and his Messiah.

* **Associated Passages:** PSA 2:1–PSA 2:3

## Psalms 2:1–12 (id: 24220)

This royal psalm pertains to the Lord’s appointment of a king descended from David. It celebrates the mission of all the kings in David’s line, and it introduces the hope of an ideal ruler who will accomplish the Lord’s goal of bringing all nations into submission ([2:11](https://ref.ly/Ps2:11)) or to destruction ([2:9](https://ref.ly/Ps2:9)). The New Testament identifies Jesus as this descendant (see [Acts 13:33](https://ref.ly/Acts13:33); [1 Cor 15:25–27](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:25-1Cor15:27); [Heb 1:5](https://ref.ly/Heb1:5); [5:5](https://ref.ly/Heb5:5); [Rev 19:15](https://ref.ly/Rev19:15)).

* **Associated Passages:** PSA 2:1–PSA 2:12

## Psalms 2:2 (id: 24225)

The kings hate the Lord’s established order in the world, so they desire to be independent of him (see [36:4](https://ref.ly/Ps36:4)). They scheme about dominating the Lord’s people ([31:13](https://ref.ly/Ps31:13); see [83:1–4](https://ref.ly/Ps83:1-Ps83:4)). Their goal is to subvert the Lord’s rule in the world by overthrowing his anointed one (or *his messiah*); the Lord chose the kings of David’s dynasty to establish his kingdom throughout the earth. The New Testament confirms that Jesus, the appointed and anointed Son of God ([Acts 4:26](https://ref.ly/Acts4:26); [13:33](https://ref.ly/Acts13:33); [Heb 1:5](https://ref.ly/Heb1:5); [5:5](https://ref.ly/Heb5:5)), fulfills the role in which these earlier kings failed.

* **Associated Passages:** PSA 2:2

## Psalms 2:3 (id: 24226)

break their chains: These kings believe that acknowledging the true God and his chosen ruler will result in their enslavement ([Isa 28:22](https://ref.ly/Isa28:22); [52:2](https://ref.ly/Isa52:2); cp. [Lam 3:7](https://ref.ly/Lam3:7); [Rom 1:1](https://ref.ly/Rom1:1); [1 Cor 7:22](https://ref.ly/1Cor7:22); [Titus 1:1](https://ref.ly/Titus1:1)).

* **Associated Passages:** PSA 2:3

## Psalms 2:4 (id: 24228)

rules in heaven: The Lord’s place in the universe is so certain that he scoffs at humans who boast that they can rebel against his power and authority (see [37:13](https://ref.ly/Ps37:13); [59:8](https://ref.ly/Ps59:8)).

* **Associated Passages:** PSA 2:4

## Psalms 2:4–6 (id: 24227)

The Lord finds the human threat insignificant. He provided a solution long before their rebellion. He will end their agitation through the appointment of a human agent, a descendant of David’s line who will rule the nations.

* **Associated Passages:** PSA 2:4–PSA 2:6

## Psalms 2:6 (id: 24229)

my chosen king: The Lord establishes his anointed ruler.

* **Associated Passages:** PSA 2:6

## Psalms 2:7 (id: 24231)

Today I have become your Father: People in the ancient Near East commonly accepted a father\-son relationship between gods and kings. In Israel, the Lord adopted kings as his sons. God set David apart as his most excellent and exalted son ([89:27](https://ref.ly/Ps89:27)). All descendants of David were the Lord’s representatives or agents. As an eternal member of the Godhead ([John 1:1](https://ref.ly/John1:1)) and a descendant of David ([Acts 13:33](https://ref.ly/Acts13:33); [Heb 1:5](https://ref.ly/Heb1:5); [5:5](https://ref.ly/Heb5:5)), Jesus is the true Son of God.

* **Associated Passages:** PSA 2:7

## Psalms 2:7–9 (id: 24230)

The Lord adopted the king of David’s dynasty to conquer rebellious nations by force (see [89:26–27](https://ref.ly/Ps89:26-Ps89:27)).

* **Associated Passages:** PSA 2:7–PSA 2:9

## Psalms 2:8 (id: 24232)

In an example of the suzerain\-vassal relationship between the Lord and Israel’s king (see Deuteronomy Book Introduction, “Literary Form”), the Lord invites the king to ask for favors (see [Ps 21:2](https://ref.ly/Ps21:2), [4](https://ref.ly/Ps21:4)). • All nations will be subject to David’s descendant, the Messiah.

* **Associated Passages:** PSA 2:8

## Psalms 2:9 (id: 24233)

The Lord gives his anointed ruler the power to conquer the nations as his inheritance ([Isa 11:4](https://ref.ly/Isa11:4); [Rev 2:27](https://ref.ly/Rev2:27); [12:5](https://ref.ly/Rev12:5); [19:15](https://ref.ly/Rev19:15)), breaking their rebellion, resistance, and independence.

* **Associated Passages:** PSA 2:9

## Psalms 2:10 (id: 24222)

It pleases the Lord when his people submit to him and seek his protection. The wise accept the Lord’s rebuke and desire to repent.

* **Associated Passages:** PSA 2:10

## Psalms 2:11–12 (id: 24223)

rejoice: Rulers must welcome the Son as their true and only King. • Submit to God’s royal son (or *Submit to God’s royal Son,* or *kiss the son*): Kissing was an expression of submission ([Hos 13:2](https://ref.ly/Hos13:2)). • The Lord gives joy to all who fear him ([Ps 1:1–2](https://ref.ly/Ps1:1-Ps1:2)) and trust him ([18:30](https://ref.ly/Ps18:30); [34:22](https://ref.ly/Ps34:22); [119:1–3](https://ref.ly/Ps119:1-Ps119:3)).

## Psalms 3:1 (id: 24357)

title

This sad episode in David’s life (see [2 Sam 15–18](https://ref.ly/2Sam15:1-2Sam18:33)) helps readers keep the promises of [Ps 2](https://ref.ly/Ps2:1-Ps2:12) in perspective. The Lord granted victory to his anointed king ([Ps 2](https://ref.ly/Ps2:1-Ps2:12)), but the manner and timing of this victory remained in God’s hands.

## Psalms 3:1–2 (id: 24354)

The psalmist’s many enemies speak brashly ([4:6](https://ref.ly/Ps4:6); [12:4](https://ref.ly/Ps12:4); [40:15](https://ref.ly/Ps40:15)) and question the Lord’s ability to rescue ([10:11](https://ref.ly/Ps10:11); [22:7–8](https://ref.ly/Ps22:7-Ps22:8); [71:10](https://ref.ly/Ps71:10)). Their words haunt him because it seems that the Lord will not answer his prayer. • These enemies wield great power (cp. [2:1–3](https://ref.ly/Ps2:1-Ps2:3)); unlike [Ps 2](https://ref.ly/Ps2:1-Ps2:12), this psalm does not resolve the crisis.

* **Associated Passages:** PSA 3:1–PSA 3:2

## Psalms 3:1–8 (id: 24356)

This psalm laments that the expectations raised by [Pss 1–2](https://ref.ly/Ps1:1-Ps2:12) have not been met. But even when beset by enemies, godly people need not question the Lord’s just dealings. Rather, they can confidently trust his goodness and expect God to rescue them.

* **Associated Passages:** PSA 3:1–PSA 3:8

## Psalms 3:1–7.17 (id: 24355)

This group of psalms moves readers from the orderly world of [Pss 1–2](https://ref.ly/Ps1:1-Ps2:12) to a disoriented one. The Lord’s anointed cries out while facing enemies, ferocious opposition, evil schemes, and the Lord’s apparent distance.

* **Associated Passages:** PSA 3:1–PSA 7:17

## Psalms 3:3 (id: 24359)

By refocusing on the Lord ([3:3–4](https://ref.ly/Ps3:3-Ps3:4)) in the midst of his crisis, the psalmist can rest, confident of his safety (see study note on 4:8). The Lord cares for his servant; he protects him and keeps his mind and heart from fear ([37:17](https://ref.ly/Ps37:17); [54:4](https://ref.ly/Ps54:4); [119:116](https://ref.ly/Ps119:116); [145:14](https://ref.ly/Ps145:14)).

## Psalms 4:4 (id: 24498)

Angry feelings are not sinful, but letting anger control you leads to sin (see [37:7–8](https://ref.ly/Ps37:7-Ps37:8); cp. [Eph 4:26–27](https://ref.ly/Eph4:26-Eph4:27), [31–32](https://ref.ly/Eph4:31-Eph4:32)). • Instead of acting on their emotions, the godly think about their circumstances overnight. They might be disturbed as they sleep, but silence opens their hearts to trust in the Lord ([Ps 4:5](https://ref.ly/Ps4:5)).

* **Associated Passages:** PSA 4:4

## Psalms 4:5 (id: 24499)

Offer sacrifices in the right spirit: Redirecting emotions toward the Lord prevents a godly individual from doing too much self\-reflection ([40:6–8](https://ref.ly/Ps40:6-Ps40:8); [51:17](https://ref.ly/Ps51:17)).

* **Associated Passages:** PSA 4:5

your face (or *the light of your face*): The psalmist seeks God’s favor and peace ([Num 6:25–26](https://ref.ly/Num6:25-Num6:26)), which can transform darkness into light (see [Ps 27:1](https://ref.ly/Ps27:1)).

## Psalms 5:1–12 (id: 24587)

This morning prayer ([5:3](https://ref.ly/Ps5:3)) expresses unwavering confidence in the Lord’s help and protection. The psalmist asks for and awaits God’s response ([5:1–3](https://ref.ly/Ps5:1-Ps5:3)). He describes the schemes of the wicked in detail but does not get lost in his circumstances. The psalmist also knows that the wicked cannot coexist with God ([5:4–6](https://ref.ly/Ps5:4-Ps5:6), [9](https://ref.ly/Ps5:9); see [1:5](https://ref.ly/Ps1:5)). He keeps returning to the Lord ([5:7–8](https://ref.ly/Ps5:7-Ps5:8), [10](https://ref.ly/Ps5:10); see [5:1–3](https://ref.ly/Ps5:1-Ps5:3)), and then he prays for the godly community ([5:10–12](https://ref.ly/Ps5:10-Ps5:12); see [3:8](https://ref.ly/Ps3:8)).

The Lord (Hebrew Yahweh), the covenant God of Israel ([Exod 3:15](https://ref.ly/Exod3:15)), also holds the title of Lord (Hebrew ’adonay), the king of the earth. • The word translated majestic (sometimes translated “mighty”) can describe kings ([Ps 136:18](https://ref.ly/Ps136:18)), heroes ([16:3](https://ref.ly/Ps16:3)), mountains ([76:4](https://ref.ly/Ps76:4)), or waves breaking on the seashore ([93:4](https://ref.ly/Ps93:4)).

Instead of the world of enemies, wicked people, and unfair justice shown in [Psalms 3–7](https://ref.ly/Ps3:1-Ps7:17), this psalm presents the world as God first made it.

All previous laments pale in comparison with this outcry against the enemy and God’s abandonment. The psalm contains two main sections: the lament ([22:1–21](https://ref.ly/Ps22:1-Ps22:21)) and praise for redemption ([22:22–31](https://ref.ly/Ps22:22-Ps22:31)), which leads naturally to [Ps 23](https://ref.ly/Ps23:1-Ps23:6). The apostles saw in this psalm an expression of the sufferings of Jesus Christ, who ultimately fulfilled the purpose of David’s humiliation, rejection by people, and divine abandonment ([Matt 27:35](https://ref.ly/Matt27:35), [39](https://ref.ly/Matt27:39), [43](https://ref.ly/Matt27:43), [46](https://ref.ly/Matt27:46); [Mark 15:34](https://ref.ly/Mark15:34); [John 19:23–24](https://ref.ly/John19:23-John19:24), [28](https://ref.ly/John19:28); [Heb 2:12](https://ref.ly/Heb2:12)).

I can count all my bones: The psalmist’s enemies have utterly shamed him by taking his garments.

Sin can lead to sickness and even death ([1 Cor 11:30](https://ref.ly/1Cor11:30)).

Asking the Lord to act quickly in times of great need is common in the Psalter ([22:19](https://ref.ly/Ps22:19); [31:2](https://ref.ly/Ps31:2); [40:13](https://ref.ly/Ps40:13); [69:17](https://ref.ly/Ps69:17); [70:1](https://ref.ly/Ps70:1); [71:12](https://ref.ly/Ps71:12); [79:8](https://ref.ly/Ps79:8); [102:2](https://ref.ly/Ps102:2); [141:1](https://ref.ly/Ps141:1); [143:7](https://ref.ly/Ps143:7)).

The human lifetime is but a moment to God ([90:4](https://ref.ly/Ps90:4)), as temporary as a breath (see [39:11](https://ref.ly/Ps39:11); [144:4](https://ref.ly/Ps144:4)).

He had expected a wicked life to have those qualities (see [Pss 37:2](https://ref.ly/Ps37:2), [20](https://ref.ly/Ps37:20); [103:15–16](https://ref.ly/Ps103:15-Ps103:16)), but now whether a person is godly or not seems to be irrelevant.

The Lord delights in the attitude and character of the person making an offering more than in the offering itself. • Now that you have made me listen, I finally understand: Greek text reads *You have given me a body.* In [Heb 10:5–7](https://ref.ly/Heb10:5-Heb10:7), the writer quotes from the Greek version of [Ps 40:6–8](https://ref.ly/Ps40:6-Ps40:8).

## Psalms 41:4 (id: 24513)

The psalmist applies the blessing to himself ([41:12](https://ref.ly/Ps41:12)). Apparently he has taken care of the poor ([41:1](https://ref.ly/Ps41:1)), but he has sinned against the Lord in other ways. Out of his pain, he cries for healing while confessing his sin. The Lord alone can grant the restoration that brings true joy ([30:2](https://ref.ly/Ps30:2); [107:20–21](https://ref.ly/Ps107:20-Ps107:21)).

The psalmist’s longing for God comes from being geographically distant from the Temple as he remembers the past. • The verb translated longs is found only here and in [Joel 1:20](https://ref.ly/Joel1:20) (“cry out”); in both cases it refers to extreme thirst in a waterless desert (see [Pss 63:1](https://ref.ly/Ps63:1); [143:6](https://ref.ly/Ps143:6); see also [84:2](https://ref.ly/Ps84:2)).

These psalms, like [Pss 9](https://ref.ly/Ps9:1-Ps9:20) and[10](https://ref.ly/Ps10:1-Ps10:18), form a unit comprising a lament with a bittersweet refrain of hope ([42:5](https://ref.ly/Ps42:5), [11](https://ref.ly/Ps42:11); [43:5](https://ref.ly/Ps43:5)). In many Hebrew manuscripts these two psalms are combined as one. The historical context is uncertain; these psalms might be the voice of God’s people in exile, confessing their loyalty to God as he punishes them for their prevailing apostasy. The psalmist longs for fellowship with God such as he enjoyed in Jerusalem ([42:4](https://ref.ly/Ps42:4)); his memories only make him more discouraged. As the psalmist cries out to God, he recalls God’s love and faithfulness ([42:8](https://ref.ly/Ps42:8)), which moves him to plead for vindication ([43:1–4](https://ref.ly/Ps43:1-Ps43:4)).

The Israelite community in exile confessed the Lord’s goodness and justice and their own historic sinfulness. From the humble state of exile, they pleaded for redemption and restoration, asking to be gathered back from all the places the Lord had scattered them in his wrath.

Israel failed, but the Lord is constant. • Verses 1, [47–48](https://ref.ly/Ps47:1-Ps48:14) (along with [Pss 96](https://ref.ly/Ps96:1-Ps96:13); [105:1–15](https://ref.ly/Ps105:1-Ps105:15)) are included in David’s song of praise recorded in [1 Chr 16:1–43](https://ref.ly/1Chr16:1-1Chr16:43).

The king of Israel had the great privilege of being the Lord’s adopted son ([Ps 2](https://ref.ly/Ps2:1-Ps2:12); [1 Chr 22:10](https://ref.ly/1Chr22:10)), but he fell ([Ps 89](https://ref.ly/Ps89:1-Ps89:52)).

The New Testament frequently cites this psalm to validate Jesus’ claim to be the Messiah ([Matt 22:44–45](https://ref.ly/Matt22:44-Matt22:45); [Mark 12:36–37](https://ref.ly/Mark12:36-Mark12:37); [Luke 20:42–44](https://ref.ly/Luke20:42-Luke20:44); [Acts 2:34–35](https://ref.ly/Acts2:34-Acts2:35); [Heb 1:13](https://ref.ly/Heb1:13)). • The Lord’s right hand represents his authority, strength, presence, and benefits. The Lord chose the descendant of David and raised him up to be close to him ([Ps 80:17](https://ref.ly/Ps80:17)). Jesus claimed this position for himself ([Matt 26:64](https://ref.ly/Matt26:64); [Mark 14:62](https://ref.ly/Mark14:62); [16:19](https://ref.ly/Mark16:19); [Luke 22:69](https://ref.ly/Luke22:69)), and the apostles announced that Jesus, having ascended to heaven, sits at the right hand of the Father ([Acts 2:33](https://ref.ly/Acts2:33); [5:31](https://ref.ly/Acts5:31); [7:55–56](https://ref.ly/Acts7:55-Acts7:56); [Rom 8:34](https://ref.ly/Rom8:34); [Eph 1:20](https://ref.ly/Eph1:20); [Col 3:1](https://ref.ly/Col3:1); [Heb 1:3](https://ref.ly/Heb1:3); [8:1](https://ref.ly/Heb8:1); [10:12](https://ref.ly/Heb10:12); [12:2](https://ref.ly/Heb12:2)). • Ancient Near Eastern kings were sometimes portrayed as placing their feet on the backs of their conquered enemies as on a footstool (see [Heb 10:12–13](https://ref.ly/Heb10:12-Heb10:13)).

The Lord had made an unbreakable oath and covenant, so his apparent rejection of David’s dynasty ([89:38](https://ref.ly/Ps89:38)) in the Exile had led to a crisis. The placement of [Ps 110](https://ref.ly/Ps110:1-Ps110:7) in Book Five reaffirms the future of the dynasty: David’s descendant must conform to God’s standard of integrity ([Ps 101](https://ref.ly/Ps101:1-Ps101:8)). His ministry will be transformed as he serves under God’s kingship ([Pss 93–100](https://ref.ly/Ps93:1-Ps100:5)). • You are a priest forever: The role of God’s messianic ruler changes. The priestly kingship of David and his descendants extended to serving as patrons of the Temple. David had the Ark brought to Jerusalem ([2 Sam 6:15](https://ref.ly/2Sam6:15)) and arranged for the Temple service ([1 Chr 6:31–48](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:31-1Chr6:48); [15:11–26](https://ref.ly/1Chr15:11-1Chr15:26); [16:4–42](https://ref.ly/1Chr16:4-1Chr16:42); [23:4–32](https://ref.ly/1Chr23:4-1Chr23:32); [25:1](https://ref.ly/1Chr25:1)). Solomon supervised the Temple construction ([1 Kgs 5:1–7:51](https://ref.ly/1Kgs5:1-1Kgs7:51)). Even so, Israel’s kingship was separate from its priesthood. In the messianic kingdom, the king would also minister as priest, as Melchizedek*,* king of Salem ([Gen 14:18](https://ref.ly/Gen14:18)), had done. The New Testament develops the ministry of Jesus Christ as a fulfillment of this new order (see [Heb 5:6–10](https://ref.ly/Heb5:6-Heb5:10); [6:20–7:25](https://ref.ly/Heb6:20-Heb7:25)).

This is the last of the Great Hallel psalms ([Pss 120–136](https://ref.ly/Ps120:1-Ps136:26)). It distinctively repeats the refrain His faithful love endures forever in every verse. The hymn is framed by a call to praise ([136:1–3](https://ref.ly/Ps136:1-Ps136:3), [26](https://ref.ly/Ps136:26)). It proclaims the Lord as the Creator of all and the Redeemer of Israel, both in the distant ([136:10–22](https://ref.ly/Ps136:10-Ps136:22)) and in the recent past ([136:23–24](https://ref.ly/Ps136:23-Ps136:24)).

The phrase God of heaven is an exilic and postexilic designation for the Lord; it is found in Ezra ([Ezra 1:2](https://ref.ly/Ezra1:2); [5:11](https://ref.ly/Ezra5:11), [12](https://ref.ly/Ezra5:12); [6:9](https://ref.ly/Ezra6:9), [10](https://ref.ly/Ezra6:10); [7:12](https://ref.ly/Ezra7:12); etc.), Nehemiah ([Neh 1:5](https://ref.ly/Neh1:5); [2:4](https://ref.ly/Neh2:4), [20](https://ref.ly/Neh2:20); etc.), and Daniel ([Dan 2:18](https://ref.ly/Dan2:18), [19](https://ref.ly/Dan2:19), [37](https://ref.ly/Dan2:37), [44](https://ref.ly/Dan2:44)).

## Psalms 137:1–9 (id: 24058)

In response to the pain of exile ([137:1–4](https://ref.ly/Ps137:1-Ps137:4)), the psalmist resolves to remember Jerusalem even though the memories cause him pain ([137:4–6](https://ref.ly/Ps137:4-Ps137:6)).

* **Associated Passages:** PSA 137:1–PSA 137:9

## Psalms 137:2–4 (id: 24059)

Because the music of Jerusalem was tied to the joys of life in the Promised Land, the Exile removed any occasion for singing joyous songs. The Babylonians wanted the Judeans to sing and dance for them, but the exiles’ grief made doing so either distasteful or impossible. The songs celebrating the Lord speak of his power and goodness, but his people were filled with doubts and questions. They hung their harps in trees, perhaps signifying the death of their joy under God’s curse ([Deut 21:23](https://ref.ly/Deut21:23)).

The poet witnessed the betrayal of God’s people from Judah by the Edomites*,* so he curses Edom.

* **Associated Passages:** PSA 139:1–PSA 139:6

## Psalms 139:1–24 (id: 24069)

In this wisdom psalm, the psalmist opens every aspect of his being, character, behavior, and speech to God’s examination. As hard as life is, he wants to ensure his own growth in wisdom so that he does not come under God’s judgment of the wicked ([141:5](https://ref.ly/Ps141:5); [142:3](https://ref.ly/Ps142:3); [143:8](https://ref.ly/Ps143:8), [10](https://ref.ly/Ps143:10); [144:3–4](https://ref.ly/Ps144:3-Ps144:4)). Further, the poet recognizes that he cannot escape from the Lord. His sense of stress disappears when he considers the Lord’s loving care for him, even before birth ([139:13–18](https://ref.ly/Ps139:13-Ps139:18)). He then invites the Lord to continue examining him as he walks in the path of wisdom ([139:23–24](https://ref.ly/Ps139:23-Ps139:24)).
