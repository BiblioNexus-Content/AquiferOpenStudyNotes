## John 1:1 (id: 18794)

Echoing [Gen 1:1](https://ref.ly/Gen1:1), John’s Gospel introduces Jesus Christ, through whom God created everything ([John 1:3](https://ref.ly/John1:3)); Jesus also creates new life in those who believe ([1:12–13](https://ref.ly/John1:12-John1:13)). The Gospel opens with its central affirmation, that Jesus Christ, the Word (Greek logos), not only revealed God but was God*.* In Greek thought, the logos was the rational principle guiding the universe and making life coherent. For Jewish people, the logos was the word of the Lord, an expression of God’s wisdom and creative power. By Jesus’ time, the logos was viewed as coming from God and having his personality (see [Ps 33:6](https://ref.ly/Ps33:6), [9](https://ref.ly/Ps33:9); [Prov 8:22–31](https://ref.ly/Prov8:22-Prov8:31)); John affirmed this understanding ([John 1:14](https://ref.ly/John1:14)).

## John 1:1–18 (id: 18784)

The beginning of this prologue ([1:1–5](https://ref.ly/John1:1-John1:5)) might be a poem or hymn sung by the earliest Christians. The prologue’s themes—the coming of the light into the world, the rejection of the light, and its gift of new life to believers—prepares readers for the story that follows.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 1:1–JHN 1:18

## John 1:3 (id: 18805)

The logos is God ([1:1–2](https://ref.ly/John1:1-John1:2)); all that God does, the logos likewise does. Throughout his Gospel, John rightly viewed Jesus’ actions as divine activity.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 1:3

## John 1:4 (id: 18813)

The Word gave life: Life was God’s original gift to his creatures ([Gen 1:20–28](https://ref.ly/Gen1:20-Gen1:28); [2:7](https://ref.ly/Gen2:7)). Now the logos would give these creatures the possibility of new life through rebirth ([John 1:13](https://ref.ly/John1:13)). • As one of his first creative acts, God brought light ([Gen 1:3](https://ref.ly/Gen1:3)). Now, in the re\-creation of humanity through Jesus Christ, God offered light and life anew. Light is a key theme in John’s Gospel.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 1:4

## John 1:4–5 (id: 18806)

God created light and dispelled the darkness ([Gen 1:2–5](https://ref.ly/Gen1:2-Gen1:5)). The darkness resists God ([John 3:19–21](https://ref.ly/John3:19-John3:21); [12:35](https://ref.ly/John12:35); [Matt 6:23](https://ref.ly/Matt6:23); [Acts 26:17–18](https://ref.ly/Acts26:17-Acts26:18); [Eph 4:17–19](https://ref.ly/Eph4:17-Eph4:19); [5:7–14](https://ref.ly/Eph5:7-Eph5:14); [2 Pet 1:19](https://ref.ly/2Pet1:19); [1 Jn 1:5–7](https://ref.ly/1John1:5-1John1:7); [2:9–11](https://ref.ly/1John2:9-1John2:11)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 1:4–JHN 1:5

## John 1:5 (id: 18815)

the darkness can never extinguish it: Or *the darkness has not understood it;* literally *the darkness cannot grasp it.* The Greek word katalambanō (“grasp”) can mean either “understand” or “be hostile”; in John’s Gospel, it means hostility. The darkness would try to destroy Jesus (the light), but it would fail. The light would successfully bring salvation to the world.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 1:5

## John 1:6–9 (id: 18816)

God sent a man, John the Baptist, to herald Jesus’ coming and to prepare God’s people to receive Jesus as God’s Son and Messiah (see [1:19–37](https://ref.ly/John1:19-John1:37); [Luke 1:5–25](https://ref.ly/Luke1:5-Luke1:25), [57–80](https://ref.ly/Luke1:57-Luke1:80); [3:1–22](https://ref.ly/Luke3:1-Luke3:22); see also [Isa 40:3](https://ref.ly/Isa40:3); [Mal 4:5–6](https://ref.ly/Mal4:5-Mal4:6)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 1:6–JHN 1:9

## John 1:8 (id: 18817)

Some Jews speculated that John the Baptist was the Messiah; some of his followers were even reluctant to follow Jesus ([3:22–30](https://ref.ly/John3:22-John3:30)). However, John the Baptist was not the light*;* his role was to announce Jesus ([1:19–34](https://ref.ly/John1:19-John1:34)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 1:8

## John 1:10 (id: 18785)

The world cannot recognize the true light even when it encounters its Creator. The world lives in rebellion, loving darkness more than light ([3:19](https://ref.ly/John3:19)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 1:10

## John 1:12 (id: 18786)

Only through divine renewal can people follow the light and enter God’s family ([3:1–17](https://ref.ly/John3:1-John3:17)). • Individuals must believe in Christ to become children of God ([12:35–36](https://ref.ly/John12:35-John12:36)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 1:12

## John 1:13 (id: 18787)

a birth that comes from God: People can escape the darkness only by God’s grace ([8:12](https://ref.ly/John8:12); [12:35–36](https://ref.ly/John12:35-John12:36), [44–46](https://ref.ly/John12:44-John12:46)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 1:13

## John 1:14 (id: 18788)

The idea that the Word became human (literally *became flesh*) stunned both Greeks and Jews. Greeks separated the sphere of God from the mundane world of humanity, which they called *flesh* (Greek sarx). John wrote that God himself became *flesh* in Christ (cp. [1:1](https://ref.ly/John1:1)). Jesus’ humanity and divinity were complete, not partial. The two ideas—Jesus as 100\-percent divine and 100\-percent human—form the bedrock of a Christian understanding of Christ. • the Word . . . made his home (Greek skēnoō*,* “pitched his tent”) among us: This Greek word is related to the word used for the Old Testament Tabernacle (Greek skēnē*,* “tent, tabernacle”), the tent in the wilderness where the Lord’s glory resided and where Israel came to worship ([Exod 25:8–9](https://ref.ly/Exod25:8-Exod25:9)). The Father’s glory in the Tabernacle ([Exod 40:34–38](https://ref.ly/Exod40:34-Exod40:38)) was now present in Jesus Christ ([John 2:11](https://ref.ly/John2:11); [12:23–28](https://ref.ly/John12:23-John12:28), [41](https://ref.ly/John12:41); [17:1–5](https://ref.ly/John17:1-John17:5)). • Jesus offered God’s unfailing love and faithfulness. Despite the world’s hostile darkness, Jesus entered the world to save it ([3:15–17](https://ref.ly/John3:15-John3:17)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 1:14

## John 1:15 (id: 18789)

he existed long before me: In a society where age was respected and honored ([Lev 19:32](https://ref.ly/Lev19:32); contrast [Isa 3:5](https://ref.ly/Isa3:5)), John the Baptist emphasized Jesus’ honor by pointing to his existence even before creation ([John 1:1–3](https://ref.ly/John1:1-John1:3)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 1:15

## John 1:17 (id: 18790)

the law: That is, the *torah*, the body of instruction given to Moses at Mount Sinai. • Although God’s unfailing love and faithfulness are in the torah, these qualities are fully revealed in Christ ([3:16](https://ref.ly/John3:16); [13:1](https://ref.ly/John13:1)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 1:17

## John 1:18 (id: 18791)

Moses was denied his desire to see God directly ([Exod 33:18–20](https://ref.ly/Exod33:18-Exod33:20)). Only Jesus has seen the Father, so he alone completely knows him and can tell us about him ([John 3:32–35](https://ref.ly/John3:32-John3:35); [14:9–10](https://ref.ly/John14:9-John14:10)). • But the unique One, who is himself God: The Son, who sees the Father, *is himself God—*not simply a messenger who knows something about God. John explicitly affirms Christ’s deity. Jesus shares the substance of God’s being.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 1:18

## John 1:19–51 (id: 18793)

John’s Gospel gives limited attention to John the Baptist compared to the synoptic Gospels ([Matt 3:1–6](https://ref.ly/Matt3:1-Matt3:6); [Mark 1:2–6](https://ref.ly/Mark1:2-Mark1:6); [Luke 1:1–24](https://ref.ly/Luke1:1-Luke1:24), [57–80](https://ref.ly/Luke1:57-Luke1:80); [3:1–13](https://ref.ly/Luke3:1-Luke3:13)). Yet the apostle John wants us to see that John the Baptist correctly identified and exalted Jesus. John the Baptist’s disciples leave him and follow Jesus; Jesus took over the ministry John began, increasing as John decreased ([John 3:30](https://ref.ly/John3:30)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 1:19–JHN 1:51

## John 1:19–12.50 (id: 18792)

Jesus reveals himself to the world through his miraculous signs and sermons. Audiences were divided: Some wanted to believe in him; others opposed him. This division intensifies as the book unfolds. Jesus ended his public ministry with a final appeal for people to believe in him ([12:44–50](https://ref.ly/John12:44-John12:50)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 1:19–JHN 1:28

## John 1:20 (id: 18795)

The Jews expected the Messiah (the Hebrew form of the Greek word *Christ*) to bring spiritual leadership and political redemption to Israel (see [Deut 18:15](https://ref.ly/Deut18:15); see also the Jewish intertestamental book *Psalms of Solomon*).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 1:20

## John 1:21 (id: 18796)

Elijah was to be the Messiah’s forerunner ([Mal 4:5](https://ref.ly/Mal4:5)). John the Baptist fulfilled the forerunner’s role, though he denied being the prophet Elijah (see [Matt 11:14](https://ref.ly/Matt11:14); [Luke 1:17](https://ref.ly/Luke1:17)). • Are you the Prophet we are expecting? Cp. [John 6:14](https://ref.ly/John6:14); [7:40–41](https://ref.ly/John7:40-John7:41).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 1:21

## John 1:22–23 (id: 18797)

Then who are you? John the Baptist simply wanted to be known as a voice shouting in the wilderness (see [Isa 40:3](https://ref.ly/Isa40:3)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 1:22–JHN 1:23

## John 1:24 (id: 18798)

The Pharisees were deeply devoted to the Scriptures and earnestly desired a righteous life. They also believed in the coming Messiah, which explains their inquiries here. Some Pharisees became believers in Jesus ([Acts 15:5](https://ref.ly/Acts15:5)), including the apostle Paul ([Acts 26:5](https://ref.ly/Acts26:5); [Phil 3:5](https://ref.ly/Phil3:5)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 1:24

## John 1:25–26 (id: 18799)

Jewish baptisms were ritual washings for becoming ceremonially pure following contact with impurity ([Lev 8:6](https://ref.ly/Lev8:6); [Num 19:7](https://ref.ly/Num19:7)). • John’s announcement of the Messiah’s arrival required that participants confess their sins and be baptized ([Matt 3:6](https://ref.ly/Matt3:6)). Baptism later became the symbol of membership in Jesus’ kingdom ([Acts 2:38](https://ref.ly/Acts2:38); see also [John 4:1–2](https://ref.ly/John4:1-John4:2)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 1:25–JHN 1:26

## John 1:27 (id: 18800)

A menial task such as removing a sandal was reserved for a slave*;* these tasks were never performed by a disciple.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 1:27

## John 1:29 (id: 18801)

The phrase Lamb of God might refer to the Passover sacrifice of a lamb or to the daily sacrifice in the Temple ([Exod 29:38–46](https://ref.ly/Exod29:38-Exod29:46); [Heb 10](https://ref.ly/Heb10:1-Heb10:39)). See also [Rev 5](https://ref.ly/Rev5:1-Rev5:14).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 1:29

## John 1:32 (id: 18802)

John the Baptist’s second testimony (see [1:19–23](https://ref.ly/John1:19-John1:23)) told what happened when Jesus was baptized. • In the Old Testament, kings and prophets were anointed with the Holy Spirit*,* but these anointings were temporary and tied to a particular office or occasion. By contrast, with the Spirit’s resting on him, Jesus’ anointing was permanent (see [3:34](https://ref.ly/John3:34)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 1:32

## John 1:35–51 (id: 18804)

This section introduces the template for discipleship in John’s Gospel. Disciples desired to come and see Jesus ([1:39](https://ref.ly/John1:39)), and when they encountered him, they remained with him.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 1:35–JHN 1:51

## John 1:40–42 (id: 18807)

Simon is well known in the Gospels, not for his courage and faith, but for his failings (see [18:15–18](https://ref.ly/John18:15-John18:18), [25–27](https://ref.ly/John18:25-John18:27)). Jesus named him Cephas (“the rock”), referring to the great church leader he would later become (see [Acts 1:1–5:42](https://ref.ly/Acts1:1-Acts5:42); [8:1–12:25](https://ref.ly/Acts8:1-Acts12:25); [15:1–41](https://ref.ly/Acts15:1-Acts15:41)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 1:40–JHN 1:42

## John 1:43–44 (id: 18808)

Galilee was the region of northern Israel around the Sea of Galilee. • Bethsaida (“house of fishing”) was a village on Galilee’s north shore and the home of Peter, Andrew, and Philip. Later, Peter and Andrew moved to Capernaum, a village west of Bethsaida ([Mark 1:21](https://ref.ly/Mark1:21), [29](https://ref.ly/Mark1:29)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 1:43–JHN 1:44

## John 1:45 (id: 18809)

Philip*,* a Greek name, and Nathanael*,* a Hebrew name, represent the mix of cultures in Galilee. Jesus’ message there addressed both audiences. When Greeks wanted to see Jesus in Jerusalem, they approached Philip ([12:20–22](https://ref.ly/John12:20-John12:22)). • Jesus grew up in Nazareth*,* a mountain village southwest of the Sea of Galilee.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 1:45

## John 1:46 (id: 18810)

Can anything good come from Nazareth? This village was not considered famous enough to be the hometown for a great leader (cp. [Matt 13:53–58](https://ref.ly/Matt13:53-Matt13:58)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 1:46

## John 1:47 (id: 18811)

Jesus referred to Nathanael as a man of complete integrity*,* contrasting him with Jacob, the scheming, deceitful patriarch whom God renamed Israel (see [Gen 25:27–34](https://ref.ly/Gen25:27-Gen25:34); [27:1–36](https://ref.ly/Gen27:1-Gen27:36); [32:22–32](https://ref.ly/Gen32:22-Gen32:32)). It is as though Nathanael embodied God’s ideal for Israel.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 1:47

## John 1:48–49 (id: 18812)

Jesus captured Nathanael’s attention by knowing his character ([1:47](https://ref.ly/John1:47)), then he captured his worship by supernaturally knowing his previous actions. Nathanael witnessed a miracle and took a remarkable step of faith.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 1:48–JHN 1:49

## John 1:51 (id: 18814)

I tell you the truth (Greek amēn amēn): Jesus often used this expression to emphasize what he was about to say. In John’s Gospel, the Greek word amēn is always doubled. • you will all see heaven open: Jesus made the comparison with Jacob explicit (see study note on 1:47; see [Gen 28:10–22](https://ref.ly/Gen28:10-Gen28:22)). Like Jacob, Nathanael would see God at work. Jesus himself is the new Bethel (“house of God,” [Gen 28:19](https://ref.ly/Gen28:19)), the place where God lives. • Son of Man: See study note on John 9:35; see also [Dan 7:13–14](https://ref.ly/Dan7:13-Dan7:14); [Mark 8:31](https://ref.ly/Mark8:31). • John the apostle used several names for Jesus (Son of God, Son of Man, Messiah). Knowing Jesus’ true identity is necessary to fully understanding and following him.

## John 2:1 (id: 19056)

The ceremonies surrounding a wedding celebration could last as long as a week; weddings often included dramatic processions in which the groom would bring the bride to his home for the festivities ([Matt 25:1–13](https://ref.ly/Matt25:1-Matt25:13)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 2:1

## John 2:1–25 (id: 19051)

In this section, Jesus appeared at two symbolic Jewish ceremonies. At a wedding in Cana ([2:1–12](https://ref.ly/John2:1-John2:12)), he replaced the ritual cleansing water with his own superior wine. Later, around Passover, he cleansed the Temple ([2:13–25](https://ref.ly/John2:13-John2:25)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 2:1–JHN 2:25

## John 2:1–10.42 (id: 19050)

Jesus illustrated his identity and work through the institutions and festivals of Judaism (see [2:1](https://ref.ly/John2:1); [5:1](https://ref.ly/John5:1)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 2:1–JHN 2:16

## John 2:3 (id: 19059)

When the wine supply ran out*,* the host’s family would face embarrassment for failure to plan properly. Perhaps Jesus arrived unexpectedly (cp. [Matt 25:1–13](https://ref.ly/Matt25:1-Matt25:13)), bringing his circle of disciples, which might explain why his mother brought the problem to him. • A wedding banquet was a primary celebration in Jewish village life, and this episode also symbolized the joy of the Messiah’s arrival.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 2:3

## John 2:4 (id: 19060)

Jesus initially distanced himself from the problem. His mission and its timing could not be set by a human agenda. • Jesus’ time (literally *hour*) would come in the future when he was glorified as he was lifted up on the cross ([12:23](https://ref.ly/John12:23); [17:1](https://ref.ly/John17:1)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 2:4

## John 2:6 (id: 19061)

Carved from solid rock, the stone water jars were used for religious washing ceremonies (see [Mark 7:1–4](https://ref.ly/Mark7:1-Mark7:4)). Jesus was about to fill Jewish ceremony with new content.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 2:6

## John 2:9–10 (id: 19062)

The master of ceremonies cited a proverb. The best wine was always served first when palates were most sensitive; yet this miraculous wine, served last, was the very best. Good wine symbolized God’s blessing ([Amos 9:13–14](https://ref.ly/Amos9:13-Amos9:14)). The Messiah, God’s greatest blessing, had arrived at last.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 2:9–JHN 2:10

## John 2:11 (id: 19052)

Jesus had offered his first miraculous sign. In it, he revealed the glory of God (see also [1:14](https://ref.ly/John1:14); [11:4](https://ref.ly/John11:4), [40](https://ref.ly/John11:40)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 2:11

## John 2:13 (id: 19053)

Passover*,* an annual spring festival, commemorated Israel’s rescue from slavery in Egypt ([Exod 12](https://ref.ly/Exod12:1-Exod12:51)). Jews traveled to Jerusalem to participate in the festival ([Deut 16:1–16](https://ref.ly/Deut16:1-Deut16:16)). Because John refers to three Passover festivals ([John 2:13](https://ref.ly/John2:13); [6:4](https://ref.ly/John6:4); [11:55](https://ref.ly/John11:55)), many conclude that Jesus had a three\-year public ministry.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 2:13

## John 2:14–17 (id: 19054)

Those who came for Passover needed to have approved sacrifices for worship. From this need grew a considerable industry for selling animals and exchanging money, but this business was being conducted in the Temple. Jesus, like a prophet, demanded that God’s house be returned to its intended uses—worship, prayer, instruction, and sacrifice. This put Jesus at odds with the Temple leadership. • The synoptic Gospels place the clearing of the Temple near the end of Jesus’ ministry ([Matt 21:12–13](https://ref.ly/Matt21:12-Matt21:13); [Mark 11:15–17](https://ref.ly/Mark11:15-Mark11:17); [Luke 19:45–46](https://ref.ly/Luke19:45-Luke19:46)). John might have placed his account of the event here to emphasize a connection with the miracle that transformed the water in purification jars into wine ([John 2:1–11](https://ref.ly/John2:1-John2:11)). The Temple and the stone jars were both instruments of purification in Judaism. Stone jars filled with water for ritual washing now contained Jesus’ wine, and a stone Temple dedicated to sacrificial purification would be replaced by Christ himself ([2:19–21](https://ref.ly/John2:19-John2:21)). Another view is that Jesus cleared the Temple at the beginning and again at the end of his ministry.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 2:14–JHN 2:17

## John 2:19–21 (id: 19055)

Destroy this temple: Herod the Great began reconstructing the Temple’s magnificent structure in 20 BC, and work on it continued until AD 64\. This explains why Jesus’ audience was amazed when he claimed he could destroy and rebuild it in a few days. However, Jesus spoke figuratively of his own body as the temple where God was present (see [1:14](https://ref.ly/John1:14), [51](https://ref.ly/John1:51))—his body was destroyed and restored in three days through the resurrection, rendering the Jerusalem Temple and its services obsolete. Later, at his trial, Jesus’ symbolic reference to destroying the Temple was used as evidence of blasphemy ([Mark 14:58](https://ref.ly/Mark14:58)).

## John 2:24 (id: 19058)

John uses a play on words here. Because of his signs, many people trusted in Jesus ([2:23](https://ref.ly/John2:23)), but Jesus didn’t trust them. This did not refer to specific people Jesus met in Jerusalem, but reflects his knowledge of all humanity.

born again: Or *born from above.* John’s expression “from above” ([3:31](https://ref.ly/John3:31); [19:11](https://ref.ly/John19:11)) means “from God.” To experience spiritual rebirth, a person must be completely renewed through God’s power. • Nicodemus interpreted Jesus’ words physically; he demonstrated that those in darkness, who do not have spiritual rebirth, cannot understand Jesus or other “heavenly things” ([3:12](https://ref.ly/John3:12)). Jesus sometimes used ironic misunderstanding as a teaching strategy.

The truth that God loved the world is basic to Christian understanding ([1 Jn 4:9–10](https://ref.ly/1John4:9-1John4:10)). God’s love extends beyond the limits of race and nation, even to those who oppose him (see “The World” Theme Note). • The Son came to save—not condemn ([3:17](https://ref.ly/John3:17))—men and women who habitually embrace the darkness ([3:19–21](https://ref.ly/John3:19-John3:21)).

Because there are no quotation marks around Jesus’ speech in the Greek text, translators debate where Jesus’ speech ends and John’s commentary begins; [3:16–21](https://ref.ly/John3:16-John3:21) might be John’s commentary.

## John 3:18 (id: 19107)

As light penetrates and exposes the world’s darkness, God’s judgment on the world has already begun. Those who see this light and recognize the tragedy of their own situation have the responsibility of believing in God’s . . . Son ([3:16–17](https://ref.ly/John3:16-John3:17)).

## John 3:19–20 (id: 19108)

When people live in spiritual darkness*,* they do not desire to be enlightened by Jesus, “the light of the world” ([8:12](https://ref.ly/John8:12); [9:5](https://ref.ly/John9:5)). Evil and darkness do not ignore the light; they wage war against it, trying to bring it down. But the darkness cannot extinguish the light ([1:5](https://ref.ly/John1:5)). Those who refuse to believe live in darkness (cp. [13:30](https://ref.ly/John13:30)) and stumble because they cannot see ([11:10](https://ref.ly/John11:10)). In the end, however, their sins will be exposed ([5:28–30](https://ref.ly/John5:28-John5:30); [Rev 20:11–15](https://ref.ly/Rev20:11-Rev20:15)).

At a historic well in Samaria, Jesus offered himself as living water. Jesus engaged and confronted people with the revelation of God, and they either followed or fell away. • The Samaritan woman contrasted with Nicodemus at every turn: a woman (not a man), a Samaritan (not a Jew), a sinner (not righteous), and an outcast (not one of Israel’s rabbis). While Nicodemus fell silent and never responded to Jesus’ challenges ([3:1–21](https://ref.ly/John3:1-John3:21)), this woman acknowledged Jesus as Lord, remained in the light, and exhibited signs of discipleship (see [1:35–51](https://ref.ly/John1:35-John1:51)).

## John 4:4–6 (id: 19143)

In going north to Galilee, Jesus took the less\-preferred route through Samaria. Samaria had a long history of tension with Judea (see [2 Kgs 17:24–41](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:24-2Kgs17:41); [Ezra 4:1–5](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:1-Ezra4:5); [Neh 4](https://ref.ly/Neh4:1-Neh4:23); [6:1–19](https://ref.ly/Neh6:1-Neh6:19)). In Jesus’ day, harsh racial and cultural conflict existed between Jews and Samaritans. Jews normally avoided Samaria by first going east to Jericho, then following the Jordan Valley north. • Sychar was probably in the region of Shechem. Jesus had come to Jacob’s well*;* Jacob had owned land near Shechem ([Gen 33:18–19](https://ref.ly/Gen33:18-Gen33:19)).

[1:48](https://ref.ly/John1:48)). • As the woman’s understanding of Jesus unfolded, her names for him became increasingly well informed. Earlier she recognized him as *a Jew* ([4:9](https://ref.ly/John4:9)) and called him *sir* ([4:11](https://ref.ly/John4:11), [15](https://ref.ly/John4:15), [19](https://ref.ly/John4:19)). Later she thought he might be *the Messiah* ([4:29](https://ref.ly/John4:29)). Finally, the people of the village recognized him as *Savior of the world* ([4:42](https://ref.ly/John4:42)).

The Samaritans had experienced for themselves that Jesus was true. Their name for Jesus, Savior of the world (also used in [1 Jn 4:14](https://ref.ly/1John4:14)), demonstrated that the Samaritans were keenly aware of their distance from Judaism. Jesus’ ministry was not simply for Jews, but for all people ([John 1:4–12](https://ref.ly/John1:4-John1:12); cp. [12:20–26](https://ref.ly/John12:20-John12:26)).

In this section Jesus appears at a series of Jewish festivals and uses their imagery to reveal more profound truths about himself. He appears at a Sabbath (ch[5](https://ref.ly/John5:1-John5:47)), Passover (ch[6](https://ref.ly/John6:1-John6:71)), the Festival of Shelters (chs[7–9](https://ref.ly/John7:1-John9:41)), and Hanukkah (ch[10](https://ref.ly/John10:1-John10:42)).

Greek copyists who had never been to Jerusalem had difficulty interpreting and spelling the name Bethesda*,* so there are several variants of this name in the manuscripts. The best choice is *Beth\-esda* (“house of flowing”).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 5:2

## John 5:3 (id: 19169)

The pool of Bethesda had become a healing sanctuary for crowds of sick people who believed miraculous cures were possible. • Most scholars believe that the variant reading in the NLT textual note was not part of John’s original text, but it represents an ancient tradition that provided helpful background information.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 5:3

## John 5:5 (id: 19174)

No social program helped this man, who had been ill for thirty\-eight years. Hygiene and mobility were impossible, and he likely begged for a living from people who came to use the pool (see [5:7](https://ref.ly/John5:7)). His situation seemed hopeless.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 5:5

## John 5:8–9 (id: 19175)

Jesus healed the sick man instantly*,* only asking for his obedience. As proof of healing, Jesus told him to pick up his mat and walk. • Jesus worked this miracle on the Sabbath*,* a weekly day of rest on which all work was prohibited (based on [Gen 2:2](https://ref.ly/Gen2:2); [Exod 20:8](https://ref.ly/Exod20:8)). Jewish tradition outlined thirty\-nine categories of work that were not allowed (*Mishnah* *Shabbat* [7:2](https://ref.ly/John7:2)). Carrying something such as a sleeping mat from one place to another was banned ([John 5:10](https://ref.ly/John5:10)). Therefore, the healed man broke the tradition by obeying Jesus’ command.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 5:8–JHN 5:9

## John 5:12 (id: 19154)

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 5:14

## John 5:17 (id: 19156)

My Father is always working, and so am I: Although work was prohibited on the Sabbath, even rabbis agreed that God worked on the Sabbath in giving life (births) and in taking life (deaths). The heart of Jesus’ defense was to compare himself to God; the Jewish leaders objected to this claim of divine privilege.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 5:17

## John 5:19–30 (id: 19157)

Jesus claimed that his work on the Sabbath was the same as God’s work on the Sabbath. Jesus claimed to be equal with God, doing the things God does. Yet he submitted to God’s will, doing only what . . . the Father willed.

## John 5:31–40 (id: 19164)

God’s law requires more than one witness in a trial ([Deut 17:6](https://ref.ly/Deut17:6)), so Jesus acknowledged that his own testimony was admissible only when confirmed by other witnesses. Thus, he introduced a series of witnesses for his defense.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 5:31–JHN 5:40

## John 5:32 (id: 19165)

The first witness for Jesus’ defense was God himself. Jesus might have had in mind God’s voice at his baptism ([Mark 1:11](https://ref.ly/Mark1:11)) or the presence of God that enabled Jesus to perform miracles.

## John 5:41–47 (id: 19170)

Jewish trials sought to discover the truth. Falsely accused defendants could not only prove their innocence but also prosecute their accusers, which Jesus did here.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 5:41–JHN 5:47

## John 5:42 (id: 19171)

Jesus charged that the Jewish leaders did not have God’s love within them. Without God’s love, it was impossible for them to understand the things he was doing.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 5:42

## John 5:44 (id: 19172)

The Jewish leaders pursued honor and prestige from each other. They loved religious life, but they had forgotten to love God. This hypocrisy made them liable to judgment ([5:45–46](https://ref.ly/John5:45-John5:46)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 5:44

## John 5:45–46 (id: 19173)

Jesus’ fifth and final witness was Moses*,* the founding father of Judaism. John had already compared Jesus with Moses ([1:17](https://ref.ly/John1:17); see also [6:14–15](https://ref.ly/John6:14-John6:15)). The Jewish leaders were ignoring Moses’ clear words about the Messiah (e.g., [Deut 18:15](https://ref.ly/Deut18:15)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 5:45–JHN 5:46

## John 6:1–15 (id: 19176)

Jesus’ feeding the 5,000 recalls the great Old Testament miracle of bread when Israel was in the wilderness ([Exod 16](https://ref.ly/Exod16:1-Exod16:36)). The rabbis of Jesus’ day expected the coming Messiah to “rain down food from heaven” once again ([Exod 16:4](https://ref.ly/Exod16:4)), and he did.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 6:1–JHN 6:15

## John 6:1–71 (id: 19177)

Each story in this chapter uses the setting of the Passover Festival ([6:4](https://ref.ly/John6:4)) to communicate a deeper meaning.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 6:1–JHN 6:71

## John 6:5 (id: 19201)

Where can we buy bread: When the Israelites left Egypt following the first Passover and entered the desert, finding food and water was also their first concern ([Exod 15:22–16:3](https://ref.ly/Exod15:22-Exod16:3)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 6:5

## John 6:9 (id: 19207)

Barley was the grain of the poor. The loaves were similar to pita bread. The two fish would have been salted, and with the five loaves of bread would make one meal.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 6:9

## John 6:10 (id: 19178)

The headcount of about 5,000 reflected the men alone ([Matt 14:21](https://ref.ly/Matt14:21)), as social custom dictated. With women and children included, the total number was far greater.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 6:10

## John 6:11 (id: 19179)

The modest meal provided the crowd with as much as they wanted, echoing the miraculous provision of manna in the wilderness ([Exod 16:35](https://ref.ly/Exod16:35)). Moses had first supplied Israel with heavenly bread; Jesus was the new supplier.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 6:11

## John 6:14 (id: 19180)

he is the Prophet we have been expecting! The crowd understood the miracle as a fulfillment of Old Testament promises (see [Deut 18:15](https://ref.ly/Deut18:15), [18](https://ref.ly/Deut18:18); [Mal 4:5–6](https://ref.ly/Mal4:5-Mal4:6)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 6:14

## John 6:15 (id: 19181)

The people were ready to force Jesus to become their king. To avoid this role, Jesus fled the crowd and commanded his disciples to go back across the lake ([Mark 6:45–46](https://ref.ly/Mark6:45-Mark6:46)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 6:15

## John 6:18 (id: 19182)

East\-west winds blowing down over the eastern cliffs of the Sea of Galilee late in the day commonly caused very rough waters and turbulent storms.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 6:18

## John 6:19 (id: 19183)

The disciples’ fear of the storm was now surpassed by their fear of Jesus*,* who came walking on the water to help them. This act recalled Moses, who led Israel through the water ([Exod 14](https://ref.ly/Exod14:1-Exod14:31); see [Ps 77:19–20](https://ref.ly/Ps77:19-Ps77:20)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 6:19

## John 6:20 (id: 19184)

I am here (Greek reads *I am*): Jesus identified himself by the name God had revealed to Moses on Mount Sinai (see [Exod 3:14](https://ref.ly/Exod3:14); see also [John 4:26](https://ref.ly/John4:26); [6:35](https://ref.ly/John6:35)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 6:20

## John 6:21 (id: 19185)

immediately they arrived at their destination: The immediacy was yet another of Jesus’ miracles.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 6:21

## John 6:24 (id: 19186)

The crowd sailed north to Capernaum to search for Jesus because he had made Capernaum his home in Galilee ([Mark 2:1](https://ref.ly/Mark2:1)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 6:24

## John 6:26 (id: 19188)

The crowd, which had concluded that Jesus was a prophet and wanted to take advantage of him politically (see [6:15](https://ref.ly/John6:15)), failed to see the meaning of the miracle, which Jesus then explained ([6:27–59](https://ref.ly/John6:27-John6:59)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 6:26

## John 6:26–59 (id: 19187)

This dialogue took place in the synagogue at Capernaum ([6:59](https://ref.ly/John6:59)) shortly before Passover ([6:4](https://ref.ly/John6:4)), when Jews read the account of the exodus from Egypt (see [Exod 1–15](https://ref.ly/Exod1:1-Exod15:27)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 6:26–JHN 6:59

## John 6:27 (id: 19189)

Jesus’ most profound gift was not physical bread, but eternal life, which the Father authorized him to give. Physical bread is perishable*;* the gift of Jesus, who is himself the bread of life ([6:35](https://ref.ly/John6:35)), will last forever.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 6:27

## John 6:30 (id: 19190)

The crowd demanded a miraculous sign to demonstrate Jesus’ status as Messiah. Jews believed that when the Messiah appeared, he would duplicate the great miracle of Moses. Manna would once again fall, and everyone would consider it a second exodus.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 6:30

## John 6:32–33 (id: 19191)

Jesus corrected the people’s argument: God, not Moses, fed Israel in the wilderness. The most important quest is to find and consume the true bread of God*,* who gives eternal life.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 6:32–JHN 6:33

## John 6:34 (id: 19192)

Sir, . . . give us that bread: This request parallels the request of the Samaritan woman ([4:15](https://ref.ly/John4:15)). Spiritual awakening begins with a request for God’s gift.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 6:34

## John 6:35 (id: 19193)

Jesus’ I am statements in John depict Jesus’ identity and ministry (see also [4:26](https://ref.ly/John4:26); [8:12](https://ref.ly/John8:12); [9:5](https://ref.ly/John9:5); [10:7–9](https://ref.ly/John10:7-John10:9), [11–14](https://ref.ly/John10:11-John10:14); [11:25](https://ref.ly/John11:25); [14:6](https://ref.ly/John14:6); [15:1–5](https://ref.ly/John15:1-John15:5)). Jesus purposefully used a phrase that would make his listeners think of the Old Testament name for God ([Exod 3:14](https://ref.ly/Exod3:14)). • I am the bread of life: Jesus is the true manna that descended from God ([John 6:38](https://ref.ly/John6:38)). He satisfies the spiritual hunger of those who believe in him (cp. [4:10–13](https://ref.ly/John4:10-John4:13)).

those the Father has given: God moves in people’s hearts, bringing them to Jesus.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 6:37

## John 6:37–40 (id: 19194)

Jesus’ mission in the world is sure to succeed. God sent Jesus ([6:38](https://ref.ly/John6:38)) and calls people to follow him ([6:37](https://ref.ly/John6:37), [44](https://ref.ly/John6:44)). Those who come to him are secure in Jesus’ promise that he will not reject them or lose them ([6:39](https://ref.ly/John6:39)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 6:37–JHN 6:40

## John 6:41–42 (id: 19196)

When Jesus identified himself as the true bread . . . from heaven*,* the crowd faced a decision. • Isn’t this . . . the son of Joseph? They stumbled because their familiarity with Jesus made his claims seem outlandish.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 6:41–JHN 6:42

## John 6:43–51 (id: 19197)

Stop complaining: Rather than defending himself against their complaint ([6:42](https://ref.ly/John6:42)), Jesus turns to the problem of their spiritual receptivity. Those who love the Father and listen to him will believe in Jesus.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 6:43–JHN 6:51

## John 6:49–50 (id: 19198)

Jesus connected the manna of the Exodus with himself, then pointed out a major difference: The Israelites remained mortal and they all died*,* whereas the bread from heaven (Jesus himself) provides eternal life ([6:47](https://ref.ly/John6:47), [51](https://ref.ly/John6:51),[58](https://ref.ly/John6:58)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 6:49–JHN 6:50

## John 6:51 (id: 19199)

this bread . . . is my flesh: The gift that brings life is now unveiled. On the cross, Jesus offered his flesh for the life of the world.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 6:51

## John 6:53–58 (id: 19200)

eat the flesh . . . drink his blood: Jesus answered the question the people asked ([6:52](https://ref.ly/John6:52)). His words hinted at the Lord’s Supper yet to come (see [Luke 22:19](https://ref.ly/Luke22:19)). Since “flesh and blood” was a Jewish idiom for the whole person, Jesus might have been calling people to consume him fully by completely believing in him. Some Christian traditions see the bread as Christ’s literal flesh broken for us and the wine as his literal blood poured out for us. Others take the meaning in purely spiritual terms. Either way, receiving communion means no less than embracing Jesus’ life\-giving sacrifice.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 6:53–JHN 6:58

## John 6:60–61 (id: 19202)

Jesus’ language ([6:53–58](https://ref.ly/John6:53-John6:58)) was shocking, offensive (see [Gen 9:4–5](https://ref.ly/Gen9:4-Gen9:5)), and hard to understand for his disciples, just as it was to the crowd. Were they to take him literally? How would they eat his flesh? Jesus’ answer is in [John 6:63](https://ref.ly/John6:63).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 6:60–JHN 6:61

## John 6:63 (id: 19203)

The essence of Jesus’ gift is found in the Holy Spirit alone*,* not in human effort (literally *the flesh*). Life and understanding come through the gift of the Spirit (see [14:15–20](https://ref.ly/John14:15-John14:20); [20:21–22](https://ref.ly/John20:21-John20:22)). True life can be found only when the Holy Spirit infuses human life.

## John 6:65 (id: 19204)

people can’t come to me unless the Father gives them to me (see [6:44](https://ref.ly/John6:44)): Only God’s light can penetrate the profound darkness of the world.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 6:65

## John 6:68–69 (id: 19205)

Simon Peter often served as spokesman for the Twelve (see also [Matt 14:28–29](https://ref.ly/Matt14:28-Matt14:29); [16:16](https://ref.ly/Matt16:16); [17:4](https://ref.ly/Matt17:4); [18:21](https://ref.ly/Matt18:21); [19:27](https://ref.ly/Matt19:27); [26:33–35](https://ref.ly/Matt26:33-Matt26:35)).

## John 6:70–71 (id: 19206)

Once again Jesus demonstrated supernatural knowledge (see [1:47–49](https://ref.ly/John1:47-John1:49); [4:16–19](https://ref.ly/John4:16-John4:19)). Judas would work for evil and betray Jesus to the authorities ([12:4](https://ref.ly/John12:4); [13:2](https://ref.ly/John13:2); [Matt 26:14–16](https://ref.ly/Matt26:14-Matt26:16)). • Iscariot means “man from Kerioth,” the home village of Judas’s family.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 6:70–JHN 6:71

## John 7:1–52 (id: 19208)

This chapter is another account of Jesus during a Jewish festival, the Festival of Shelters. Jesus used elements of the festival to reveal his true identity to his Jewish compatriots and to show that he had fulfilled the festival’s essential meaning (see [7:37–39](https://ref.ly/John7:37-John7:39); [8:12](https://ref.ly/John8:12)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 7:1–JHN 7:52

## John 7:2 (id: 19216)

Jewish men were required to come to the Temple for the Festival of Shelters ([Exod 23:14–17](https://ref.ly/Exod23:14-Exod23:17); [Deut 16:16](https://ref.ly/Deut16:16)), an annual seven\-day autumn harvest festival in Jerusalem six months after Passover ([John 6:4](https://ref.ly/John6:4)). People lived in temporary shelters for the seven days as a reminder of the tents Israel used for forty years in the wilderness.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 7:2

## John 7:3–5 (id: 19217)

Jesus’ brothers (see also [Mark 3:31](https://ref.ly/Mark3:31)) reminded him of his religious obligation to celebrate the festival. Their words were cynical because at this time they didn’t believe in him ([John 7:5](https://ref.ly/John7:5)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 7:3–JHN 7:5

## John 7:6–8 (id: 19227)

Jesus said that it was not the right time for him to go publicly to Jerusalem, although he later went secretly ([7:10](https://ref.ly/John7:10); cp. study note on 12:23).

## John 7:15 (id: 19209)

The leaders wanted Jesus to show his credentials. Jesus had not been trained under a rabbi but was taught by his heavenly Father (cp. Peter and John, [Acts 4:13](https://ref.ly/Acts4:13); contrast Paul, [Acts 22:3](https://ref.ly/Acts22:3)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 7:15

## John 7:17 (id: 19210)

Those who truly want to do the will of God receive and accept Jesus and his teaching (see also [5:42–47](https://ref.ly/John5:42-John5:47)). Those who focus on the world, by contrast, are not receptive to Christ.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 7:17

## John 7:19 (id: 19211)

Moses gave you the law, but none of you obeys it! The Jewish leaders were proud of the law of Moses, but ironically, in trying to kill Jesus, they were breaking the law ([Exod 20:13](https://ref.ly/Exod20:13)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 7:19

## John 7:20 (id: 19212)

You’re demon possessed! See [8:48–52](https://ref.ly/John8:48-John8:52); [10:20–21](https://ref.ly/John10:20-John10:21).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 7:20

## John 7:22 (id: 19213)

The law required circumcision on the eighth day ([Lev 12:3](https://ref.ly/Lev12:3)) and permitted a boy to be circumcised even if that day fell on the Sabbath. Jesus argued as a rabbi would, from “the lesser to the greater,” using circumcision as a precedent for healing, both of which are religious works.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 7:22

## John 7:27 (id: 19214)

Some of the crowd thought that since they could trace Jesus’ earthly origins, he could not be the Messiah. They believed that the Messiah would simply appear.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 7:27

## John 7:29 (id: 19215)

I come from him: Jesus sidestepped the speculation ([7:27](https://ref.ly/John7:27), [40–44](https://ref.ly/John7:40-John7:44)) about his earthly origins and focused on his heavenly origins. His astounding claim provoked the religious leaders to try to arrest him for blasphemy ([7:30](https://ref.ly/John7:30); cp. [10:30–33](https://ref.ly/John10:30-John10:33)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 7:29

## John 7:30 (id: 19218)

Jesus’ opponents failed to arrest him because in God’s sovereign plan, his time*,* when he would be glorified on the cross, had not yet come (see study note on 12:23; see also [10:17–18](https://ref.ly/John10:17-John10:18); [18:6–8](https://ref.ly/John18:6-John18:8)). All four arrest scenes in [7:1–8:59](https://ref.ly/John7:1-John8:59) stress that Jesus was in control, not the Jewish leaders.

## John 7:32–36 (id: 19219)

Jesus announced his return to the one who sent him, the Father in heaven ([17:1–7](https://ref.ly/John17:1-John17:7)). However, the Pharisees misunderstood, thinking he was leaving Judea to go among Gentiles (whom Pharisees would never visit). • The leaders would not find Jesus after his ascension. • you cannot go where I am going: These Pharisees, still in darkness, could not enter heaven, so Jesus would be beyond their reach there.

## John 7:37–38 (id: 19220)

living water: See [4:10–14](https://ref.ly/John4:10-John4:14). A water ceremony was held each day during the Festival of Shelters, with prayer for God to send rain in the late autumn. The final day, called “the great day,” was the climax of the festival*,* when the ceremony was repeated seven times. Water was poured over the altar as Levites sang [Isa 12:3](https://ref.ly/Isa12:3) (see [Zech 14:8](https://ref.ly/Zech14:8); see also *Mishnah Sukkah* ch 4\). • Anyone who is thirsty may come to me!

## John 7:39 (id: 19221)

In Jesus’ crucifixion and resurrection, his life and the Spirit were poured out (see [19:34](https://ref.ly/John19:34); [20:22](https://ref.ly/John20:22)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 7:39

## John 7:41–42 (id: 19222)

These Jews, different from the crowd ([7:25–27](https://ref.ly/John7:25-John7:27)) who thought the Messiah would appear mysteriously, believed the prophecy that the Messiah would be from Bethlehem of Judea (see [Mic 5:2](https://ref.ly/Mic5:2)). However, they stumbled over the fact that Jesus seemed to be from Galilee*,* where he grew up.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 7:41–JHN 7:42

## John 7:45–52 (id: 19223)

The story concludes with the Jewish leaders frustrated and the world divided over Jesus (cp. [7:25–27](https://ref.ly/John7:25-John7:27), [31–32](https://ref.ly/John7:31-John7:32)). • guards returned: See [7:32](https://ref.ly/John7:32).

Nicodemus was probably in the process of coming to faith (see [3:1–21](https://ref.ly/John3:1-John3:21); [19:38–42](https://ref.ly/John19:38-John19:42)). Contrary to the implication of [7:48](https://ref.ly/John7:48), some of the Pharisees—not just the ignorant crowd—believed in Jesus.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 7:49–JHN 7:51

## John 7:52 (id: 19225)

no prophet ever comes from Galilee! The Jewish leaders were apparently unaware that Jesus had been born in Bethlehem of Judea, not in Galilee (see [Matt 2:1](https://ref.ly/Matt2:1); [Luke 2:1–7](https://ref.ly/Luke2:1-Luke2:7)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 7:52

## John 7:53–8.11 (id: 19226)

This story, a later addition to the Gospel of John, does not appear in the earliest Greek manuscripts. However, it is likely an authentic story from Jesus’ life.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 7:53–JHN 8:11

## John 8:3 (id: 19245)

The teachers of religious law were Jewish scholars who specialized in knowing the Old Testament law and the oral traditions that interpreted the law.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 8:3

## John 8:4 (id: 19249)

The form of the Greek sentence emphasizes the legal claim against the woman. She had been caught while committing the sin of adultery. The law required two witnesses and carefully outlined what evidence was needed.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 8:4

## John 8:5 (id: 19255)

The requirement of the law . . . to stone her indicates that the woman was engaged or married ([Lev 20:10](https://ref.ly/Lev20:10); [Deut 22:23–24](https://ref.ly/Deut22:23-Deut22:24)). The law also stated that her lover should be killed with her, but these religious leaders apparently ignored their obligation to that part of the statute. • These men could have dealt with the woman privately and kept her from public shame, but Jesus was their real target as they demanded, What do you say? Would he neglect the law since he had a reputation for mercy? Or would he ignore the woman’s tragedy?

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 8:5

## John 8:6 (id: 19256)

It is impossible to know what Jesus . . . wrote in the dust. It has been suggested that he wrote the sins of the accusers.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 8:6

## John 8:7 (id: 19257)

Jesus’ answer did not mean that an accuser had to be morally perfect to make legal accusations. His reference to the one who has never sinned points to the motives of the accusers.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 8:7

## John 8:9 (id: 19258)

The jury crumbled as they slipped away. One accuser departed, followed by another, and then a succession of bystanders.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 8:9

## John 8:11 (id: 19228)

Neither do I: Jesus’ words of assurance did not suggest that the woman was innocent. Jesus views sin and judgment seriously, yet he looks graciously and forgivingly on those caught in sin’s grip.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 8:11

## John 8:12 (id: 19230)

During the Festival of Shelters, sixteen gold bowls in the inner courts of the Temple were filled with oil and lighted. Jesus stood beneath these lights in the Temple ([8:20](https://ref.ly/John8:20)) and said that he was now the source of the light. Jesus’ light brings salvation not only to Israel but to the world*,* regardless of race or locale.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 8:12

## John 8:12–59 (id: 19229)

The debate about whether or not Jesus is the Messiah continues from [7:52](https://ref.ly/John7:52). Jesus was still at the Festival of Shelters in Jerusalem. During the festival, the conflicts Jesus had endured in ch[7](https://ref.ly/John7:1-John7:53) continued and intensified.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 8:12–JHN 8:59

## John 8:13 (id: 19231)

The Pharisees charged that Jesus’ claims were not valid because Jewish law ([Deut 19:15](https://ref.ly/Deut19:15)) requires more than one witness (cp. [John 5:31–32](https://ref.ly/John5:31-John5:32); see [8:17](https://ref.ly/John8:17)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 8:13

## John 8:14–15 (id: 19232)

Jesus answered the Pharisees’ charges, saying that he could make such claims about himself because he knew both his origin (heaven) and his destination (heaven). He then pointed to the most vital witness for his case, his Father who sent him ([8:16](https://ref.ly/John8:16)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 8:14–JHN 8:15

Once again, the festival audience was divided. Earlier, the debate concluded with plans to arrest Jesus ([8:20](https://ref.ly/John8:20)). Now many . . . believed in him, convinced that he was telling the truth.

Jesus challenged a widely held assumption about Israel’s status as God’s chosen people. Their heritage as descendants of Abraham had inspired feelings of privilege and immunity rather than obligation and responsibility (cp. [Amos 3:1–15](https://ref.ly/Amos3:1-Amos3:15)). • The people misunderstood what it meant to be set free. Jesus was not referring to freedom from human slavery; he meant release from spiritual bondage to sin ([John 8:34](https://ref.ly/John8:34)). Truth, not their religious heritage, would free them ([8:32](https://ref.ly/John8:32); [Rom 6:17](https://ref.ly/Rom6:17); [8:2](https://ref.ly/Rom8:2); [1 Jn 3:4](https://ref.ly/1John3:4), [8](https://ref.ly/1John3:8), [9](https://ref.ly/1John3:9)).

The leaders’ plot to kill Jesus ([5:18](https://ref.ly/John5:18)) unmasked their true identity. They belonged to a different household, and their father was not Jesus’ Father.

Since the unbelieving people did not love Jesus ([8:42](https://ref.ly/John8:42); [1 Jn 5:1](https://ref.ly/1John5:1)), they were not children of the Father in heaven who sent his beloved Son ([John 8:47](https://ref.ly/John8:47)). Their true spiritual ancestry was revealed in their desire to kill God’s Son. This was the work of the devil*,* who brought death to the world (see [Gen 3:1–20](https://ref.ly/Gen3:1-Gen3:20); [Rom 5:12–14](https://ref.ly/Rom5:12-Rom5:14)).

At the Festival of Shelters (chs[7–8](https://ref.ly/John7:1-John8:59)), Jesus claimed to be the light of the world ([8:12](https://ref.ly/John8:12)). Now John tells about Jesus giving light, both physically and spiritually, to a blind man who lived in darkness (see [9:5](https://ref.ly/John9:5)). The story ends with a splendid reversal of roles: The blind man who was assumed to be in spiritual darkness could see God’s light, whereas the Pharisees, who could see physically and were thought to be enlightened, were shown to be spiritually blind.

Siloam*,* a pool at the south end of the city of Jerusalem, was the source of water for the ceremonies at the Festival of Shelters. • Siloam means “sent”: This phrase contained a double meaning: Jesus, who has been sent by God ([4:34](https://ref.ly/John4:34); [5:23](https://ref.ly/John5:23), [37](https://ref.ly/John5:37); [7:28](https://ref.ly/John7:28); [8:26](https://ref.ly/John8:26); [12:44](https://ref.ly/John12:44); [14:24](https://ref.ly/John14:24)), told the blind man to wash in the pool called “sent.”

The Pharisees (see [1:24](https://ref.ly/John1:24)) were arbiters of legal interpretation, so the community looked to them to explain this miracle.

In the story, the blind man and his family frequently confessed that they did not know, while the Pharisees repeatedly stated their confidence and remained guilty because of their religious pride. If they had confessed their ignorance and admitted their spiritual blindness, they would be guiltless. Instead, their conscious and willful rejection of Jesus established their guilt.

## John 10:1 (id: 18828)

A wilderness shepherd would build a sheepfold*,* a pen with low stone walls topped by thorny branches, to hold his sheep at night and protect them from danger. • The pen had one gate (or opening in the wall) that was closed with branches. Any invasion of the pen was a threat to the flock. • A bad shepherd was like a thief and a robber. He exploited the sheep for his own interests and did not care for or nurture them. Bad shepherds took the sheep’s milk and wool for themselves and butchered the sheep without providing for the animal’s safety ([Ezek 34:3](https://ref.ly/Ezek34:3); see [Isa 56:11](https://ref.ly/Isa56:11); [Jer 23:1–4](https://ref.ly/Jer23:1-Jer23:4)). This was Jesus’ most stinging indictment of the Jewish leaders.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 10:1

## John 10:1–21 (id: 18818)

This illustration of a shepherd and his sheep assumes a Middle Eastern understanding of shepherding and draws on Old Testament tradition deeply embedded in first\-century Jewish culture. God was the shepherd of Israel ([Gen 49:24](https://ref.ly/Gen49:24); [Pss 23](https://ref.ly/Ps23:1-Ps23:6); [78:52–53](https://ref.ly/Ps78:52-Ps78:53); [Isa 40:10–11](https://ref.ly/Isa40:10-Isa40:11)). Spiritual and political leaders of Israel were also shepherds of God’s people, the flock of God ([Isa 56:9–12](https://ref.ly/Isa56:9-Isa56:12); [Jer 23:1–4](https://ref.ly/Jer23:1-Jer23:4); [Ezek 34](https://ref.ly/Ezek34:1-Ezek34:31)). Jesus’ sermon builds on the occasion of Hanukkah (see [John 10:22](https://ref.ly/John10:22)) to address the theme of shepherds, using this festival as an opportunity to reflect on Israel’s leaders (“shepherds”) in light of [Ezek 34](https://ref.ly/Ezek34:1-Ezek34:31).

Small villages often created communal flocks and employed a hired hand to tend the sheep. However, an employee lacked the commitment of a true shepherd. The wilderness of Judea had many predators.

Hanukkah was a winter festival that commemorated the rededication of the Temple after it had been defiled by Antiochus IV (175–163 BC). Two hundred years before Christ, Greek soldiers captured and pillaged the Jerusalem Temple, took its treasures and artifacts, and made it unusable for worship. In the winter of 165–164 BC, a Jewish army led by Judas Maccabeus reclaimed the Temple and rededicated it to the Lord. The Festival of Hanukkah (“dedication”) marked this dedication (see *1 Maccabees* 3–4; *2 Maccabees* 8:1–10:8\). During the festival, priests examined their commitment to service, using [Ezek 34](https://ref.ly/Ezek34:1-Ezek34:31) as their principal text for reflection (also [Jer 23:1–4](https://ref.ly/Jer23:1-Jer23:4); [25:32–38](https://ref.ly/Jer25:32-Jer25:38); [Zech 11](https://ref.ly/Zech11:1-Zech11:17)). At this Hanukkah celebration, Jesus used the shepherd theme from [Ezek 34](https://ref.ly/Ezek34:1-Ezek34:31) to distinguish between himself as the good shepherd ([John 10:11](https://ref.ly/John10:11)) and Israel’s current religious leaders as bad shepherds ([10:10](https://ref.ly/John10:10), [12–13](https://ref.ly/John10:12-John10:13)).

## John 10:24 (id: 18831)

The people who surrounded Jesus might have been seeking clarity, or they might have been hostile. In [Luke 21:20](https://ref.ly/Luke21:20) and [Heb 11:30](https://ref.ly/Heb11:30), the same word describes how Jerusalem and Jericho were surrounded before being destroyed; in [Acts 14:20](https://ref.ly/Acts14:20) it refers to Paul’s disciples rallying around him after he was injured.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 10:24

## John 10:25 (id: 18833)

Jesus had already provided the Jewish people and their religious leaders with sufficient proof that he is the Son of God. The problem was not lack of information, but their unwillingness to believe him.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 10:25

## John 10:25–42 (id: 18832)

In Jesus’ final public presentation of evidence about himself in this Gospel, he gives an exhaustive statement of his identity ([10:30](https://ref.ly/John10:30)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 10:25–JHN 10:42

## John 10:27–29 (id: 18834)

As the good shepherd, Jesus would die for his sheep and secure them from all predators and thieves ([10:1](https://ref.ly/John10:1), [8](https://ref.ly/John10:8), [11](https://ref.ly/John10:11); cp. [Ezek 34:22–23](https://ref.ly/Ezek34:22-Ezek34:23)). • The power of the Father*,* appearing in Christ, keeps his sheep safe. Believers cannot be taken from Jesus because no one is more powerful than he is. Their security is not sustained by their own efforts, but by Christ. • The word translated snatch implies violence (as in [John 6:15](https://ref.ly/John6:15)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 10:27–JHN 10:29

## John 10:30 (id: 18835)

The Father and the Son are two separate persons with one purpose and nature ([1:1](https://ref.ly/John1:1), [14](https://ref.ly/John1:14); [14:9](https://ref.ly/John14:9); [20:28](https://ref.ly/John20:28)). This is the basis of Jesus’ power to protect God’s flock ([10:28–29](https://ref.ly/John10:28-John10:29)) and a stunning expression of Jesus’ divinity.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 10:30

## John 10:31–33 (id: 18836)

The people realized Jesus’ meaning (see [10:33](https://ref.ly/John10:33)) and wanted to kill him. The problem was not Jesus’ good works*,* but his claim to divinity (see [6:42](https://ref.ly/John6:42), [60](https://ref.ly/John6:60); [7:29–30](https://ref.ly/John7:29-John7:30)).

## John 10:34–36 (id: 18837)

I say, you are gods! If the word *god* could be applied to people other than the Lord, then Jesus was not breaking the law by referring to himself in this way. Yet Jesus is not just any son of God; he is the Son of God who was sent . . . into the world.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 10:41

## John 10:42 (id: 18842)

This is a note of irony. While Jesus found little faith among the religious leaders in the holy city of Jerusalem, in the desert he found many who . . . believed.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 10:42

## John 11:1 (id: 18850)

In Hebrew, Lazarus is a shortened form of *Eleazar* (“God helps”). Among Jews in the first century, it was the fourth\-most\-common name for a man (see also [Luke 16:19–31](https://ref.ly/Luke16:19-Luke16:31)). • Bethany was a small village east of Jerusalem just over the Mount of Olives ([John 11:18](https://ref.ly/John11:18)) and was where Jesus often stayed when he was in Jerusalem. Jesus would have traveled through Bethany on the way to Jerusalem because most Jews coming from Galilee used a route going south to Jericho, then west to Jerusalem. • Mary and Martha were sisters ([Luke 10:38–42](https://ref.ly/Luke10:38-Luke10:42)). Martha was probably older; she was the host in Luke’s story and here represented the family. Mary later anointed Jesus with perfume ([John 12:1–8](https://ref.ly/John12:1-John12:8)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 11:1

## John 11:1–57 (id: 18846)

The raising of Lazarus foreshadows Jesus’ own coming death and resurrection. Even the description of Lazarus’ grave ([11:38](https://ref.ly/John11:38), [44](https://ref.ly/John11:44)) prefigures Jesus’ grave ([20:1](https://ref.ly/John20:1), [7](https://ref.ly/John20:7)). Shortly after this event, Jesus was anointed for burial ([12:3](https://ref.ly/John12:3)) and the hour of his glorification began ([12:23](https://ref.ly/John12:23)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 11:1–JHN 11:57

## John 11:3 (id: 18859)

The two sisters had a dilemma. They knew Jesus’ power as a healer, but they also realized that his return to Judea would entail personal risk ([11:8](https://ref.ly/John11:8)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 11:3

## John 11:4 (id: 18863)

Jesus’ response paralleled his words about the man born blind ([9:1–5](https://ref.ly/John9:1-John9:5)). Jesus already knew that Lazarus was dead ([11:14](https://ref.ly/John11:14)); he was talking about Lazarus’ resurrection ([11:43](https://ref.ly/John11:43)), which would bring glory to God.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 11:4

## John 11:6 (id: 18868)

The trip from where Jesus was staying (see [10:40](https://ref.ly/John10:40)) to Bethany would have taken only one day, but Jesus followed his own sense of timing ([2:4](https://ref.ly/John2:4); [7:5–9](https://ref.ly/John7:5-John7:9)) and would not be compelled by others.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 11:6

## John 11:8 (id: 18869)

The disciples were rightly worried about the risk (see [7:25](https://ref.ly/John7:25); [8:37](https://ref.ly/John8:37), [44](https://ref.ly/John8:44), [59](https://ref.ly/John8:59); [10:31](https://ref.ly/John10:31), [39](https://ref.ly/John10:39)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 11:16

## John 11:17 (id: 18848)

People were buried on the same day as their death. John noted that Lazarus had been in his grave for four days*,* so the miracle could not be construed as resuscitation.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 11:17

## John 11:19 (id: 18849)

Life in New Testament times was lived publicly. Lazarus’s large extended family, as well as the villagers, had arrived for a seven\-day mourning period. To console the sisters in their loss, there was great wailing and crying (see [11:33](https://ref.ly/John11:33) and corresponding study note).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 11:19

## John 11:21 (id: 18851)

Lord, if only you had been here: Mary later repeated Martha’s words ([11:32](https://ref.ly/John11:32)), because both sisters knew Jesus’ reputation as a healer. They concluded that Jesus would have healed Lazarus, but they did not imagine that Jesus would restore him from death.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 11:21

## John 11:22 (id: 18852)

whatever you ask: Martha thought that Jesus could still intervene in some way. Despite this, she objected when Jesus wanted to open the tomb ([11:39](https://ref.ly/John11:39)); she wasn’t thinking that Jesus would raise her brother from the dead.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 11:22

## John 11:24 (id: 18853)

when everyone else rises, at the last day: Martha misunderstood (cp. [11:11–13](https://ref.ly/John11:11-John11:13)), thinking that Jesus was referring to the general resurrection of the dead at the end of time.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 11:24

## John 11:25 (id: 18854)

Jesus helped Martha to believe in him not simply as a healer, but as one who vanquishes death. • I am the resurrection and the life: Victory over death is an aspect of living in association with Jesus. Although his followers are still mortal, they will enjoy eternal life after death. Regarding Jesus’ *I am* statements, see the study note on 6:35.

## John 11:26–27 (id: 18855)

Do you believe this? Jesus was not asking if Martha believed he could bring Lazarus from the grave. Rather, did she believe that life itself is linked to Jesus? • “Yes, Lord”: Even though the full implications were beyond her comprehension, she acknowledged that Jesus was indeed the Messiah. Yet she was surprised at the power he held.

## John 11:28–32 (id: 18856)

Mary now joined the scene on the edge of the village, repeating her sister’s plaintive cry. She fell at Jesus’ feet, not in worship but in desperate grief.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 11:28–JHN 11:32

## John 11:33 (id: 18857)

The loud weeping and wailing typified public displays of grief in this culture ([Mark 5:38](https://ref.ly/Mark5:38)), as did beating one’s chest ([Luke 18:13](https://ref.ly/Luke18:13)). • The Greek word translated deep anger expresses human outrage, fury, and anger. Jesus was furious, not at Martha or Mary, but at the futility of this scene and the people’s unbelief in light of the reality of the resurrection.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 11:33

## John 11:39 (id: 18858)

Lazarus was buried in a tomb cut from the rocky hillside; such tombs were common. The tomb was closed and opened for further burials with a rolling stone that covered the entrance. A central door led to a cave room where burial benches were carved in stone along the inner wall. Horizontal burial chambers were cut along the top edge of the benches.

As news of the miracle spread rapidly into the city of Jerusalem ([12:9](https://ref.ly/John12:9), [17](https://ref.ly/John12:17)), public opinion was again divided ([6:66–69](https://ref.ly/John6:66-John6:69); [7:43](https://ref.ly/John7:43); [9:16](https://ref.ly/John9:16); [10:19](https://ref.ly/John10:19); [11:37](https://ref.ly/John11:37)). Jesus’ reputation as a healer and as one who could raise the dead was known in Galilee (see [Matt 9:24–26](https://ref.ly/Matt9:24-Matt9:26); [10:8](https://ref.ly/Matt10:8); [11:5](https://ref.ly/Matt11:5)).

## John 11:48 (id: 18861)

The council’s deliberations unveiled their fears that everyone would believe in him. If people believed that the Messiah had come, the political implications would be threatening. The Romans viewed Jewish messiahs with suspicion, and the movement surrounding Jesus might inspire them to invade and destroy Jerusalem and its Temple.

Caiaphas was the ruler of the high council from AD 18–36\. He worked for ten years alongside Pontius Pilate, governor of Judea (AD 26–36; see [18:29](https://ref.ly/John18:29)), keeping the peace with Rome.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 11:49

## John 11:50–51 (id: 18864)

it’s better . . . that one man should die: Caiaphas’s words were ironic. He meant that it was better for a revolutionary to die than to have the Romans crush the entire Jewish nation. But Caiaphas was correct in a way that he could not perceive. The salvation that Judaism needed had little to do with Rome; it would come through the cross of Christ. John notes that Caiaphas’s inspiration was not his own but came from God.

When the Jewish leaders began to plot Jesus’ death*,* Jesus made a judicious political move in response ([11:54](https://ref.ly/John11:54)). • Ephraim was a village about twelve miles north of Jerusalem, where Jesus was safe from the Sanhedrin but close enough to walk to the upcoming Passover festival ([11:55](https://ref.ly/John11:55)).

As crowds arrived in Jerusalem on pilgrimage for Passover (see [2:13](https://ref.ly/John2:13)), the city was buzzing with talk about Jesus and his miracle of raising Lazarus from the dead. People wondered if Jesus would be obedient to the law and come to the city to celebrate or play it safe in the countryside. The priests and Pharisees knew that Jesus was faithful to the law and would attend the festival, so they tried to make the city a trap for him.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 11:55–JHN 11:57

Pilgrims from throughout Israel began arriving in Jerusalem the week before the Passover. The festival was on Thursday that year; Jesus arrived late the preceding Friday, just before the Sabbath.

Two stories build simultaneously. A growing number of people are praising Jesus (this climaxes in [12:12–13](https://ref.ly/John12:12-John12:13)), and the authorities are increasingly determined to arrest him and put him to death. • John records three events that occurred just days prior to Passover ([12:1–11](https://ref.ly/John12:1-John12:11), [12–19](https://ref.ly/John12:12-John12:19), [20–36](https://ref.ly/John12:20-John12:36)).

Twelve ounces of nard cost a year’s wages ([John 12:5](https://ref.ly/John12:5)). According to Mark, Mary also anointed Jesus’ head ([Mark 14:3](https://ref.ly/Mark14:3)), and the perfume ran down and scented his garments ([Mark 14:8](https://ref.ly/Mark14:8)). • her hair: Women never unveiled their hair in public (see [Luke 7:38](https://ref.ly/Luke7:38)).

The phrase Hail to the King of Israel is not in the psalm (but see [Zeph 3:15](https://ref.ly/Zeph3:15)).

By choosing a young donkey rather than a warhorse*,* Jesus calmed the frenzied crowd that was passionate for his kingship. He also fulfilled Old Testament predictions regarding the Messiah (see [Zech 9:9](https://ref.ly/Zech9:9)) and showed that his kingship was not that of a warrior. His gift is life, not conquest.

Among the people drawn to Jesus ([12:19](https://ref.ly/John12:19)) were some Greeks*,* God\-fearing Gentiles who had come to Passover to worship. Jesus’ mission was not simply to Israel but encompassed the entire world ([10:16](https://ref.ly/John10:16); [11:52](https://ref.ly/John11:52)). Following Jesus’ resurrection, the church’s mission was to go beyond Judea to Samaria, and ultimately to the ends of the earth ([Matt 28:19](https://ref.ly/Matt28:19); [Acts 1:8](https://ref.ly/Acts1:8)).

The coming of the Greeks also marked the beginning of the key moment in Jesus’ ministry—the time of his glorification. This occurred when Jesus’ sacrificial work on the cross was completed ([19:30](https://ref.ly/John19:30)), he rose from the dead ([20:1–31](https://ref.ly/John20:1-John20:31)), he gave the Spirit ([20:22](https://ref.ly/John20:22)), and he returned to his place of glory in heaven ([17:5](https://ref.ly/John17:5), [11](https://ref.ly/John17:11)).

When Jesus stood before death, he could not be impassive.

In John, the cross is an event of glory as Christ was “lifted up” ([12:32](https://ref.ly/John12:32)) and glorified there. Jesus was prepared for crucifixion like a king coming to his coronation; the cross was like a throne (see [19:19–22](https://ref.ly/John19:19-John19:22)), and he was buried like royalty. Jesus’ time of glorification included the entire sequence from arrest through resurrection.

The setting is Jesus’ final Passover meal on Thursday evening, when Judas Iscariot betrays Jesus.

Foot washing, common in the Hellenistic and Jewish cultures as a daily routine and as a gesture of hospitality (see [Luke 7:36–50](https://ref.ly/Luke7:36-Luke7:50)), was a lowly, menial task reserved for servants. When Jesus began to wash the disciples’ feet*,* he took the posture of a slave.

## John 13:8 (id: 18922)

Based on the depth of his devotion to Jesus, it is understandable that Peter protested. But Jesus was not simply giving Peter a model of service; this was a symbolic pre\-enactment of his greater act of sacrifice on the cross ([13:7](https://ref.ly/John13:7)). Receiving Jesus’ spiritual cleansing is a condition for discipleship, so if Peter could not accept this act, he could not be Jesus’ disciple at all.

Jesus’ acts of service, such as washing feet and dying on the cross, provided an example of personal sacrifice to follow. • wash each other’s feet: Foot washing was so commonplace that Jesus might have intended a literal repetition of his act, or he might have seen it as symbolic.

I am not saying these things to all of you: The subject of Judas’s betrayal enters the story for the third time ([13:2](https://ref.ly/John13:2), [11](https://ref.ly/John13:11)). The matter weighed heavily on Jesus ([13:21](https://ref.ly/John13:21)). • I know the ones I have chosen: The statement does not imply that Jesus chose only the eleven and that Judas was an outcast. Jesus chose Judas and gave him every opportunity to believe. He realized that Judas had embraced the darkness rather than the light ([6:70](https://ref.ly/John6:70)). • The one who eats my food has turned against me (literally *has lifted his heel against me*): Eating together was a cultural symbol of personal intimacy, which made Judas’s betrayal all the more treacherous.

They even thought that Judas’s departure ([John 13:29](https://ref.ly/John13:29)) fulfilled an official duty for the feast! But Jesus was signaling to Judas that he understood Judas’s plan and was not taken by surprise.

## John 13:31–17.26 (id: 18916)

The Old Testament and later Jewish literature include numerous examples of farewells in which a dying person offers last words to intimate friends (see [Gen 49:1–27](https://ref.ly/Gen49:1-Gen49:27); [Deut 31–34](https://ref.ly/Deut31:1-Deut34:12); [Josh 23–24](https://ref.ly/Josh23:1-Josh24:33); [1 Sam 12](https://ref.ly/1Sam12:1-1Sam12:25); [1 Chr 28:1–29:30](https://ref.ly/1Chr28:1-1Chr29:30)). Such farewells used a standard form. The dying person, surrounded by his loved ones, comforted them and exhorted them to obey the law. He prayed and blessed them and often left behind some writings. In some cases, the departing person passed on his “spirit” to his followers or his successor (see [Num 27:18](https://ref.ly/Num27:18); [Deut 34:9](https://ref.ly/Deut34:9); [2 Kgs 2:9–14](https://ref.ly/2Kgs2:9-2Kgs2:14)).

There is more than enough room in my Father’s home: God’s house is the dwelling place where he resides ([Rev 21:9–22:5](https://ref.ly/Rev21:9-Rev22:5)). The word translated “room” is related to the Greek verb meaning “remain, abide, dwell.” Jesus promises that his followers will have a place to “dwell” alongside him, wherever he is.

Judas, the son of James, whom John is referring to here, is listed as an apostle in [Luke 6:16](https://ref.ly/Luke6:16); he is elsewhere identified as Thaddaeus ([Matt 10:3](https://ref.ly/Matt10:3); [Mark 3:18](https://ref.ly/Mark3:18)). • Lord, why? Judas posed an important question. If Jesus planned to return mightily from death, why not use the opportunity to reveal himself definitively to the world and validate his power and identity?

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 14:22

## John 14:23–24 (id: 18934)

Jesus answered Judas’s question, explaining that his coming would be a profound spiritual revelation beyond the world’s grasp. • Jesus’ coming would occur in three experiences: his resurrection, the coming of the Spirit, and his second coming. When he comes in the Spirit, he and the Father will reside within believers, making a home with each of them (see study note on 14:2).

Jesus promised to send the Holy Spirit (see also [14:16](https://ref.ly/John14:16); [15:26](https://ref.ly/John15:26); [16:7](https://ref.ly/John16:7), [12–14](https://ref.ly/John16:12-John16:14)). • The Spirit will teach . . . everything*,* recalling Jesus’ words and clarifying their meaning. John experienced this power as he wrote his Gospel ([2:22](https://ref.ly/John2:22)); Christians experience this work of the Spirit as they read the Scriptures.

The Jewish greeting peace (Hebrew shalom) captured the spirit of Jesus’ work on earth to restore humanity’s relationship with God ([Isa 9:6–7](https://ref.ly/Isa9:6-Isa9:7); [52:7](https://ref.ly/Isa52:7); [57:19](https://ref.ly/Isa57:19); [Rom 5:1](https://ref.ly/Rom5:1)). The resurrection ([John 14:28](https://ref.ly/John14:28)) and the Spirit were instrumental in achieving this work.

the Father, who is greater than I am: See also [5:19–20](https://ref.ly/John5:19-John5:20). Jesus is submissive to the Father but is also one with the Father ([10:30](https://ref.ly/John10:30)).

I am: See study note on 6:35. The grapevine and the vineyard traditionally represented God’s people, planted and tended by him in Israel ([Ps 80:8–18](https://ref.ly/Ps80:8-Ps80:18); [Isa 5:1–7](https://ref.ly/Isa5:1-Isa5:7); [Jer 2:21](https://ref.ly/Jer2:21); [12:10–11](https://ref.ly/Jer12:10-Jer12:11); [Ezek 15:1–5](https://ref.ly/Ezek15:1-Ezek15:5); [Hos 10:1–2](https://ref.ly/Hos10:1-Hos10:2)).

## John 15:1–27 (id: 18944)

Jesus prepared his disciples for his departure, instructing them to remain in close fellowship with him. The image of a grapevine illustrates both intimacy and fruitfulness. To sustain genuine spiritual life in the world, believers must remain intimately connected to Christ.

## John 15:4 (id: 18957)

The term remain (Greek menō) is key to understanding [15:4–10](https://ref.ly/John15:4-John15:10). A growing disciple, in whom the Father and the Son live through the Spirit, must be continuously connected to Christ (see [14:16–25](https://ref.ly/John14:16-John14:25); [15:26](https://ref.ly/John15:26)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 15:4

## John 15:6 (id: 18958)

Anyone who does not remain in Christ is separated from the vine and its life. A living branch produces clusters of grapes ([15:5](https://ref.ly/John15:5)). Connection with the vine allows the life of Jesus to flow fruitfully through the disciple. Those who claim to be attached to Christ but yield no fruit are useless and will be burned.

If the darkness is opposed to the light ([1:5](https://ref.ly/John1:5)), and if Jesus’ followers are bearers of that light in the world ([1 Jn 1:7](https://ref.ly/1John1:7); [2:9](https://ref.ly/1John2:9)), they should expect the world to hate them in the way it hated Jesus (see [John 17:14](https://ref.ly/John17:14)).

Jesus had outlined the coming conflicts ([15:18–25](https://ref.ly/John15:18-John15:25)) so that the disciples would not abandon their faith (literally *be caused to stumble*). The greatest obstacle his disciples would face was to stumble and renounce their faith before their opponents (see [Matt 23:34](https://ref.ly/Matt23:34); [Luke 6:22](https://ref.ly/Luke6:22)), especially during the dark days ahead (see [John 12:35](https://ref.ly/John12:35); [1 Jn 2:9–11](https://ref.ly/1John2:9-1John2:11)).

One of the Spirit’s roles is to convict the world. Convict is a legal term: The world had conducted its trial of Jesus, examining the evidence for his case (his signs and claims). Now the world would stand trial before the Spirit, and its guilt would be proven.

This title—unusual in Judaism—reflected Jesus’ intimacy with God. • This hour included Jesus’ betrayal, arrest, torture, death, and resurrection (see study note on 12:23). • Glorify your Son: In the Gospel of John, the cross is a place of honor.

John’s full description of the arresting party expands the picture from the other Gospels. The Temple authorities sent Roman soldiers and Temple guards*;* while the Temple guards made the arrest, the Roman detachment stood by to prevent a riot. The Roman detachment was large enough to warrant a commander ([18:12](https://ref.ly/John18:12)) and came armed, anticipating a struggle ([18:10](https://ref.ly/John18:10)). Numerous men had claimed to be the Messiah, and often they had made politically explosive attempts to expel the Romans.

## John 18:5 (id: 19017)

I Am he (literally *I am*): Jesus identified himself by the divine name God had revealed to Moses on Mount Sinai (see [Exod 3:14](https://ref.ly/Exod3:14); see also [John 4:26](https://ref.ly/John4:26); [8:24](https://ref.ly/John8:24), [58](https://ref.ly/John8:58)).

## John 18:6 (id: 19018)

The soldiers and guards all drew back before the Lord (cp. [Isa 6:5](https://ref.ly/Isa6:5); [Ezek 1:28](https://ref.ly/Ezek1:28); [Dan 10:9](https://ref.ly/Dan10:9); [Acts 9:4](https://ref.ly/Acts9:4); [Rev 1:17](https://ref.ly/Rev1:17)). Even Roman soldiers, who were trained not to fall, fell to the ground before Christ. Although they took this posture of submission, they didn’t really understand what had occurred and proceeded with the arrest.

## John 18:9 (id: 19020)

I did not lose a single one: Jesus continued to be a good shepherd, offering his life for the sheep and protecting them from the wolves ([10:11–15](https://ref.ly/John10:11-John10:15)). From the beginning, however, Judas Iscariot had not been a true disciple of Jesus ([17:12](https://ref.ly/John17:12)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 18:9

## John 18:10–11 (id: 18998)

Simon Peter drew a short sword or a long knife that was generally worn with everyday garments. • The Hebrew name Malchus means “king,” a detail that John might have included for its wordplay on Jesus’ true identity (see [18:36–37](https://ref.ly/John18:36-John18:37); [19:19](https://ref.ly/John19:19)). • Put your sword back: Jesus’ mission was not to fight for his life, but to die for ours.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 18:10–JHN 18:11

## John 18:12–14 (id: 18999)

Jesus was bound by the soldiers and returned to Jerusalem. • First they took him to Annas*,* who had been the high priest and remained highly influential (five of his sons also became high priests). Caiaphas*,* his son\-in\-law, was the official high priest at that time (see [18:24](https://ref.ly/John18:24)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 18:12–JHN 18:14

## John 18:14 (id: 19000)

one man should die for the people: Caiaphas had previously made this political analysis ([11:49–50](https://ref.ly/John11:49-John11:50)). John points out the irony of this statement. Jesus’ death did not bring Israel political salvation—it brought spiritual salvation to all who believe.

## John 18:16–17 (id: 19002)

During Jesus’ interrogation by Annas ([18:12–14](https://ref.ly/John18:12-John18:14), [19–24](https://ref.ly/John18:19-John18:24)), the woman watching at the gate asked Peter if he was one of that man’s disciples. In contrast to Jesus, who stood up to his questioners and denied nothing, Peter quickly denied his link to Jesus three times ([18:17](https://ref.ly/John18:17), [25](https://ref.ly/John18:25), [27](https://ref.ly/John18:27)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 18:16–JHN 18:17

## John 18:19 (id: 19003)

The high priest began asking Jesus questions, but his inquiry was contrary to Jewish legal procedure. In Jewish court, the priest did not ask questions directly of the defendant but accumulated evidence from witnesses to establish guilt (see [Num 35:30](https://ref.ly/Num35:30); [Deut 17:6](https://ref.ly/Deut17:6); [19:15](https://ref.ly/Deut19:15); cp. [Matt 18:16](https://ref.ly/Matt18:16)). If Jesus said anything incriminating, Annas would later use it to testify against him at Jesus’ trial. He was attempting to follow Roman practice by making Jesus incriminate himself, rather than gathering evidence through witnesses as Jewish law demanded.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 18:19

## John 18:20–21 (id: 19004)

Jesus’ sharp answer, reminding Annas that everything was in the public record, unmasked the priest’s attempt to follow Roman practice.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 18:20–JHN 18:21

## John 18:22–23 (id: 19005)

When Jesus reminded Annas of correct judicial procedure, one of the Temple guards viewed it as insolence and slapped Jesus. However, Jesus knew the law and represented it truthfully. No witnesses were accusing him, and no evidence was being presented.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 18:22–JHN 18:23

## John 18:24 (id: 19006)

Annas was at an impasse—his probing had been unsuccessful. So he sent Jesus to Caiaphas to be prosecuted before the Sanhedrin, Jerusalem’s judicial high council (see [Mark 14:53–15:1](https://ref.ly/Mark14:53-Mark15:1)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 18:24

## John 18:25–27 (id: 19007)

He denied it: Peter’s three denials were later echoed when Jesus invited him three times to reaffirm his love ([21:15–17](https://ref.ly/John21:15-John21:17)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 18:25–JHN 18:27

## John 18:28 (id: 19008)

The trial before Caiaphas ended in the early hours of the morning. Since they did not have the power of capital punishment ([18:31](https://ref.ly/John18:31)), the Sanhedrin needed to enlist Pilate, the Roman governor, to carry out an execution. • it would defile them: They did not want to become ritually unclean by contact with Gentiles in Pilate’s headquarters. So Pilate, probably fearing a riot, went outside to meet them. • The Passover meal itself had occurred the night before (see [13:1](https://ref.ly/John13:1); [Mark 14:14–16](https://ref.ly/Mark14:14-Mark14:16)). The following day, another meal began the weeklong Festival of Unleavened Bread ([Lev 23:5–6](https://ref.ly/Lev23:5-Lev23:6)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 18:28

## John 18:29 (id: 19009)

Pilate*,* the fifth Roman governor of Judea, ruled the country from AD 26 to 36\. He usually lived on the coast in Caesarea, but kept troops stationed in a fortress in Jerusalem where he appeared personally for major festivals. He was a brutal ruler whose atrocities against the Jews were legendary (e.g., [Luke 13:1](https://ref.ly/Luke13:1); Josephus, *War* 2\.9\.2–4\).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 18:29

## John 18:31–32 (id: 19010)

Pilate found the charges unsatisfying and told the Sanhedrin, judge him by your own law. Pilate saw this as a Jewish squabble, which he refused to investigate. The Jewish leaders, however, insisted that an execution was necessary. • fulfilled Jesus’ prediction about the way he would die (see [12:32–33](https://ref.ly/John12:32-John12:33)): The Jews would have employed stoning; the Romans used crucifixion. If Pilate delivered Jesus’ sentence, he would be crucified.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 18:31–JHN 18:32

## John 18:33 (id: 19011)

Pilate was personally responsible for capital crimes in which the interests and security of the Roman Empire were at stake, so he began his formal legal inquiry. • Are you the king of the Jews? To get the governor’s attention, Caiaphas had charged that Jesus had urged people not to pay their taxes to the Roman government and had claimed to be a king ([Luke 23:2](https://ref.ly/Luke23:2)). To Pilate, Jesus might have been just another Jewish terrorist–revolutionary (see [Luke 23:18–19](https://ref.ly/Luke23:18-Luke23:19); [Acts 5:36–37](https://ref.ly/Acts5:36-Acts5:37)) with a head full of messianic notions and a band of well\-armed followers.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 18:33

## John 18:34–35 (id: 19012)

Jesus’ reply forced the governor to show the origin of his question. The Temple leadership was behind these charges. Pilate only wanted to know if Jesus was a rebel who might threaten Roman interests.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 18:34–JHN 18:35

## John 18:36–37 (id: 19013)

Jesus was willing to accept the title of king*,* but he made it clear that he did not govern an earthly kingdom that might rival Rome. Jesus’ kingship is not of this world. Rather than being a political ruler, he rules through the devotion and obedience of his followers.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 18:36–JHN 18:37

## John 18:38–39 (id: 19014)

What is truth? Truth was not a foreign idea to Pilate, but he did not wait for an answer to his question because he did not believe there was one. • Pilate returned to the council members waiting outside and delivered his verdict: not guilty. Although he referred to Jesus as “King of the Jews” (see also [19:19](https://ref.ly/John19:19)), the title meant nothing more to Pilate than a mocking expression of contempt. Pilate’s offer of amnesty revealed his desire to let Jesus go.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 18:38–JHN 18:39

## John 18:40 (id: 19016)

Jesus was no threat to Rome, but Barabbas was a revolutionary*,* a violent man who took part in political uprisings (see [Luke 23:19](https://ref.ly/Luke23:19)), with a proven capacity to challenge the Roman military occupation of Israel.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 18:40

## John 19:1–16 (id: 19021)

Jesus was also beaten after his sentencing ([Mark 15:15](https://ref.ly/Mark15:15)), but here John records an earlier beating, which was likely Pilate’s attempt to show that Jesus had been punished and could be released ([John 19:4](https://ref.ly/John19:4)). When this failed, Pilate passed his sentence and handed Jesus over to the Jewish leaders for crucifixion ([19:16](https://ref.ly/John19:16)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 19:1–JHN 19:16

## John 19:2 (id: 19035)

The crown of thorns might have come from a date palm (cp. [12:13–14](https://ref.ly/John12:13-John12:14)), the thorns of which can exceed twelve inches. There are Greek coin images showing such crowns, with the stems woven and the thorns radiating upward above the crown. • The purple robe was probably a soldier’s robe—dark red to complete the picture of mock royalty.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 19:2

## John 19:4–6 (id: 19044)

Pilate’s intention was to bring Jesus out to display the marks of his punishment to sway the crowd to let him go. After being flogged with a lead\-tipped whip, Jesus was bleeding profusely. • Pilate announced his verdict of not guilty a second time, but he was met with a strident call for Jesus’ death ([19:6](https://ref.ly/John19:6)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 19:4–JHN 19:6

## John 19:6 (id: 19047)

Pilate knew that a riot could happen when a man popular with the masses was executed, so he shifted responsibility to crucify Jesus to the Temple leaders.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 19:6

## John 19:7 (id: 19048)

During the trial before Caiaphas, the charge of blasphemy—calling himself the Son of God—was determined to be Jesus’ true crime (see [Mark 14:61–65](https://ref.ly/Mark14:61-Mark14:65)). • The leaders had already tried pitting Jesus against Roman imperial interests ([John 18:33](https://ref.ly/John18:33)), and would do so again ([19:12](https://ref.ly/John19:12)). Now they challenged the governor on another level: Pilate must keep the peace by upholding local law*,* even when it was irrelevant to Rome. Claiming to be God’s son was not illegal, because Israel’s kings did this ([Pss 2:7](https://ref.ly/Ps2:7); [89:22–27](https://ref.ly/Ps89:22-Ps89:27)). However, Jesus claimed to have the divine authority of God himself (see [John 5:18](https://ref.ly/John5:18)), which they saw as blasphemy.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 19:7

## John 19:8–9 (id: 19049)

Pilate . . . was more frightened than ever: He was superstitious, and the idea of gods appearing in the world was not uncommon ([Acts 14:11](https://ref.ly/Acts14:11)). He sensed that more than a political fight was going on, so he asked Jesus, Where are you from? He did not mean Jesus’ birthplace, but whether Jesus was a divine man who had descended from heaven. • Why Jesus gave no answer is unclear. Perhaps it was because Pilate would not have been able to understand the answer—that true power comes only from God, and God had empowered Jesus (cp. [John 19:11](https://ref.ly/John19:11)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 19:8–JHN 19:9

## John 19:10–11 (id: 19022)

You would have no power over me: Although Pilate had the power to . . . crucify Jesus, it was only because God had given him this temporary power so Jesus could advance toward the cross (see [10:18](https://ref.ly/John10:18)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 19:10–JHN 19:11

## John 19:12 (id: 19023)

Each time he had a conversation with Jesus, Pilate tried to release him: He kept trying, but his repeated efforts were fruitless. • “Friend of Caesar” was an official title given to individuals such as senators who showed exceptional loyalty and service to the emperor. The Jewish leaders were implying that they would ruin Pilate’s career by reporting that he was not working in Rome’s interests. They probably knew that Pilate was also having a personal crisis. His patron in Rome, Sejanus (the chief administrator of the empire under Tiberius Caesar), had fallen from favor and was executed in AD 31\. Pilate had every reason to be afraid.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 19:12

## John 19:13 (id: 19024)

Pilate took the governor’s judgment seat (Greek bēma*,* cp. [Acts 25:6](https://ref.ly/Acts25:6), “seat in court”) to render his verdict. • The Stone Pavement was the platform holding the judgment seat; from there Pilate now spoke with the authority of his office.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 19:13

## John 19:14 (id: 19025)

the day of preparation for the Passover (or *the day of preparation during the Passover*): Here, Passover does not refer to the Jewish Passover meal, which had taken place the night before, but to the whole Festival of Unleavened Bread. It was now Friday, the day of preparation for the Passover Sabbath, which would begin at sundown (cp. [Mark 15:42](https://ref.ly/Mark15:42); [Luke 23:54](https://ref.ly/Luke23:54)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 19:14

## John 19:15 (id: 19026)

The final words of the priests, “We have no king but Caesar,” stood in direct contradiction to the Old Testament understanding that God was Israel’s king (cp. [Judg 8:23](https://ref.ly/Judg8:23); [1 Sam 8:7](https://ref.ly/1Sam8:7); [10:19](https://ref.ly/1Sam10:19)). Jerusalem and its leaders were in the process of killing their true king ([John 18:37](https://ref.ly/John18:37)) while paying homage to Caesar, the pagan king of Rome.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 19:15

## John 19:16 (id: 19027)

Pilate turned Jesus over to the Roman garrison, who prepared Jesus for crucifixion by a second flogging ([Mark 15:15](https://ref.ly/Mark15:15)), which brought him near death. Bleeding profusely, his clothes soaked in blood, his thorn\-laced crown now digging deeply into his head, and nearly in shock, Jesus was marched to a site outside the city.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 19:16

## John 19:17 (id: 19028)

The vertical beam (Latin *staticulum*) of the cross was generally kept at the crucifixion site, and the victim was forced to carry only the heavy crossbeam (Latin *patibulum*). • Crucifixions were public executions that took place near major roadways. They were designed to shock and warn the people. • Place of the Skull (Hebrew and Aramaic *Golgotha;* Latin *calvariae,* “Calvary”): Most archaeologists agree that Jesus’ crucifixion was at the site of the present\-day Church of the Holy Sepulchre, located in the Christian Quarter of the old walled city of Jerusalem. An alternate site, Gordon’s Calvary (north of the Damascus Gate), provides a model of what the scene possibly looked like, but it holds only a tomb from the 500s BC and therefore is unlikely to be the authentic site of Jesus’ crucifixion and burial.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 19:17

## John 19:18 (id: 19029)

None of the Gospel writers dwell on the details of being nailed . . . to the cross because they were well known and horrific. The soldiers used the cross as a means of torture; they wanted victims to survive for a while, in some cases for days. Because the Sabbath would begin at dusk ([19:31](https://ref.ly/John19:31)), they expedited Jesus’ crucifixion. Jesus had been thoroughly beaten with stone\- or metal\-tipped whips, so his back was thoroughly lacerated, and he was bleeding profusely.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 19:18

## John 19:19–22 (id: 19030)

Pilate posted a sign on the cross: It was customary for the Roman soldiers to provide a written public notice of the criminal’s name and crimes. Perhaps as a final act of revenge against the Jewish high council, Pilate ordered that the sign should identify Jesus of Nazareth as the King of the Jews. Jesus’ kingship was posted in three languages for the whole world to understand.

This is the only reference to Jesus’ mother’s sister in the New Testament. She might have been the wife of Zebedee and the mother of James and John (cp. [Matt 27:56](https://ref.ly/Matt27:56)), which would make Jesus and John cousins. If so, it would help explain why Jesus assigned the disciple he loved (John) to care for Mary (John’s aunt). • Mary (the wife of Clopas) is only mentioned here. She might be the same person as Mary the mother of James and Joseph (cp. [Matt 27:56](https://ref.ly/Matt27:56)). • Jesus had healed Mary Magdalene*,* a woman from the village of Magdala ([Mark 16:9](https://ref.ly/Mark16:9); [Luke 8:2](https://ref.ly/Luke8:2)). • Dear woman was a formal and polite form of address (see [John 2:4](https://ref.ly/John2:4)).

## John 19:27 (id: 19033)

Here is your mother: Jesus employed a Jewish family law that assigned the care of one person to another. The scene had an additional significance: The people who were present represented the new community of the church that was born at the cross. Jesus wanted them to care for each other in obedience to his command to love one another ([13:34](https://ref.ly/John13:34); [15:12](https://ref.ly/John15:12), [17](https://ref.ly/John15:17)).

The hyssop bush had been used in Egypt to brush lamb’s blood on the doorposts and lintels during the first Passover ([Exod 12:22](https://ref.ly/Exod12:22)). Jesus is God’s Passover lamb ([John 1:29](https://ref.ly/John1:29), [36](https://ref.ly/John1:36)), and his blood likewise saves.

## John 19:31–33 (id: 19037)

The Jewish authorities, eager to complete the crucifixion before Sabbath began at dusk, asked Pilate to break the legs of the men. Breaking the legs with a mallet was common: It promoted asphyxiation and hemorrhaging, because the victim could no longer push up to breathe.

## John 19:34 (id: 19038)

To confirm that Jesus was dead, a Roman soldier pierced his side with a spear. • blood and water flowed out: This has several levels of meaning: (1\) The spear probably punctured Jesus’ pericardium, the sac around the heart, releasing these fluids. (2\) John might have been thinking of more Passover symbolism. The Passover lamb’s blood had to flow as it died. (3\) The water flowing from Jesus’ side reminds readers of the language of living water that Jesus had used earlier (see [4:10–14](https://ref.ly/John4:10-John4:14); [7:37–39](https://ref.ly/John7:37-John7:39)).

## John 19:35 (id: 19039)

John was at the foot of the cross ([19:26](https://ref.ly/John19:26)). He was not simply a collector of traditions about Jesus, but an eyewitness giving an accurate account of the events of Jesus’ life (cp. [21:24](https://ref.ly/John21:24)).

According to Luke, Joseph of Arimathea was a courageous man who was waiting for the Kingdom of God ([Luke 23:50–51](https://ref.ly/Luke23:50-Luke23:51)). He was a wealthy ([Matt 27:57](https://ref.ly/Matt27:57)) and influential leader in Jerusalem and a member of the high council ([Mark 15:43](https://ref.ly/Mark15:43)) who disagreed with the decision to kill Jesus. He asked Pilate for the favor of burying Jesus in his personal tomb. • Joseph was a secret disciple (cp.

Nicodemus (see [3:1](https://ref.ly/John3:1); [7:50](https://ref.ly/John7:50)), a member of the high council, understood that these bodies had to be buried before the upcoming Sabbath ([19:31](https://ref.ly/John19:31), [42](https://ref.ly/John19:42)). His public support, as with Joseph of Arimathea, might indicate that he, too, was becoming a disciple (see study note on 7:49–51). • Myrrh was a commonly used aromatic powder. • The aloes were fragrant powdered sandalwood often used as perfume. • seventy\-five pounds: This enormous amount of spices was appropriate for royalty; Jesus, the king, was given a royal burial.

The other disciple was probably John, “the disciple Jesus loved” and author of this Gospel (see [13:23](https://ref.ly/John13:23)). He and Peter validated Mary’s testimony by examining the tomb for themselves. John arrived first, but Peter entered first.

What Peter and John found in the tomb was remarkable. The linen wrappings ([19:40](https://ref.ly/John19:40)) were on the burial bench. Jews also used a facial cloth for burials (cp. [11:44](https://ref.ly/John11:44)), which was rolled, wrapped under the chin, and tied on the top of the head. The apostles found this face cloth folded up on the bench. John’s inclusion of these details counters any suggestion that grave robbers had taken Jesus’ body; such costly garments would have been stolen in a robbery.

## John 20:11–13 (id: 19063)

Although two . . . angels appeared inside the tomb, the riddle of Jesus’ disappearance remained unsolved (see [Luke 24:4](https://ref.ly/Luke24:4)). • why are you crying? Sorrow was not the appropriate response in this moment.

## John 20:14–15 (id: 19064)

Jesus, whom Mary mistook for the gardener*,* repeated the angel’s question and added, Who are you looking for? Jesus’ question was to provoke Mary’s thinking: At this point Mary was looking for the body of Jesus, but she was about to meet the living Christ.

## John 20:17 (id: 19066)

Mary thought that with the resurrection, Jesus would resume normal relations with his disciples. She was trying to cling to the joy she discovered in her resurrected Lord. But his fellowship with her would come in a new form ([20:22](https://ref.ly/John20:22)). Jesus had not yet ascended to complete his return to the Father, but the process was underway. Before his final departure, he would give the Holy Spirit ([20:22](https://ref.ly/John20:22); see [14:15–21](https://ref.ly/John14:15-John14:21), [26](https://ref.ly/John14:26); [15:26–27](https://ref.ly/John15:26-John15:27); [16:5–15](https://ref.ly/John16:5-John16:15)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 20:17

## John 20:18 (id: 19067)

Mary was the first eyewitness to see the Lord following his resurrection. She not only saw him, she heard him and touched him (see [1 Jn 1:1–4](https://ref.ly/1John1:1-1John1:4)). This great privilege was given to a woman whose broken life had experienced healing ([Luke 8:2](https://ref.ly/Luke8:2)). In Jewish culture this was astounding; a woman could not even be a witness in court. No Jew in this period would make up such a story.

meeting behind locked doors: The disciples feared prosecution for following Jesus. • Peace be with you: This was a standard Jewish greeting (see also [3 Jn 1:15](https://ref.ly/3John1:15)), but Jesus was doing more than just greeting his disciples: he was offering the Messiah’s peace (see [Isa 9:6](https://ref.ly/Isa9:6); [52:7](https://ref.ly/Isa52:7)) and delivering the gift of his Kingdom (see [John 14:27](https://ref.ly/John14:27); [16:33](https://ref.ly/John16:33)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 20:19

## John 20:20 (id: 19070)

The reality of Jesus’ resurrection was quite clear. Jesus showed them the wounds from the nails and the spear. He did not feign death but conquered it. He was no phantom but a real man with a real body. He had been dead but was now alive. Jesus was fully human both in life ([1:14](https://ref.ly/John1:14)) and in his resurrection.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 20:20

## John 20:21 (id: 19071)

I am sending you: God had sent Jesus into the world to establish his Kingdom, and now Jesus was sending his disciples to carry on his mission. Christ’s emissaries carry the truth of Jesus’ words to the world (cp. [17:18](https://ref.ly/John17:18)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 20:21

## John 20:22 (id: 19072)

Jesus commissioned the disciples and then empowered them with the Holy Spirit. The Spirit had not been given previously because Jesus had not yet been glorified ([7:39](https://ref.ly/John7:39)). The glorified Jesus, resplendent in his resurrected body, poured the Spirit on his followers. This gift fulfilled many promises that the Spirit would be sent ([14:16](https://ref.ly/John14:16), [26](https://ref.ly/John14:26); [15:26](https://ref.ly/John15:26); [16:7](https://ref.ly/John16:7), [13](https://ref.ly/John16:13)). It foreshadows the arrival of the Spirit’s empowering presence at Pentecost ([Acts 1:4–5](https://ref.ly/Acts1:4-Acts1:5); [2:1–47](https://ref.ly/Acts2:1-Acts2:47)).

## John 20:23 (id: 19073)

If you forgive anyone’s sins: The ongoing work of Christ’s followers parallels the work of Christ. Christ’s followers do not distribute and withdraw God’s forgiveness on a whim, but they follow Jesus’ prompting through the Spirit ([15:5](https://ref.ly/John15:5)), just as Jesus obeyed his Father ([14:31](https://ref.ly/John14:31)).

Thomas: See also [11:16](https://ref.ly/John11:16); [14:5](https://ref.ly/John14:5)). Thomas was absent when Jesus revealed himself. He remained skeptical despite the testimony of his friends, who had seen the Lord. Thomas demanded a concrete experience identical to theirs.

## John 20:26–27 (id: 19075)

Eight days later was Sunday, one week after Jesus’ resurrection (it was customary to include the current day when counting forward). Jesus’ appearance on the following Sunday helps explain the disciples’ meeting on “the Lord’s Day” (see [Rev 1:10](https://ref.ly/Rev1:10)). • Peace be with you: This scene was exactly like Jesus’ first appearance ([John 20:19–20](https://ref.ly/John20:19-John20:20)). Jesus had already heard Thomas’s complaint and now answered directly. • Believe! Jesus challenged Thomas to believe in the resurrection like the others.

## John 20:28 (id: 19076)

“My Lord and my God!” This was not an astonished exclamation but a proclamation of heartfelt belief. It concludes John’s declaration of Jesus’ deity that has framed the whole book (see [1:1–18](https://ref.ly/John1:1-John1:18)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 20:28

Many scholars view these words as the conclusion of John’s Gospel, viewing ch[21](https://ref.ly/John21:1-John21:25) as an appendix. John’s account is only a selection from Jesus’ many . . . miraculous signs.

that you may continue to believe: The present tense (found in some manuscripts) indicates that John wrote to encourage believers. Other manuscripts read *that you may \[come to] believe,* suggesting that John wrote to stimulate new faith (cp. [1:7](https://ref.ly/John1:7)).

This final chapter adds an account about the resurrected Jesus in Galilee ([21:1–14](https://ref.ly/John21:1-John21:14)) and records the exchange between Peter and Jesus concerning Peter’s love ([21:15–23](https://ref.ly/John21:15-John21:23)). The chapter ends by summarizing the authority and importance of John’s eyewitness report ([21:24–25](https://ref.ly/John21:24-John21:25)).

## John 21:2 (id: 19097)

Several of the disciples returned to fishing in the Sea of Galilee. This was not a sign that their faith had weakened—even rabbis who regularly preached kept practicing their occupations (see [Acts 18:3](https://ref.ly/Acts18:3); [20:34](https://ref.ly/Acts20:34); [1 Cor 4:12](https://ref.ly/1Cor4:12)). • The sons of Zebedee were James and John (see [Matt 4:21](https://ref.ly/Matt4:21)).

Jesus was standing on the beach*,* but the men did not recognize him (cp. [20:11–16](https://ref.ly/John20:11-John20:16); [Luke 24:13–53](https://ref.ly/Luke24:13-Luke24:53)).

## John 21:6 (id: 19100)

“Throw out your net on the right\-hand side”: Casting a net into the sea at random was futile. But when they did as the stranger said, the immense catch was immediate ([21:11](https://ref.ly/John21:11)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 21:6

## John 21:7 (id: 19101)

“It’s the Lord!” John recognized Jesus, probably remembering that a miracle like this had happened before ([Luke 5:1–11](https://ref.ly/Luke5:1-Luke5:11)). • Peter, who had stripped off his clothes while working, put on his tunic in order to meet the Lord.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 21:7

## John 21:9 (id: 19102)

Cooked fish and bread were the mainstays of the Galilean diet; Jesus provided the men with breakfast. The charcoal fire is reminiscent of the scene of Peter’s denials ([18:18](https://ref.ly/John18:18)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 21:9

## John 21:11 (id: 19085)

This miracle showed generous provision (as in [2:1–12](https://ref.ly/John2:1-John2:12); [6:1–15](https://ref.ly/John6:1-John6:15)). No symbolism attaches to the number 153\.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 21:11

## John 21:12–13 (id: 19086)

None of the disciples dared to ask him, “Who are you?” Jesus’ resurrected appearance was different. His offer of fish and bread removed all uncertainties (cp. [6:11](https://ref.ly/John6:11); [Luke 24:30](https://ref.ly/Luke24:30)).

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 21:12–JHN 21:13

This scene on the beach was the third time Jesus had appeared (see [20:11–23](https://ref.ly/John20:11-John20:23), [26–29](https://ref.ly/John20:26-John20:29)).

more than these? Or *more than these others do?* Jesus was reminding Peter of his insistence that he would be more faithful and courageous than the others ([13:37](https://ref.ly/John13:37); [Matt 26:33](https://ref.ly/Matt26:33); [Mark 14:29](https://ref.ly/Mark14:29)). He was urging Peter to examine himself.

## John 21:15–17 (id: 19088)

do you love me? The three questions and affirmations mirror Peter’s three denials ([18:15–18](https://ref.ly/John18:15-John18:18), [25–27](https://ref.ly/John18:25-John18:27)). Jesus invited Peter to reaffirm everything he had denied. • The Greek term translated love in Jesus’ first two questions (agapaō) is different from the word in his third question (phileō). In each case, Peter answered with the second word (phileō). Most Greek scholars view the two words as synonyms in this situation. The focus of Jesus’ exchange with Peter was not the quality of Peter’s love, but Peter’s commission to take care of Jesus’ flock. Peter might be meditating on these events in [1 Pet 5:2–4](https://ref.ly/1Pet5:2-1Pet5:4).

## John 21:19 (id: 19092)

The rest of Peter’s life was a ministry tending the flock of God, and his martyrdom was a kind of death that glorifies God. • Follow me: This might require suffering and death (see [13:16](https://ref.ly/John13:16); [15:18–21](https://ref.ly/John15:18-John15:21)).

## John 21:20–22 (id: 19093)

“What about him, Lord?” Peter asked Jesus about the fate of John, wondering if he, too, would experience martyrdom. Jesus’ answer was abrupt: It was not Peter’s business to know how or when John would die. Peter’s only task was to follow Jesus, which John was already doing. This episode forms the core of John’s concept of discipleship: What matters most for the disciple of Jesus is to follow him and do his will, come what may.

* **Associated Passages:** JHN 21:20–JHN 21:22

## John 21:23 (id: 19094)

Jesus’ words to Peter spread, causing some to conclude that John would not die until Jesus returned in his second coming. Jesus’ rebuke to Peter ([21:22](https://ref.ly/John21:22)) is repeated to answer that rumor. Those among the community of believers who believed this rumor were thus instructed to abandon any speculation about John. According to tradition, John died peacefully in Ephesus at an old age, surrounded by fellow believers.

This disciple is the one who testifies . . . and has recorded: John’s Gospel is anchored in his personal experiences. It is not a story written from hearsay or speculation, but from the remembrance of a man who spent life\-changing years with Jesus and recalled, with the help of the Holy Spirit ([14:26](https://ref.ly/John14:26)), what Jesus said and did. • we know: This account of the life of Christ was not speculation or weak reminiscence. Rather, it was based on the confident knowledge of reliable eyewitness accounts.

## John 21:25 (id: 19096)

the whole world could not contain the books: John ends his Gospel acknowledging that the story he has described is larger than anything he can imagine or fully communicate. Though it is glorious for us to read, John’s account pales in comparison to the glory of the person it describes.
