## Hosea 1:1 (id: 13362)

The Lord gave this message: The book of Hosea begins by declaring that these are not merely human words but a message from the only true God (cp. [Joel 1:1](https://ref.ly/Joel1:1); [Mic 1:1](https://ref.ly/Mic1:1); [Zeph 1:1](https://ref.ly/Zeph1:1)). • Hosea son of Beeri: Several other important people in the Old Testament are also named Hosea (or Hoshea; both are spelled the same in Hebrew; [Num 13:8](https://ref.ly/Num13:8); [2 Kgs 17:1](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:1)). Hosea means “the Lord saves,” an appropriate name for this prophet. • Jeroboam … king of Israel: Hosea prophesied to the northern kingdom of Israel during the reigns of its last seven kings, though only one of them, Jeroboam II, is listed here (see Hosea Book Introduction, “Setting”).

## Hosea 1:2–3 (id: 13364)

a prostitute: Some have found it impossible to believe that God would command a prophet to marry a prostitute. As a result, there is a long tradition of interpreting this passage symbolically. Many in the early church believed that the marriage did not actually take place. They thought that this passage was an allegory in which Hosea represented the Lord and Gomer represented Israel. Today, most interpreters regard the marriage as a real one, but they differ in their ideas about Gomer’s occupation prior to the marriage. Some suggest that Gomer was an ordinary prostitute, while others suggest that she was one of the sacred prostitutes involved in Canaanite fertility worship. Another possibility is that Gomer was a young woman who had not previously participated in illicit sexual activity, but whom God knew to be predisposed toward adultery and prostitution.

## Hosea 1:7 (id: 13368)

For many years, the kingdom of Israel had depended upon its armies and horses and charioteers for security, but its confidence was completely misplaced. Safety and security are only to be found in God’s power as the Lord.

* **Associated Passages:** HOS 1:7
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Hosea 1:9 (id: 13369)

The name Lo\-ammi carries the harshest judgment of all, because it seems to announce the end of Israel’s covenant relationship with the Lord. The cherished title my people—bestowed upon Israel when they lived obediently in covenant with the Lord their God ([Lev 26:12](https://ref.ly/Lev26:12); see also [Exod 6:7](https://ref.ly/Exod6:7))—was now withdrawn due to their blatant unfaithfulness. • I am not their God: The Hebrew behind this declaration can be translated *I am not ‘*I Am*’ for you* (cp. [Exod 3:14](https://ref.ly/Exod3:14)). The third child’s name prophetically announces that the Israelites stand outside the covenant and are no longer privileged to call upon the I Am.

sands of the seashore: This promise of future population growth for God’s people echoes the promise given to the patriarchs Abraham and Jacob ([Gen 22:17](https://ref.ly/Gen22:17); [32:12](https://ref.ly/Gen32:12)). • You are children of the living God: This expression is found nowhere else in the Old Testament, but Paul quoted this verse ([Rom 9:26](https://ref.ly/Rom9:26)) to establish that God had also called the Gentiles to salvation.

## Hosea 1:10–11 (id: 13359)

These verses mark an abrupt shift in Hosea’s prophecy from judgment to hope. In the next three verses, Hosea transforms the names of Gomer’s three children from names of divine punishment on Israel into names of blessing and hope. This dramatically demonstrates God’s sovereign power of reversal from darkness to light, judgment to hope, and even death to life.

## Hosea 1:11 (id: 13361)

Judah and Israel will unite together: For almost 200 years, Israel and Judah had been divided into separate kingdoms by political rivalry. When God restores his people, he will reunite the divided kingdoms under a single leader as in the time of David, and he will reverse the curse of exile (see also [Ezek 37:15–28](https://ref.ly/Ezek37:15-Ezek37:28)). • The day of Jezreel: Hosea announced that in a coming time, God would restore the original meaning of Jezreel. It would signify blessing and growth rather than judgment.

bring charges against Israel: At first glance, the Lord, as the aggrieved husband, appears to be issuing a bill of divorce against his unfaithful spouse, Israel (see [Deut 24:1](https://ref.ly/Deut24:1)). As the passage continues, however, it becomes clear that God’s purpose in this lawsuit is not divorce, but reconciliation ([Hos 2:14–23](https://ref.ly/Hos2:14-Hos2:23)). God’s case against Israel is intended to awaken Israel to her sin and offer her a chance to return to her true husband. The Lord’s desire for reconciliation with Israel is all the more surprising inasmuch as the law stipulated the death penalty for an adulterous spouse ([Deut 22:22](https://ref.ly/Deut22:22); see also [Gen 38:24](https://ref.ly/Gen38:24); [Lev 21:9](https://ref.ly/Lev21:9)).

## Hosea 2:3 (id: 13429)

The Lord warns unfaithful Israel that unless she repents and returns to her covenant partner, he will strip her … naked (see also [2:10](https://ref.ly/Hos2:10)). Ezekiel also employs this image of judgment and shame ([Ezek 16:36–37](https://ref.ly/Ezek16:36-Ezek16:37)).

* **Associated Passages:** HOS 2:3
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Hosea 2:5 (id: 13430)

The only evidence needed to prove Israel’s unfaithfulness comes from her own words: I’ll run after other lovers. Israel’s lovers were the Canaanite fertility deities, especially the baals (local representations of Baal). The Israelites worshiped them because they believed that these gods controlled the reproductive forces in nature. The Israelites attributed to them the basic necessities of life, food and water*,* their clothing of wool and linen*,* and oil*,* used for both sacred and secular purposes.

* **Associated Passages:** HOS 2:5
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Hosea 2:6–7 (id: 13431)

For this reason (literally *Therefore*): The initial Hebrew word of [2:6](https://ref.ly/Hos2:6) (also of [2:9](https://ref.ly/Hos2:9) and [2:14](https://ref.ly/Hos2:14)) introduces God’s judgment on Israel. Because of her idolatry, the Lord would restrict Israel’s access to the Canaanite fertility gods. Like an aggressive prostitute, she will pursue her lovers; but she will not find them. In the end, Israel will conclude that it is better to return to her rightful husband.

## Hosea 2:8 (id: 13432)

She doesn’t realize (literally *she doesn’t know*): Israel needs to know God personally and experientially. Had the Israelites known the Lord in this way, they would have realized that every good thing in their lives came from him, not from the baals.

* **Associated Passages:** HOS 2:8
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Hosea 2:9–13 (id: 13433)

God’s first judgment ([2:6–7](https://ref.ly/Hos2:6-Hos2:7)) was to restrict the Israelites; this second judgment would be to remove and destroy what he alone had given them.

## Hosea 2:11 (id: 13418)

From the context ([2:13](https://ref.ly/Hos2:13), [16–17](https://ref.ly/Hos2:16-Hos2:17)), as well as from similar passages in [Isa 1:12–17](https://ref.ly/Isa1:12-Isa1:17) and [Amos 5:21–24](https://ref.ly/Amos5:21-Amos5:24), it seems clear that the Israelites had defiled the legitimate festivals, new moon celebrations, and Sabbath days by combining worship of the Lord with worship of the Canaanite fertility god, Baal. God rejects such *syncretism* (mixing of different faiths) and declared that he would remove these unholy days from Israel’s calendar.

* **Associated Passages:** HOS 2:11
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Hosea 2:13 (id: 13419)

While the Israelites were worshiping Canaanite gods, they forgot the Lord. For Hosea, *to forget* is not a lapse of memory, but the opposite of *knowing* the Lord (see [8:14](https://ref.ly/Hos8:14); [13:6](https://ref.ly/Hos13:6); [Job 8:12–13](https://ref.ly/Job8:12-Job8:13)). Had Israel truly known the Lord, they would never have indulged in Baal worship.

* **Associated Passages:** HOS 2:13
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Hosea 2:14–15 (id: 13420)

The third judgment (see note on [2:6–7](https://ref.ly/Hos2:6-Hos2:7)) is completely unexpected. The Lord, who had innocently suffered Israel’s repeated unfaithfulness, announces that he will take the initiative in wooing Israel in order to win her back once again. He will lead her into the desert where he first entered into covenant with her, away from the seductive influences of Canaanite religion. • The Valley of Trouble was the scene of Israel’s first act of disobedience after they entered the Promised Land ([Josh 7:24–26](https://ref.ly/Josh7:24-Josh7:26)). The Lord had both the will and the power to grant Israel a new beginning after their sin and trouble ([Josh 8:1–22](https://ref.ly/Josh8:1-Josh8:22)), so Israel would again be offered a gateway of hope.

* **Associated Passages:** HOS 2:14–HOS 2:15
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Hosea 2:16 (id: 13421)

that day: This seemingly unremarkable phrase is actually quite important in the prophets. It refers to the coming day of the Lord (see [Joel 1:15](https://ref.ly/Joel1:15); [2:1](https://ref.ly/Joel2:1); [Amos 5:18](https://ref.ly/Amos5:18)), when the Lord will act decisively in human history on behalf of his people. • ‘my husband’ instead of ‘my master’: In this coming day, Israel will enter into a new relationship with her God. No longer will Israel call God “master” (Hebrew ba‘al), which connotes subservience and was also the name of the chief Canaanite fertility god. Instead, she will address the Lord as “husband,” implying partnership and companionship ([Gen 2:23–24](https://ref.ly/Gen2:23-Gen2:24)).

## Hosea 2:19–20 (id: 13424)

I will make you my wife: This Hebrew verb, used three times in these verses, can be translated with our seldom\-used word *betroth*. In the ancient world, betrothal entailed all the legal steps of a marriage, including the payment of a bride price by the groom. The only thing missing was the marriage ceremony and sexual consummation. The Lord vowed to betroth Israel to himself forever. To ensure the eternal nature of this new marriage, God provided a bride price that included five priceless qualities: righteousness and justice, unfailing love and compassion*,* and faithfulness. As a result, the Lord said, Israel will finally know me (cp. [2:13](https://ref.ly/Hos2:13)).

* **Associated Passages:** HOS 2:19–HOS 2:20
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Hosea 2:21–22 (id: 13427)

Unfaithful Israel thought her food and clothing were gifts from her lovers, the baals ([2:5](https://ref.ly/Hos2:5)), but in that day they will know that the Lord alone is the source of all fertility and blessing. He will answer the sky*,* the clouds*,* and the earth*,* initiating the true cycle of fertility for the land. When the Lord is recognized as the only source of life, then the name Jezreel will regain its true meaning: God plants!

## Hosea 2:23 (id: 13428)

As God has promised ([2:1](https://ref.ly/Hos2:1)), on the coming day of the Lord he will reverse the names of Gomer’s children. He will show love to ‘Not loved.’ To ‘Not my people,’ he will say, ‘Now you are my people.’ The only fitting response from God’s people is “You are our God!”

Go and love your wife again, even though she: The Lord commanded Hosea to restore his marriage as testimony that the Lord had promised to restore wayward Israel. • love to worship them: Literally *love their raisin cakes.* The worship of Asherah, a Canaanite fertility goddess, often included offerings of raisin cakes.

* **Associated Passages:** HOS 3:1
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Hosea 3:2 (id: 13435)

So I bought her back: The biblical text does not indicate why the prophet needed to purchase his wife. Most interpreters have assumed that the unfaithful Gomer had fallen into debt and become a slave. The meager price Hosea paid for her may indicate that Gomer was considered a slave of little value (see [Exod 21:32](https://ref.ly/Exod21:32); [Lev 27:4](https://ref.ly/Lev27:4)).

The Lord has brought charges against you: Hosea issued a divine indictment against Israel for breaking their covenant with the Lord (see also [Isa 3:13](https://ref.ly/Isa3:13); [Mic 6:2](https://ref.ly/Mic6:2)). The charges first focus on sins of omission, the qualities that should characterize the people of Israel but were absent. In Israel there is no faithfulness, no kindness, no knowledge of God. These theologically rich words describe the inward trust and devotion from which godly lives should spring.

* **Associated Passages:** HOS 4:1

## Hosea 4:1–14.9 (id: 13438)

This diverse collection of Hosea’s prophecies is presented in roughly chronological order, from early in his ministry during the reign of Jeroboam II until just before the destruction of Israel in 722 BC. Hosea presents God’s charges against Israel, tells them of the severe consequences for their sin, and concludes with a divine promise of future restoration.

The prophet also charged the Israelites for their sins of commission. The crimes listed here are all prohibited in the Ten Commandments ([Exod 20:3–17](https://ref.ly/Exod20:3-Exod20:17); [Deut 5:7–21](https://ref.ly/Deut5:7-Deut5:21)), the fundamental list of covenant responsibilities. Because the Israelites did not know the Lord, they did not practice even the most basic standards of covenant life.

When we are accused of a crime, our human inclination is to blame someone else, but God makes it clear that the blame for Israel’s apostasy lay with her religious leaders, priests*,* and false prophets. • God’s judgment on the priests and prophets was that they would stumble and fall (the same word in Hebrew), both professionally and personally.

* **Associated Passages:** HOS 4:4–HOS 4:5

## Hosea 4:6 (id: 13448)

Because the priests refused to know the Lord, neither did the people know their God. As a result, the people were being destroyed. • A primary function of the priests of Israel was to know, practice, and teach the laws of … God. Ironically, these guardians of the law had forgotten it.

God’s judgment matches the punishment to the crime. The Israelites worshiped Canaanite fertility deities with the expectation of bountiful crops and herds, but God’s judgment was that they would still be hungry and their religious prostitution would gain them nothing.

They ask a piece of wood for advice! For millennia, people have worshiped natural objects such as wood and stones that they believed embodied spirits and gods ([Jer 2:27](https://ref.ly/Jer2:27)). Biblical religion completely rejects such practices and beliefs ([Exod 20:4–5](https://ref.ly/Exod20:4-Exod20:5); [Isa 44:19](https://ref.ly/Isa44:19)).

## Hosea 5:3 (id: 13456)

you are utterly defiled: The word translated *defiled* is used frequently in the Pentateuch to describe ritual uncleanness, a physical condition that disqualified a person from worshiping God in the Temple ([Lev 11–15](https://ref.ly/Lev11:1-Lev15:33)). The prophets used the concept as a metaphor for Israel’s moral uncleanness as the result of her idolatry ([Isa 6:5](https://ref.ly/Isa6:5); [Mic 2:10](https://ref.ly/Mic2:10)).

Israel’s idolatrous practices were so ingrained that they were apparently powerless to return to the Lord. • You are a prostitute through and through (literally *the spirit of prostitution is within them*): Israel’s sin was not simply a behavior; it was the nation’s essential nature.

To move a boundary marker and change God’s allotted boundaries was to steal from God ([Deut 19:14](https://ref.ly/Deut19:14)).

In a final effort to avoid complete destruction, the Israelites overthrew King Pekah and placed a new king, Hoshea, on the throne.

## Hosea 6:6 (id: 13463)

In one of Hosea’s key verses, God names the most important qualities that should characterize the Israelites’ covenant lives with him. First, the Lord wants his people to show love more than he wants sacrifices. Love (Hebrew khesed) includes faithfulness (see [4:1](https://ref.ly/Hos4:1); [6:4](https://ref.ly/Hos6:4)). God is always faithful ([Ps 136](https://ref.ly/Ps136:1-Ps136:26)), and he requires the same of his people. Second, the Lord wants Israel to know him more than he wants burnt offerings. Knowing God is much more than simply knowing facts about God (see “Knowing God” Theme Note). An intimate personal relationship with God is characterized by complete trust and integrity. Sacrifice still had a proper place in Israelite religion, but only when it was offered by a people who truly knew and loved God (see [Isa 1:10–17](https://ref.ly/Isa1:10-Isa1:17); [Amos 5:21–24](https://ref.ly/Amos5:21-Amos5:24); [Mic 6:6–8](https://ref.ly/Mic6:6-Mic6:8)).

where is your king? When Hoshea’s alliance with Egypt failed (see [12:1](https://ref.ly/Hos12:1)), he tried to make peace with Assyria, but he was captured and imprisoned ([2 Kgs 17:4](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:4)). The Israelites had relied on their armies and kings to save them rather than on the Lord, and now there was no one to save them.

Israel was like a child in the womb who resists being born (literally *an unwise son*). Incredibly, Israel would rather stay in the womb than receive life from the Lord.

The term here translated the grave (Hebrew *Sheol*) refers to the realm of the dead (see [Job 3:11–19](https://ref.ly/Job3:11-Job3:19); see also study note on Job 7:9). The Lord is sovereign even over Sheol, and he could redeem Israel if he chose to. But he will not take pity on the Israelites, and he calls upon death to punish them.

In 722 BC, Assyria captured Samaria, the capital of the northern kingdom ([2 Kgs 17:5–6](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:5-2Kgs17:6)).

## Hosea 14:2–3 (id: 13410)

Hosea composed a model prayer of confession to help his people return to the Lord. God’s prophets not only identified with God in his outrage over Israel’s rebellion; they also identified with the people in their broken condition (see also [Dan 9:4–19](https://ref.ly/Dan9:4-Dan9:19)). • Forgive all our sins: The Israelites should throw themselves upon God’s mercy and grace, freely acknowledging their many sins. • so that we may offer you our praises: Israel’s inclination was to offer animal sacrifices for sin, but the Lord had made it clear that sacrifices were not the solution (see [Hos 6:6](https://ref.ly/Hos6:6)). Israel should offer God genuine repentance.

The Israelites must renounce their dependence upon idols, foreign alliances, and their own military strength.
