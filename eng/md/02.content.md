## Exodus 1:1 (id: 10991)

Israel is the name God had given to Jacob*,* son of Isaac and grandson of Abraham ([Gen 32:28](https://ref.ly/Gen32:28)). • Many years earlier, Jacob and his family had moved to Egypt, seeking refuge from severe drought (see [Gen 46:1–7](https://ref.ly/Gen46:1-Gen46:7)). Thanks to Joseph’s wisdom and leadership (see [Gen 41:25–49](https://ref.ly/Gen41:25-Gen41:49)), a steady grain supply had been stored (see [Gen 42:1–2](https://ref.ly/Gen42:1-Gen42:2); [45:5–7](https://ref.ly/Gen45:5-Gen45:7)).

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 1:1

## Exodus 1:1–22 (id: 10982)

The need for deliverance was obviously related to the Israelites’ condition (the Egyptians worked the people of Israel without mercy*,* [1:13](https://ref.ly/Exod1:13)); it also was related to promises God had made to the patriarchs years earlier. The Lord had promised Abraham that his descendants would be a great nation, living in freedom in the land of Canaan. At this point, Abraham’s descendants were slaves in Egypt under a pharaoh determined to decimate them as a people. God would have to rescue the people if his promises were to be kept.

## Exodus 1:2–4 (id: 10992)

For the births of Jacob’s sons, see [Gen 29:31–30:24](https://ref.ly/Gen29:31-Gen30:24); [35:16–18](https://ref.ly/Gen35:16-Gen35:18).

## Exodus 1:5 (id: 10994)

seventy descendants: The number 75 in the Greek version and the Dead Sea Scrolls might include the five sons of Ephraim and Manasseh ([Num 26:29](https://ref.ly/Num26:29), [35](https://ref.ly/Num26:35)). • Jacob’s eleventh son, Joseph*,* had been sold into Egyptian slavery by his jealous brothers ([Gen 37:18–28](https://ref.ly/Gen37:18-Gen37:28)). God accomplished good for his people in spite of the brothers’ sin. With Joseph present in Egypt, God could use him to save the lives of the chosen people from the famine that would have destroyed them ([Gen 42:1–2](https://ref.ly/Gen42:1-Gen42:2); [50:19–20](https://ref.ly/Gen50:19-Gen50:20)).

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 1:5

## Exodus 1:6–7 (id: 10995)

The long sojourn of Jacob’s family in Egypt was part of a divine design. God had told Abraham that his descendants could not receive the land of Canaan for 400 years—until the sin of the Canaanites had come to its full fruition ([Gen 15:13–16](https://ref.ly/Gen15:13-Gen15:16)). Even in Egypt, God’s promises were at work, and the descendants of aged Abraham and barren Sarah multiplied . . . greatly as God had said ([Gen 15:5](https://ref.ly/Gen15:5)), because God blessed them ([Ps 105:24](https://ref.ly/Ps105:24)).

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 1:6–EXO 1:7

## Exodus 1:8–10 (id: 10996)

From about 1650 to 1550 BC, Semitic invaders ruled northern Egypt, where the Israelites lived. The Egyptians called these rulers "shepherd kings" or *Hyksos*. Semitic peoples were ancient groups from the Middle East and North Africa, known for their shared languages (such as Hebrew, Aramaic, or Arabic) and cultural traditions.

Many scholars think these kings supported the Israelites, who might have allied with them. Egypt finally expelled the invaders around 1540 BC. The new rulers of Egypt's 18th Dynasty probably did not trust any remaining Semites, including the Israelites.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 1:8–EXO 1:10

## Exodus 1:10 (id: 10983)

The people Pharaoh called *our enemies* were probably the remaining Hyksos (see study note on 1:8–10).

## Exodus 1:11 (id: 10984)

Archaeologists have identified *Pithom and Rameses* with the modern cities of Tell el\-Maskhutah and Qantir. Ancient remains show people built these cities during the Late Bronze period (1550–1250 BC), when the Israelites were also present.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 1:11

## Exodus 1:12 (id: 10985)

In spite of the concerted Egyptian oppression, the Israelites multiplied and spread*;* God was keeping his promise about giving Abraham many descendants ([Gen 15:5](https://ref.ly/Gen15:5)).

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 1:12

## Exodus 1:14 (id: 10986)

The only stone that the Egyptians could obtain for building purposes came from the far south of the country. Therefore, in the north where the Hebrews were settled, only the most important state and religious buildings were made of stone. The rest were constructed with mortar and bricks made of durable clay with a binder such as seashells or straw mixed in. After being sun\-dried in a form, these materials were surprisingly durable—especially in a land such as Egypt, where there was little rainfall or humidity.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 1:14

## Exodus 1:15 (id: 10987)

Pharaoh is a title for the Egyptian ruler, not a personal name. • The origins of the word Hebrew are unclear. As used by the Egyptians and Philistines in reference to the Israelites, it was apparently a derogatory term for a despised underclass. • Whatever the number of Hebrew people (see study note on 12:37), there were clearly more than two midwives for the whole nation. Probably the two named here, Shiphrah and Puah*,* are representatives of the whole group. The differences between Pharaoh and the midwives are dramatic. He had great political and military power; they had none. He had great official prestige; they had very little. He was a man; they were women. He was of the ruling people; they were slaves. He was rich; they were poor. They could easily have been cowed into obedience, but they were not.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 1:15
* **Associated Articles:** Exodus 12:37 (ID: `11027@TyndaleStudyNotes`)

## Exodus 1:16 (id: 10988)

watch as they deliver (literally *look upon the two stones*): The Hebrew might refer to a birthstool or genitalia. • If the baby is a boy, kill him; if it is a girl, let her live: Such selective genocide would not completely deprive the Egyptians of a free labor source. When grown, the girls would be married to slaves from other people groups, effectively destroying Hebrew cohesion while keeping the supply of slaves as high as possible.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 1:16

## Exodus 1:17 (id: 10989)

The midwives . . . refused to obey the mighty Egyptian king because they feared God more than they feared Pharaoh ([1:21](https://ref.ly/Exod1:21)). Fear of the Lord (reverent awe of him as the almighty Creator and Judge) is the foundation of true knowledge and of wisdom ([Prov 1:7](https://ref.ly/Prov1:7); [9:10](https://ref.ly/Prov9:10)). The Lord is a friend to those who fear him ([Ps 25:14](https://ref.ly/Ps25:14)). The midwives understood that the Lord has more power than any human being.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 1:17

## Exodus 1:19 (id: 10990)

It might trouble us that the midwives were not candid in giving their main reason for keeping the boy babies alive. Comprehensive honesty is less important to God than absolute faithfulness to him and to his believing community.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 1:19

## Exodus 1:20–21 (id: 10993)

he gave them families: For most of history, children have had the worthy goal of growing up to raise a family. God graciously granted the universal wish of these women who served him courageously and faithfully.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 1:20–EXO 1:21

## Exodus 2:1 (id: 11130)

The man and woman were named Amram and Jochebed ([6:20](https://ref.ly/Exod6:20)). • Levi was Jacob’s third son by his wife Leah ([Gen 29:34](https://ref.ly/Gen29:34)).

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 2:1

## Exodus 2:1–25 (id: 11119)

[Chapter 1](https://ref.ly/Exod1:1-Exod1:22) established the need for rescue; ch [2](https://ref.ly/Exod2:1-Exod2:25) describes the preparation of Moses, the rescuer. God used the destruction of the Hebrew boy babies to ensure that the rescuer would be trained (see study note on 2:10) for his task.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 2:1–EXO 2:25
* **Associated Articles:** Exodus 2:10 (ID: `11120@TyndaleStudyNotes`)

## Exodus 2:2 (id: 11132)

a special baby (literally *he was good*): This is probably a reference to his appearance: He was a “perfect” baby.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 2:2

## Exodus 2:3 (id: 11133)

Papyrus reeds grew plentifully along the many streams into which the Nile River divided in the delta region of northern Egypt. They were light and flexible, well\-suited for basket weaving. It is possible that Moses’ mother placed the basket in the water exactly where it was most likely to be found by the Egyptian princess.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 2:3

## Exodus 2:5–6 (id: 11134)

Much like the Ganges River in modern India, the Nile was understood by the Egyptians to be a goddess who had life\-giving and healing properties. When Pharaoh’s daughter came down to bathe in the river*,* she was not merely washing but completing her morning devotions. The discovery of the baby floating on the river, in the embrace of the Nile goddess (as she saw it), would be very significant to her. It is also natural for a young woman to feel sorry for a crying baby. The combination of factors may account for her rescuing the child, though she recognized that he was Hebrew (Hebrews and Egyptians practiced circumcision differently).

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 2:5–EXO 2:6

## Exodus 2:7–9 (id: 11135)

It is evidence of God’s grace and sovereignty that Pharaoh’s daughter ironically paid Moses’ mother to nurse her own baby rather than having him killed according to Pharaoh’s command. The narrator seems to imply that the princess realized who the baby’s mother was (since she didn’t ask any embarrassing questions). If so, the two women chose to understand each other while maintaining a legal fiction. Moses was saved because God was at work, not because anyone was fooled.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 2:7–EXO 2:9

## Exodus 2:10 (id: 11120)

God not only saved Moses’ life for his future calling, he also arranged for him to receive administrative, military, and leadership training from the oppressors of his people. A pharaoh was expected to sire as many children as was physically possible to prove his power. Male offspring were placed in civil and military positions. It is very likely that the adopted son of a princess would have had such experiences (see [Acts 7:22](https://ref.ly/Acts7:22)). • Moses: The princess gave the child an Egyptian name that is found in the full names of many prominent Egyptians, including the 18th Dynasty pharaohs named *Ahmose* (1550–1525 BC) and *Thutmose* (1504–1390 BC). By naming the child Moses (meaning “to give birth”), the princess was perhaps saying that the Nile, revered as a source of life, had given birth to the baby. The Israelites drew a connection between the name *Moses* and the similar sounding Hebrew term mashah*,* which means “to lift out.”

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 2:10

## Exodus 2:11–12 (id: 11121)

Moses had a privileged upbringing as compared with the toil and hardship of his own people, the Hebrews, but he was willing to identify with them and help them to the point of jeopardizing his own privileges.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 2:11–EXO 2:12

## Exodus 2:11–15 (id: 11122)

This section addresses Moses’ first abortive attempt to rescue Israel in his own strength. This incident shows Moses’ courage and decisiveness, but it also shows his tendency to assume the responsibility himself, which would later have tragic effects in his life ([Num 20:1–13](https://ref.ly/Num20:1-Num20:13)). Moses’ concern for his people’s welfare was good; his timing and manner did not accord with God’s plan.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 2:11–EXO 2:15

## Exodus 2:13 (id: 11123)

Moses, who had put himself at risk to prevent an Egyptian from beating a Hebrew, must have been especially angered to see a Hebrew beating up a fellow Hebrew.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 2:13

## Exodus 2:14 (id: 11124)

The arrogant response of the Hebrew man, “Who appointed you to be our prince and judge?” foreshadows how the rest of the Hebrews would respond to Moses in later years—they would not thank him for his efforts on their behalf. If Moses were to succeed, he would have to depend solely on a sense of his divine calling.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 2:14

## Exodus 2:15 (id: 11125)

Moses fled: By trying to rescue Israel himself rather than through God’s help, Moses made himself a fugitive rather than a leader in Egypt, forestalling God’s purposes for him. Moses’ life was drastically changed as a consequence of his actions (cp. [Num 20:9–13](https://ref.ly/Num20:9-Num20:13); [Deut 3:23–29](https://ref.ly/Deut3:23-Deut3:29)). • Midian was located on both sides of the Gulf of Aqaba—in the southern Sinai Peninsula and on the western edge of the Arabian Peninsula. A major trade route from southern Arabia passed through this dry and barren area. Its people seem to have been nomadic shepherds and traders (see [Gen 37:28](https://ref.ly/Gen37:28)). It was a good place for a fugitive to disappear.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 2:15

## Exodus 2:16 (id: 11127)

The priest of Midian was named Reuel ([2:18](https://ref.ly/Exod2:18)), but later he is called Jethro ([18:1](https://ref.ly/Exod18:1)). It was common for a person to have both an official name and a personal name, though in this case it is not clear which is which. Perhaps, like Melchizedek ([Gen 14:18](https://ref.ly/Gen14:18)), he represented an indigenous religious class that had not fallen prey to a pagan religion. Reuel’s actions in bringing an offering and sacrifices to God ([Exod 18:12](https://ref.ly/Exod18:12)) suggest that this was so.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 2:16

## Exodus 2:16–25 (id: 11126)

This passage further reveals Moses’ concern for the oppressed and tells of his transition to a new land ([2:18–22](https://ref.ly/Exod2:18-Exod2:22)). He married, had a child, and lived there for forty years ([Acts 7:30](https://ref.ly/Acts7:30)). From a human perspective, there was no way for the Israelites to be rescued through Moses, but it is the divine perspective that matters. The end of this section ([Exod 2:23–25](https://ref.ly/Exod2:23-Exod2:25)) tells us that God had not forgotten his people; he was only waiting for the time to act ([2:25](https://ref.ly/Exod2:25)).

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 2:16–EXO 2:25

## Exodus 2:17 (id: 11128)

rescued: Now a stranger in a strange land, Moses still could not stand by and allow oppression to continue—he was, by nature, a rescuer. The NLT has captured the correct sense of the Hebrew word, sometimes translated *deliver* or *save.*

## Exodus 2:18–20 (id: 11129)

The father of seven daughters was not about to leave a generous and courageous male—excellent husband material—unaccounted for! We see here the well\-known hospitality (see also [Gen 18:1–8](https://ref.ly/Gen18:1-Gen18:8)) that characterizes the residents of this region to this day.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 2:18–EXO 2:20

## Exodus 2:24–25 (id: 11131)

The verbs here speak of a God who is sensitive to his people’s needs (heard . . . looked down), who is faithful and reliable (remembered his covenant promise), and who accepts his obligations in a relationship (knew it was time to act).

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 2:24–EXO 2:25

## Exodus 3:1 (id: 11281)

Sinai is the name usually used for the mountain where God later revealed himself in the covenant (see, e.g., [16:1](https://ref.ly/Exod16:1); [19:1–2](https://ref.ly/Exod19:1-Exod19:2)). Here and in [17:6](https://ref.ly/Exod17:6) and [33:6](https://ref.ly/Exod33:6) the Hebrew text uses the proper name *Horeb.* Both names presumably refer to the same mountain, so the NLT consistently uses Sinai.

In these verses, the stage is set for the reorientation of Moses’ life.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 3:1–EXO 3:10

## Exodus 3:1–4.28 (id: 11270)

This section presents Moses’ call to rescue the Israelites from Egyptian bondage. It is divided into two subsections, [3:1–4:17](https://ref.ly/Exod3:1-Exod4:17) and [4:18–28](https://ref.ly/Exod4:18-Exod4:28). The first deals with the call itself, while the second addresses the full implications of accepting that call. Moses was not presented with a mere vocational change; he faced an entire reorientation of his life.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 3:1–EXO 4:28

## Exodus 3:2 (id: 11283)

Technically, the angel of the Lord is the Lord’s officially authorized envoy, but the expression may be used more broadly of other visible manifestations of the Lord (see [Gen 16:9–13](https://ref.ly/Gen16:9-Gen16:13); [Judg 13:3](https://ref.ly/Judg13:3), [6](https://ref.ly/Judg13:6), [21–22](https://ref.ly/Judg13:21-Judg13:22)). • In the Bible, blazing fire often represents God’s transcendent holiness (see [Exod 19:18](https://ref.ly/Exod19:18); [Gen 15:17](https://ref.ly/Gen15:17); [1 Kgs 18:38–39](https://ref.ly/1Kgs18:38-1Kgs18:39); [Isa 33:14](https://ref.ly/Isa33:14)). • didn’t burn up: This may show that God does not wish to consume the vehicle that he sets ablaze for his purposes.

Moses! Moses! God knows his people by name, and individuals are important to him.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 3:4

## Exodus 3:5 (id: 11285)

The soil around the bush was holy ground, while the soil on the bottom of Moses’ sandals was common. The common cannot touch the holy without being transformed or destroyed (see “Clean, Unclean, and Holy” Theme Note). At the outset of the Exodus, God was making it plain that he is absolutely “other” than his creation, a reality that cannot be overlooked in a proper divine\-human relationship. The word holy occurs only a few times in the Bible prior to [Exod 3:5](https://ref.ly/Exod3:5). It now becomes the central descriptor of God in the Old Testament. In other Semitic languages, the same root occurs infrequently. It does not describe a moral quality in these other languages but simply what is “other than” human. The pagan gods, for instance, were “holy” only in the sense of being “other”—they did everything humans do, good and evil, but on a larger scale. In the Bible, by contrast, moral perfection is a central idea of the term *holy.* The one true God is the only being in the universe who truly stands apart from this world and is worthy of being called “holy” in this general sense. The true God is perfectly consistent and moral in his character. Here, at the burning bush, God revealed his otherness. Later at Sinai, he revealed his moral character in his requirements for those who would be his covenant partners (see [Exod 19:6](https://ref.ly/Exod19:6); [20:1–23:33](https://ref.ly/Exod20:1-Exod23:33); see also [Lev 11:45](https://ref.ly/Lev11:45); [1 Pet 1:13–16](https://ref.ly/1Pet1:13-1Pet1:16)).

## Exodus 3:6 (id: 11286)

This transcendent God had committed himself to Moses’ ancestors in a faithful promise maintained for hundreds of years. Moses was in awe of the one, holy, and transcendent God of Abraham. Jesus quoted this verse when he was sparring with the Sadducees about the concept of resurrection ([Matt 22:32](https://ref.ly/Matt22:32); [Mark 12:26](https://ref.ly/Mark12:26); [Luke 20:37](https://ref.ly/Luke20:37)).

## Exodus 3:8 (id: 11288)

God would not only rescue them but would take them to their own . . . land that he had promised to Abraham ([Gen 13:14–18](https://ref.ly/Gen13:14-Gen13:18)). • flowing with milk and honey: The land was agriculturally rich, with pasturage for cattle and crops with blooms from which bees could make honey. • Canaanites . . . Jebusites: The list of peoples who lived in Canaan indicates the importance of this strip of land between the Mediterranean Sea and the Arabian Desert. As a vital crossroads for trade and communication between Egypt and the rest of the ancient Near East, it was a hotly contested prize. That Israel could end up in sole possession of it seemed an impossibility.

## Exodus 3:10 (id: 11271)

God would act compassionately to save his suffering people, but it would be through a human agency. Often God is known among us because of the way his people carry out his will.

## Exodus 3:11–12 (id: 11272)

Moses first protested that he was unworthy of such a great task, but God responded that this was not the issue. Human worthiness is of no significance if God’s presence is with that person.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 3:11–EXO 3:12

## Exodus 3:11–4.17 (id: 11273)

Moses, in his response to God, presented four reasons why he was not the one to fulfill God’s call. Although each reason supposedly relates to Moses and his ability, God’s answers show that they were really questions about God.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 3:11–EXO 4:17

## Exodus 3:12 (id: 11274)

In the Bible, a sign often occurred after a person or a nation had already had to decide whether to act in faith or not (see [Isa 7:14](https://ref.ly/Isa7:14)). A sign cannot create faith where there is none (see [Matt 12:39](https://ref.ly/Matt12:39); [16:4](https://ref.ly/Matt16:4)). Rather, it encourages the one who has exercised the faith he or she already has.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 3:12

## Exodus 3:13–22 (id: 11275)

Moses’ second protest was that he had inadequate knowledge. He did not know God’s name. This might mean that God’s personal name had not yet been revealed (see study notes on 6:2–3). It is also possible that Moses meant he did not know the secret, magic formula that a man of power might have been expected to make use of. Interest in such things was common in the ancient Near East. God’s direct response is almost a riddle, but the majority of his answer is a statement of his faithfulness in the past and a demonstration of his knowledge of the future. There is nothing magical about the name *Yahweh.* Knowledge of secret formulas and magic powers is not the issue; the issue is the character of God and his lordship of history. The reason there is “something about that name” is because of the incomparable character and nature of the one who bears it.

## Exodus 3:14 (id: 11276)

I Am Who I Am: This name speaks of a God who is self\-sufficient, self\-existent, all encompassing, and without limitations, the one being in the universe who is not dependent on something else for his existence.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 3:14

## Exodus 3:15 (id: 11277)

Yahweh is probably a form of the Hebrew verb “to be,” so it could mean “he causes to be,” or “he who is,” or “I am.” Later Jews were not permitted to speak God’s name aloud, so the Hebrew text supplies the vowels from the word ’adonay (which means “lord” or “master”) whenever God’s proper name, YHWH, appears. In oral reading, the Hebrew reader would pronounce *’adonay,* even though the written text is *YHWH.* We do not know the pronunciation of the divine name. The widely used *Yahweh* is an informed guess. The English word “Jehovah” is an artificial term made by combining the vowels of ’adonay with the consonants Y\-H\-W\-H. In the NLT, this name is usually translated “Lord” (with small capitals), but it is transliterated “Yahweh” in the few instances, like this verse, where a point is made about the name itself. Also in [6:2–3](https://ref.ly/Exod6:2-Exod6:3); [15:3](https://ref.ly/Exod15:3); [33:19](https://ref.ly/Exod33:19); [34:5–6](https://ref.ly/Exod34:5-Exod34:6).

Moses was to tell the people of Israel that the God who now spoke to them was the same God their ancestors knew and worshiped, and that he would lead them into a fruitful land wrested from the hands of many others. Moses’ message was not a magical formula, but the word of a God who, standing outside of history, can yet enter and direct it. • flowing with milk and honey: See study note on 3:8.

Moses’ third protest was that he lacked power. God answered in a very convincing demonstration of divine power by instantaneous creation of a snake and of a severe skin disease.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 4:1–EXO 4:9

## Exodus 4:3 (id: 11384)

Across the ancient Near East, the snake was a symbol of both death and healing. The person who demonstrated power in these areas was powerful indeed.

## Exodus 4:6 (id: 11385)

severe skin disease: The Hebrew word underlying this phrase has traditionally been translated “leprosy.” However, the symptoms of this condition as described in the Bible are not those of the disease we know as leprosy (Hansen’s disease). The biblical term seems to describe several kinds of highly contagious inflammations and skin lesions.

## Exodus 4:9 (id: 11386)

As with the previous two signs, the fact that the water from the Nile will turn to blood also demonstrated God’s power over life and death.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 4:9

## Exodus 4:10–17 (id: 11372)

Moses’ fourth and final protest was that he could not speak effectively. Moses was apparently grasping at straws in trying to escape this dangerous and unpleasant assignment, and God was becoming angry at Moses’ refusal to grasp the truth. The outcome did not depend on Moses’ ability, but upon his willingness to let God’s power operate through him.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 4:10–EXO 4:17

## Exodus 4:11 (id: 11373)

God created the organs of speech and has ordained every person’s particular abilities in this area. He is able to use what he has made and ordained.

Having run out of protests, Moses simply asked to be excused.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 4:13

## Exodus 4:14–17 (id: 11375)

God would not let Moses evade responsibility, but he would accommodate Moses’ concern by allowing Moses’ brother Aaron to become Moses’ mouthpiece ([14:16](https://ref.ly/Exod14:16)). As the narrative unfolds, the text records fewer and fewer occasions of Aaron serving in this capacity. Moses’ speaking problem was perhaps not as serious as he made it out to be, or the problem began to dissipate as his experience increased.

These verses summarize the events of the next several chapters, beginning with the request to let the people go so that they could worship God ([5:3](https://ref.ly/Exod5:3)) and concluding with the final plague, the death of the firstborn ([11:4–6](https://ref.ly/Exod11:4-Exod11:6)). God was preparing the rescuer for the difficult task ahead (see [11:9](https://ref.ly/Exod11:9)).

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 4:21–EXO 4:23

## Exodus 4:24–26 (id: 11379)

This incident is shrouded in mystery. That Zipporah responded immediately and circumcised her son suggests that she and Moses had discussed the possibility of doing so previously and had decided it was not necessary. Why would having an uncircumcised son lead to God’s intent to kill the rescuer he had carefully prepared and called? Perhaps if Moses had arrived in Egypt claiming to represent the God of the Israelites’ ancestors and yet had not done the one thing God had commanded of his followers to this point ([Gen 17:10](https://ref.ly/Gen17:10)), then the people would have been less inclined to follow God in a radically exclusive way.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 4:24–EXO 4:26

Pharaoh made the work harder in retaliation for their insubordination; he also believed they had too much time on their hands ([5:8](https://ref.ly/Exod5:8)). He could not conceive of a god who would reveal himself outside of the established royal system of worship, so the only explanation he could imagine for their strange religious ideas was that they had dreamed them up themselves—when they should have been working (see also [5:17](https://ref.ly/Exod5:17)).

## Exodus 5:22 (id: 11396)

The phrase brought all this trouble could be translated even more strongly as *done all this evil.* Is God really good or not? Instead of rescuing the people out of their evil circumstances as he had promised, it seems that God had only made the situation worse. Is he faithful or not? Is he powerful or not? (cp. [Ps 105:25–27](https://ref.ly/Ps105:25-Ps105:27)).

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 5:22

## Exodus 5:22–23 (id: 11395)

This was the crisis point. After the initial burst of enthusiasm ([4:29–31](https://ref.ly/Exod4:29-Exod4:31)), the offer of rescue produced nothing but skepticism, hostility, and worse oppression than before. Moses, the rescuer, was himself reduced to doubt.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 5:22–EXO 5:23

## Exodus 6:1 (id: 11408)

Now you will see: Far from being daunted by the questions being raised about his integrity, his ability, and his very character, God looked forward to the clash of worldviews that lay ahead. Pharaoh*,* thinking himself divine, would just be a pawn in the hand of the one true God.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 6:1

## Exodus 6:1–13 (id: 11402)

God renewed his promises. The offer of rescue brought the true question to the fore, the question articulated by Pharaoh: Who is the Lord ([5:2](https://ref.ly/Exod5:2))? As much as the Israelites needed rescue from bondage, their greater need was to know the Lord. The climax of God’s renewed promises was “you will know that I am the Lord your God” ([6:7](https://ref.ly/Exod6:7)).

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 6:1–EXO 6:13

## Exodus 6:2–3 (id: 11409)

I am Yahweh . . . El\-Shaddai: Here the NLT transliterates the divine names *Yahweh* and *El\-Shaddai* because God was emphasizing that he was now using a different name than the name by which he was known to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. To assist the English reader, the translators have also supplied the English terms usually used for these Hebrew terms: “the Lord” and “God Almighty.” • I did not reveal my name, Yahweh, to them: The name Yahweh in fact appears frequently in Genesis (translated “the Lord”). Two solutions are possible: (1\) The name Yahweh was not known to the patriarchs, but Moses, the author of Genesis, was inspired to insert that name in those places in Genesis where God’s grace and his nature as covenant\-keeper were apparent. While the patriarchs might have known the name Yahweh, it is possible that they had never seen God’s nature displayed as it was in the Exodus and the Sinai covenant. In Hebrew, a person’s name has a broader significance than it does in English. People’s names were intended to reflect their character and nature, not just serve as a label (see, e.g., [Pss 8:1](https://ref.ly/Ps8:1), [9](https://ref.ly/Ps8:9); [148:13](https://ref.ly/Ps148:13)). Here reveal is a Hebrew word often translated “to know,” which implies intimate knowledge and experience. In this case, the patriarchs knew God’s name, but they did not know and experience his nature fully as he revealed himself in the Exodus.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 6:2–EXO 6:3

## Exodus 6:2–8 (id: 11410)

Once again, God forcefully linked his promises to the patriarchs (Abraham’s family) with what he was about to do. God’s work in history shows his faithfulness. He has made promises, and he will keep them. God also wished to reveal more of himself than he had been able to do with the patriarchs. This generation would know more of God and his intentions than Abraham had, particularly regarding the implications of the covenant ([6:4–5](https://ref.ly/Exod6:4-Exod6:5)). Why does God redeem ([6:6](https://ref.ly/Exod6:6))? Why did he reveal himself to Abraham in the first place? God wanted the Israelites to be his own people, and he wanted to be their God ([6:7](https://ref.ly/Exod6:7)). God’s goal is for humanity to be in a lovingly submissive covenant relationship with him, where we can be what he made us to be.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 6:2–EXO 6:8

## Exodus 6:7 (id: 11412)

Then you will know that I am the Lord: The Hebrew word translated *know* is always based on experience and relationship. The same word is used to describe human sexual relations. To *know* God as Yahweh is not just to know abstract facts about him, but to be in a relationship with him in which we are always learning who he is and what he wants us to do. This is the only true rescue from the human predicament of sin described in [Gen 3–11](https://ref.ly/Gen3:1-Gen11:32). The importance of “knowing the Lord” in the book of Exodus is seen in its recurrence, especially in [Exod 5–18](https://ref.ly/Exod5:1-Exod18:27) ([5:2](https://ref.ly/Exod5:2); [7:5](https://ref.ly/Exod7:5), [17](https://ref.ly/Exod7:17); [8:10](https://ref.ly/Exod8:10), [22](https://ref.ly/Exod8:22); [9:29](https://ref.ly/Exod9:29); [10:2](https://ref.ly/Exod10:2); [11:7](https://ref.ly/Exod11:7); [14:4](https://ref.ly/Exod14:4), [18](https://ref.ly/Exod14:18); [16:6](https://ref.ly/Exod16:6), [12](https://ref.ly/Exod16:12); [18:11](https://ref.ly/Exod18:11)).

The crisis hit bottom. Even Moses was back to the situation on Sinai, where he had first responded to God’s call with protests of inadequacy ([3:1–4:13](https://ref.ly/Exod3:1-Exod4:13)). But God renewed his orders.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 6:14–EXO 6:16

## Exodus 6:14–30 (id: 11405)

This genealogical interlude places Moses and Aaron among the families of Israel. That it is an interlude is clear because [6:30](https://ref.ly/Exod6:30) is a repetition of[6:12](https://ref.ly/Exod6:12). There is a recurring emphasis in Exodus on Yahweh as the God of the ancestors, both explicitly (from [3:6](https://ref.ly/Exod3:6)on) and implicitly (from [1:1](https://ref.ly/Exod1:1) on). What was about to happen was not an unrelated action by some new god who was devaluing impotent older gods (a typical theme in ancient pagan literature). Unlike pagan gods, whose only purpose is personal power, and who are in constant conflict among themselves, the true God has a single, overarching purpose: He wants his creation to find its fulfillment in proper relation to him. Although he enacts that purpose in ever\-expanding displays of creativity, the new activities are always consistent with what he has already revealed of himself. Moses and Aaron did not suddenly appear out of the unknown, but were an integral part of that same people to whom God first revealed himself and through whom he was about to give an even grander revelation. The genealogies of Jesus have a similar purpose ([Matt 1:1–16](https://ref.ly/Matt1:1-Matt1:16); [Luke 3:23–38](https://ref.ly/Luke3:23-Luke3:38)).

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 6:14–EXO 6:30

## Exodus 6:16–20 (id: 11406)

This genealogy of Levi’s descendants focuses on Aaron and Moses*;* four generations are given in the genealogy from Levi to Aaron and Moses (cp. [Gen 15:16](https://ref.ly/Gen15:16)). Since the people of Israel had lived in Egypt for 430 years (see [Exod 12:40–41](https://ref.ly/Exod12:40-Exod12:41); [Gen 15:13](https://ref.ly/Gen15:13)), this genealogy skips numerous generations. In [Gen 46:11](https://ref.ly/Gen46:11), Gershon, Kohath, and Merari are listed as the actual sons of Levi who moved down to Egypt with their father and the rest of Jacob’s family. Amram*’*s wife, Jochebed, gave birth to his sons ([Exod 6:20](https://ref.ly/Exod6:20)). This is very concrete language, so there is no reason to believe that there were unnamed generations between Amram and Aaron and Moses. This suggests that the unnamed generations were between Kohath (son of Levi) and Amram (father of Aaron and Moses).

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 6:16–EXO 6:20

## Exodus 6:18 (id: 11407)

The descendants (literally *sons*) of Kohath included Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel*:* The Hebrew word for “sons” can also mean “descendants,” which accommodates the possibility of unnamed generations.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 6:18

## Exodus 6:20–25 (id: 11411)

The descendants of Kohath’s sons now become the focus of the genealogy. The families of Aaron son of Amram and Korah son of Izhar are given a more detailed listing ([6:23–24](https://ref.ly/Exod6:23-Exod6:24)), followed by one of Aaron’s sons, Eleazar ([6:25](https://ref.ly/Exod6:25)). The focus is clearly on Aaron’s line through Eleazar, who received the high priesthood. The fact that Aaron and Korah were cousins makes it easier to see why Aaron’s elevation to high priesthood was so galling to Korah (see [Num 16:1–3](https://ref.ly/Num16:1-Num16:3)); family rivalry is nothing new. The later rebellion might explain why Korah and his sons are given particular mention in this genealogy.

## Exodus 7:1–7 (id: 11414)

In this final scene in the offer of rescue, the Lord once again answered Moses’ fears of not being able to speak eloquently. He would allow Moses to speak through Aaron (see [4:16](https://ref.ly/Exod4:16)), but Pharaoh will refuse to listen regardless. God’s power, not Moses’ eloquence, was the important factor. Moses and Aaron then took the step of faith and did what God had commanded. The first crisis (see study note on 5:22–23) had passed.

This section divides the events of rescue into two parts: the plagues ([7:8–11:10](https://ref.ly/Exod7:8-Exod11:10)) and the Passover ([12:1–30](https://ref.ly/Exod12:1-Exod12:30)). God demonstrated that he is the Lord of life and death and nothing has any power against him (see [Isa 43:13](https://ref.ly/Isa43:13)). The God of the patriarchs is also the God of the universe.

Serpent (Hebrew tannin) is a different word than the word translated “snake” in [4:3](https://ref.ly/Exod4:3). Tannin often refers to a sea monster. Egypt is often portrayed as an ultimately impotent sea monster ([Isa 30:7](https://ref.ly/Isa30:7); [Ezek 29:3](https://ref.ly/Ezek29:3)). The image of a cobra’s head was on the pharaoh’s headdress.

these Egyptian magicians did the same thing (see also [7:22](https://ref.ly/Exod7:22); [8:7](https://ref.ly/Exod8:7)): While demonic power might have been involved, it is also possible that some sleight of hand was being practiced. When they could not reproduce the plague of gnats, they declared that it was “the finger of God” ([8:19](https://ref.ly/Exod8:19)), indicating that their own actions were not a manifestation of divine power.

The first plague was the plague on the Nile, when the whole river turned to blood ([7:20](https://ref.ly/Exod7:20)). The Egyptians correctly understood that without the Nile there would be no life in Egypt. They worshiped the Nile as the Mother of Egypt, but God showed that life is his to give or withhold.

## Exodus 8:1–15 (id: 11425)

The second plague was the plague of frogs ([8:2](https://ref.ly/Exod8:2)). The Egyptians gave special reverence to amphibians because of their ability to live in two different worlds; Egyptians were deeply concerned with survival in the next world, after death. God showed that frogs have no special hold on life. This plague is sometimes said to have been a natural result of whatever happened to make the Nile River uninhabitable. However, the extent of the plague was more than a natural result.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 8:1–EXO 8:15

## Exodus 8:7–8 (id: 11434)

The magicians were able to duplicate the plague in some sense, but Pharaoh did not ask them to rid the land of the frogs. Instead, he begged Moses to ask God to take them away. He already knew where the real power was.

The fourth plague was the plague of flies. The Egyptians worshiped insects such as flies that seemed to be able to turn death into life, as their young seemed to emerge from decaying matter. If the Egyptians thought that insects had the secret of life, God would let them have all the insects they wanted. Some say that this infestation was the natural result of all the dead frogs, but there were no flies in Goshen ([8:22](https://ref.ly/Exod8:22)), the northeastern delta area where the Hebrews lived. God’s miraculous power was clearly seen in his ability to infest one area while sparing another at will.

Pharaoh attempted to bargain with God. He wanted to obey partially while still retaining control. James says of such people, “Their loyalty is divided between God and the world” ([Jas 1:8](https://ref.ly/Jas1:8)), and such a person cannot receive anything from the Lord.

Moses pointed out the impossibility of what Pharaoh was asking on the grounds of the Egyptians’ own prejudice: They considered all Semites to be uncultured and uncouth (see [Gen 43:32](https://ref.ly/Gen43:32)). • The Hebrews were leaving Egypt in order to worship God (see, e.g., [Exod 5:1](https://ref.ly/Exod5:1); [7:16](https://ref.ly/Exod7:16); [8:1](https://ref.ly/Exod8:1), [20](https://ref.ly/Exod8:20)).

I will pray: Moses was learning the role of intercessor that would be so much a part of his life in future years (see, e.g., [32:11–13](https://ref.ly/Exod32:11-Exod32:13), [30–32](https://ref.ly/Exod32:30-Exod32:32); [Num 14:13–19](https://ref.ly/Num14:13-Num14:19)). It must have been increasingly tempting to let the Egyptians continue to experience the results of their king’s stubbornness, but Moses was willing to plead with God not to leave them in a permanent state of grief and distress.

The fifth plague was against the livestock. As with the withholding of flies from the area where the Hebrews lived ([8:22–23](https://ref.ly/Exod8:22-Exod8:23)), the distinction between the livestock of the Israelites and that of the Egyptians ([9:4](https://ref.ly/Exod9:4)) shows that a natural explanation of this event is insufficient, even if the previous plagues contributed. The Egyptians, like many in the ancient Near East, worshiped the ram, the goat, and the bull as representing power and fertility. These animals had no power before the Lord, in whom true power resides.

Your livestock refers specifically to field animals. Other animals would have boils inflicted upon them in the next plague. • The term all (also in [9:6](https://ref.ly/Exod9:6)) is not absolute; it does not mean that every single livestock animal was killed. There were still some left to protect from the hail of the seventh plague ([9:20](https://ref.ly/Exod9:20)).

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 9:3

Prediction again played an important role. These events were being directed by the One who is sovereign over all that happens.

## Exodus 9:8–12 (id: 11447)

The sixth plague brought festering boils on humans and animals. At this point the magicians, far from being able to duplicate the sign, were unable to spare themselves from it. Their defeat was complete.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 9:8–EXO 9:12

## Exodus 9:12 (id: 11437)

Plagues five and six apparently dissipated on their own, since there was no plea by Pharaoh to bring them to an end.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 9:12

## Exodus 9:13–33 (id: 11438)

The seventh plague was a hailstorm ([9:18](https://ref.ly/Exod9:18)). It rains in Egypt only a few days each year, and hail and thunderstorms are largely unknown, so this storm would have been terrifying. That may be why there is more theological reflection associated with it. The devastating effect of the plague was to destroy the flax and barley crops ([9:31](https://ref.ly/Exod9:31)).

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 9:13–EXO 9:33

## Exodus 9:14–17 (id: 11439)

God explained the purpose of the plagues to Pharaoh: They were revelatory, designed to demonstrate (especially to Pharaoh) that there is no one like me in all the earth ([9:14](https://ref.ly/Exod9:14); see also [Isa 46:9](https://ref.ly/Isa46:9); [Jer 10:6–7](https://ref.ly/Jer10:6-Jer10:7)). God had not destroyed Pharaoh and Egypt in a single blow, as he could have done. Rather he had spared them ([Exod 9:16](https://ref.ly/Exod9:16)), giving them an opportunity to submit to his power. But Pharaoh refused to humble himself and stop lording it over the Lord’s people ([9:17](https://ref.ly/Exod9:17)).

Pharaoh was driven to a logical conclusion. In the face of such clear evidence to the contrary, pride was not merely a failure, it was a sin.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 9:27

## Exodus 9:29 (id: 11444)

There is no one like the Lord in all the earth ([9:14](https://ref.ly/Exod9:14)), and all the earth belongs to the Lord. This was the inescapable message of the plagues, though the Egyptians had difficulty accepting it.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 9:29

## Exodus 10:1–20 (id: 10997)

The eighth plague was the plague of locusts ([10:4](https://ref.ly/Exod10:4)). Evidently enough time had elapsed between this plague and the previous one that the wheat and emmer wheat had sprouted (see [9:32](https://ref.ly/Exod9:32)). The Egyptian god Osiris was especially revered as the god who descended into the underworld and brought plant life back in the spring. This second, climactic attack on the plant life demonstrated that even Osiris was helpless before the Lord. There is no eternal life in sprouting plants.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 10:1–EXO 10:20

## Exodus 10:2 (id: 11005)

The plagues were sent so that Israel will know that I am the Lord (similarly, with respect to Egypt, see [9:14–16](https://ref.ly/Exod9:14-Exod9:16)).

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 10:2

## Exodus 10:4 (id: 11006)

These locusts were not the insects called locusts in North America, but a form of migratory grasshopper. Swarming out of desert regions, they could devastate large areas of land, devouring all the plant life before them.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 10:4

## Exodus 10:7–11 (id: 11007)

The officials*,* with no royal prestige on the line, were willing to learn the lessons of God’s sovereignty and let the men go. Pharaoh again resisted, in an effort to save face somehow. He would let them go only if they left their families behind and were thus bound to return, but Moses had never said they would return. While the purpose for going into the wilderness was to worship God, it was unthinkable that oppressed slaves would willingly return to their oppressors once they were free, and Pharaoh knew it.

## Exodus 10:13–15 (id: 10998)

The miraculous nature of the locust plague was indicated by its timing (when Moses raised his staff) and by its extent and intensity (from one end of the country to the other*,* and there has never been another one like it).

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 10:13–EXO 10:15

## Exodus 10:17 (id: 11000)

Forgive my sin: Pharaoh’s recognition grew deeper; he admitted that his pride and refusal to keep his word were sins, and he recognized that sin cannot be ignored but must be forgiven. Unfortunately, his correct theological understanding did not in itself change his heart.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 10:17

## Exodus 10:21–29 (id: 11001)

The ninth plague was the plague of darkness ([10:21](https://ref.ly/Exod10:21)). The chief god of Egypt through the centuries, who appeared under several different names, was the sun. At this time he was known as Amon\-Re. He was supreme over all the other gods and was considered to be the ultimate source of life. The Lord showed that the sun’s light is completely under his control; he could shut it off from Egypt proper, while leaving it to shine in Goshen in the northeast part of the country ([10:23](https://ref.ly/Exod10:23); see study note on 9:1–7).

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 10:24

## Exodus 10:25–26 (id: 11003)

Moses was unrelenting. He knew that the Israelites, far from leaving any of their possessions behind, would be receiving gifts from the Egyptians, who would hurry them away ([3:21–22](https://ref.ly/Exod3:21-Exod3:22)). He also kept the focus on the worship of God. This continual refrain about the purpose for leaving Egypt (see study note on 8:26–27) reflects the key purpose of their exodus, to become the people of God.

## Exodus 10:27–29 (id: 11004)

Pharaoh seemed to realize that he had reached a point of no return. If he would not submit—the only action appropriate to what he had learned from the plagues—then he must kill the messenger. This reasoning is similar to that of the religious leaders later during the life of Christ. They refused to draw the appropriate conclusions from Jesus’ life and ministry, so they decided to kill him (see [John 11:45–53](https://ref.ly/John11:45-John11:53)).

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 10:27–EXO 10:29

## Exodus 11:1–9 (id: 11008)

The final plague was the death of the firstborn sons. The Egyptians worshiped life. They gave so much attention to preparations for life after death because they wanted to ensure that it would be at least as good as their lives in Egypt. Death itself is in God’s hand. There is no underworld god who can ultimately defeat the God of life. Both life and death belong to the Lord.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 11:1–EXO 11:9

## Exodus 11:3 (id: 11009)

Pharaoh refused to recognize the truth, but the Lord ensured that the rest of Egypt would recognize it.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 11:3

## Exodus 11:5 (id: 11010)

In much of the world, the issue of survival is addressed through children, and it is through the firstborn sons that the family line is carried on. If we have a child, there is a sense of satisfaction that even when we are dead, we will live on through our children. In the death of the Egyptian firstborn, God was showing that humans can do nothing by themselves to guarantee survival. Life is a gift, and that gift is in the hand of the one Lord, the “I Am.”

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 11:5

## Exodus 11:7 (id: 11011)

As stated explicitly in the fourth, fifth, seventh, and ninth plagues ([8:23](https://ref.ly/Exod8:23); [9:6](https://ref.ly/Exod9:6), [26](https://ref.ly/Exod9:26); [10:23](https://ref.ly/Exod10:23)), the Lord distinguished between his people and the Egyptians. These events clearly resulted from the express activity of God and were not just a chance collection of natural tragedies.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 11:7

## Exodus 11:8 (id: 11012)

Pharaoh had lost control. Moses was no longer asking; he was now in a position to dictate the terms of the Israelites’ departure from the country.

## Exodus 12:1–30 (id: 11013)

The Lord gave Moses instructions for the Passover meal and the Festival of Unleavened Bread ([12:14–20](https://ref.ly/Exod12:14-Exod12:20)), and Moses and the people observed the first Passover ([12:21–30](https://ref.ly/Exod12:21-Exod12:30)).

## Exodus 12:2 (id: 11023)

This month was the month Abib ([13:4](https://ref.ly/Exod13:4); [23:15](https://ref.ly/Exod23:15); [34:18](https://ref.ly/Exod34:18); [Deut 16:1](https://ref.ly/Deut16:1); later called by the Babylonian name, Nisan, [Neh 2:1](https://ref.ly/Neh2:1); [Esth 3:7](https://ref.ly/Esth3:7)), which falls within the months of March and April. Many cultures held festivals about this time of the year, celebrating the renewal of plant life. Israel’s festival celebrated the historic event in which God defeated death and rescued his people from bondage in Egypt.

blood: God could not simply exempt his people from this plague as he had preserved them from the other plagues. Death reigns in the world because of sin, and in light of God’s justice, sin cannot be ignored; it must be either punished or atoned for. Since the blood represents life ([Lev 17:11](https://ref.ly/Lev17:11)), it alone is acceptable for the forgiveness of sins ([Heb 9:22](https://ref.ly/Heb9:22)). As [Deut 6:9](https://ref.ly/Deut6:9) suggests, doorframes represent the totality of life as the place of going in and coming out.

without yeast: Israel needed unleavened bread for traveling (see [12:34](https://ref.ly/Exod12:34), [39](https://ref.ly/Exod12:39)), which the festival commemorated. Later, yeast was seen as an image of sin, probably because it is an agent of fermentation (“Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees,” [Matt 16:6](https://ref.ly/Matt16:6)). • cut off from the community: This means either death or expulsion from the community.

## Exodus 12:26–27 (id: 11021)

In the future, the Passover celebration would be a memorial reminding future generations of Israelites of God’s grace in providing them a way of escape from death. For more than 3,000 years the Jewish people have celebrated this great formative event in their history.

## Exodus 12:31–33 (id: 11025)

The same Pharaoh who had said that Moses would never again see his face and live (see [10:28](https://ref.ly/Exod10:28)) now asked for Moses to come and see him. Just as God had predicted, Pharaoh then ordered the Israelites to leave his land. He implicitly recognized the Lord’s power as he asked Moses to bless him. He never formally admitted that the Lord is God and that he, Pharaoh, was not.

## Exodus 12:37 (id: 11027)

Scholars often identify *Succoth* with Tell el\-Maskhutah. The mention of 600,000 men in [Numbers 1:46](https://ref.ly/Num1:46) suggests about 2\.5 million people in total. 

If this large number is literal, it presents some challenges: 

1. The camp area would cover 643 square kilometers (400 square miles).
2. A column of people 1,000 wide would stretch nearly a mile and take 20 hours to pass one point.
3. No other known armies in the ancient Near East were this large.

Scholars suggest two possible explanations: 

1. The number might be symbolic, showing that God greatly blessed Israel. Although unusual to us, this was acceptable in the ancient world.
2. The Hebrew word for “thousand” (*’elep*) might actually be “troop” (*’allup*). If so, it originally meant “600 *troops* of fighting men.” With each troop having about 100 men, the total population would be much smaller.

Despite the logistical issues, it is possible there were indeed 2\.5 million Israelites.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 12:37

## Exodus 12:38 (id: 11028)

A rabble of non\-Israelites: Some of these people later became disaffected and led the Israelites into complaining about their difficulties (see [Num 11:4](https://ref.ly/Num11:4)). We are never told their motivation for joining with the Israelites. Perhaps some had come to faith in the Lord as a result of the plagues. Others probably saw it as an opportunity for a better life elsewhere.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 12:38

## Exodus 12:40 (id: 11029)

According to the Septuagint and the Samaritan Pentateuch, 430 years would cover the full period from the promise to Abraham ([Gen 12](https://ref.ly/Gen12:1-Gen12:20); [15](https://ref.ly/Gen15:1-Gen15:21)) until the Exodus. Cp. [Gal 3:17](https://ref.ly/Gal3:17); see further Exodus Book Introduction, The Date of the Exodus.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 12:40

## Exodus 12:43–50 (id: 11030)

These extra instructions for celebrating Passover mainly refer to outsiders and foreigners ([12:43](https://ref.ly/Exod12:43); [12:48](https://ref.ly/Exod12:48)). The presence of non\-Israelite groups in the community might have led to these rules ([12:38](https://ref.ly/Exod12:38)). The main point was whether the person was willing to fully join Israel and obey the Lord by being circumcised.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 12:43–EXO 12:50

This rehearsal of the customs surrounding Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread sets the stage for discussing the dedication of the firstborn ([13:11–16](https://ref.ly/Exod13:11-Exod13:16)).

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 13:1–EXO 13:10

## Exodus 13:1–16 (id: 11037)

Like the Passover celebration, the practice of dedicating the firstborn memorialized what God did in the Passover event. Because he spared the firstborn, they now belonged to him and must be redeemed. The annual sacrifice and eating of the lamb symbolized what God would do in providing a substitute in his Son, Jesus Christ; we who deserve death must be redeemed with a price, the life of the Son.

The annual celebration of the Passover was a visible sign to identify oneself as the Lord’s possession. It was a mark of his ownership, the physical reinforcement of a spiritual reality. • Let it remind you always to recite this teaching of the Lord: The second part of the verse may be interpreted either as a statement to be recited (as in the NLT text) or simply as a description of the Lord’s work.

Even though they left Egypt like an army ready for battle ([13:18](https://ref.ly/Exod13:18); see also [12:51](https://ref.ly/Exod12:51)), it was only an appearance.

The Lord’s redemptive power was demonstrated as he brought Israel into a place where they were completely helpless and had to either rely on him for rescue or die. Although at the time it must have seemed completely foolish, Israel would thank God for the rest of its history for maneuvering them into such a spot (see [Ps 106:7–12](https://ref.ly/Ps106:7-Ps106:12); cp.

My great glory: The Hebrew word translated “glory” (kabod) connotes weightiness, significance, and reality. God demonstrated his authenticity while showing that all the political, military, and material glory of one of the greatest human cultures was only the thinnest of veils.

Whereas the Hebrews had been in a panic the night before, now the highly disciplined Egyptian army was thrown into disarray. They knew they were dealing with something far beyond their ability to comprehend or control.

## Exodus 14:22 (id: 11053)

As with the plagues, naturalistic explanations for this event are beside the point. A strong, steady wind blowing across a relatively shallow, contained body of water can change its depth dramatically, but that does not produce dry ground, with walls of water on each side. The Lord can intervene in nature and do with it as he wishes.

## Exodus 14:25 (id: 11054)

He twisted their chariot wheels: The ancient versions differ on the translation of this phrase. Perhaps there was deep sand where the water had been, and this broke the light wheels of the chariots. At any rate, the Egyptian charge through the sea failed, and they became terrified. • The Lord is fighting for them: Certainly by this time everyone in Egypt was aware of the special relationship between the Lord and his people.

## Exodus 15:1 (id: 11069)

Moses and the people: In this triumphant moment there was no division between them; they sang as one. • I will sing: The highly personal declarations of the first two verses emphasize the personal nature of God’s relation to humans. He is not an impersonal force, but relates to us as one person relates to another. The songs of thanks and hymns of praise in the Bible characteristically give the reason for the thanks or praise early in the piece (see [Ps 95:1–3](https://ref.ly/Ps95:1-Ps95:3); [96:1–4](https://ref.ly/Ps96:1-Ps96:4)). The reason for the song is that the Lord . . . has triumphed gloriously. The community’s faith in God through the dark night had been dramatically vindicated.

## Exodus 15:1–18 (id: 11061)

Scholars believe this song of rescue to be one of the oldest preserved examples of the Hebrew language, attesting to its importance in Israel’s thought and faith. It is divided into three stanzas: [15:1–5](https://ref.ly/Exod15:1-Exod15:5), [6–12](https://ref.ly/Exod15:6-Exod15:12), [13–18](https://ref.ly/Exod15:13-Exod15:18). The first stanza rejoices in the Lord’s personal rescue of Moses and his people (note the recurrence of the first\-person pronouns). The second exults in the great contrast between the Lord and the Egyptians. The third stanza reflects on what these events would mean for the future.

This statement is quoted in two other places, [Ps 118:14](https://ref.ly/Ps118:14) and [Isa 12:2](https://ref.ly/Isa12:2), which shows its importance. The “God of your father” ([Exod 3:6](https://ref.ly/Exod3:6)) had become my God. The Israelites now knew God for themselves and not just as a historical memory.

The Lord is a warrior: He will aggressively defend his own. He is not an oppressor, nor does he fight for the love of violence. But when his people are helpless before the enemy, whether external or internal, they can know that Yahweh, “He Who Is,” is their defender ([Isa 59:15–19](https://ref.ly/Isa59:15-Isa59:19); [63:1–6](https://ref.ly/Isa63:1-Isa63:6); [Rev 11:17–18](https://ref.ly/Rev11:17-Rev11:18)).

In light of God’s unfailing love and his might, there is no reason to doubt that he will be able to keep his promises. “Unfailing love” is a translation of the Hebrew word khesed*,* which speaks of the undeserved kindness and loyalty of a superior to an inferior. It is the most frequent descriptor of God’s character in the Old Testament (see [Ps 136](https://ref.ly/Ps136:1-Ps136:26)). If God had such a character but did not have the might to carry out his good intentions toward his people, his character would be of little value to us. The good news is that he has both a loving character and all power. • sacred home: God has chosen his people and gathered them to himself in order to dwell in their midst (see also [Exod 15:17](https://ref.ly/Exod15:17)).

What God had done to Egypt would have been common news throughout that part of the world (see Rahab’s report in [Josh 2:9–11](https://ref.ly/Josh2:9-Josh2:11), where the same imagery as in [Exod 15:15](https://ref.ly/Exod15:15), to melt away*,* is used).

These are the Lord’s instructions for gathering the food that he would provide in the wilderness. Enough was provided for each day, with a double amount provided on the sixth day so that the people would not have to gather any on the Sabbath (see [16:21–30](https://ref.ly/Exod16:21-Exod16:30)). The Israelites thus observed the Sabbath even before it was codified in the Decalogue. We instinctively resist a style of life in which it is necessary to depend on God each day to supply our needs. We wish to have supplies in advance so that we can feel independent. God was training the people for a life of faith (cp. [Matt 6:11](https://ref.ly/Matt6:11)).

Although the Sabbath was a day set apart for the Lord ([16:23](https://ref.ly/Exod16:23)), it was also the Lord’s gift to his people ([16:29](https://ref.ly/Exod16:29)). Rest and worship are not meant to be an obligation, but a privilege.

Jethro’s wise advice is a further example of God’s providence, although it was not given in a miraculous way. Jethro introduced Moses to a style of leadership that involved delegation of authority. It appears that Moses had been following an Egyptian style of leadership that was heavily hierarchical and based on circumstances. No Egyptian law code has yet been discovered.

They were to wash their clothing ([19:10](https://ref.ly/Exod19:10), [14](https://ref.ly/Exod19:14)) because God is pure. They were to prepare a boundary all around the mountain ([19:12–13](https://ref.ly/Exod19:12-Exod19:13)) and be careful not to cross it because God is holy. They were to abstain from having sexual intercourse ([19:15](https://ref.ly/Exod19:15)) because God is not a sexual being, and his blessings are not produced through sexual activity. Things that are natural and right under ordinary circumstances were to be set aside for the extraordinary purpose of concentrating on the Lord, the King who was about to appear before the people. Only their compliance with the second of these commands is specifically reported ([19:23](https://ref.ly/Exod19:23)), but it is safe to assume that they obeyed the other two as well since no negative response from the Lord is recorded. •[Hebrews 12:18–22](https://ref.ly/Heb12:18-Heb12:22) contrasts this experience at Mount Sinai with the believer’s experience at Mount Zion, “the heavenly Jerusalem.”

This corresponds to the introductory statement in the ancient covenant format. • all these instructions (literally *all these words*): When these statements are referred to elsewhere ([34:28](https://ref.ly/Exod34:28); [Deut 4:13](https://ref.ly/Deut4:13); [10:4](https://ref.ly/Deut10:4)), the Hebrew text refers to them as the “Ten Words.” These are not arbitrary commandments, but an explanation of God’s basic instructions for human living given by the Creator of human life.

## Exodus 20:1–23.33 (id: 11137)

The Sinai covenant follows very closely the form of the covenants, or *suzerain\-vassal* treaties, that great kings (the *suzerains*) in the ancient Near East offered to subject peoples (the *vassals*) as follows: (1\) An introduction named the great king who was offering the covenant ([20:1](https://ref.ly/Exod20:1)). (2\) A historical preamble set out the circumstances that had led to the offer of a treaty ([20:2](https://ref.ly/Exod20:2)). (3\) Stipulations, the terms upon which the two parties were to agree, typically included the king’s offer of protection from enemies and care during emergency, while the people would agree to behave in conformity to the preferences of that king. Exodus includes a brief setting forth of the terms of the covenant ([20:3–17](https://ref.ly/Exod20:3-Exod20:17)) followed by expanded terms (chs [21–23](https://ref.ly/Exod21:1-Exod23:33)). (4\) Another statement indicated where a written copy of the covenant should be kept and when it should be read ([24:7](https://ref.ly/Exod24:7); [25:16](https://ref.ly/Exod25:16)). (5\) The gods were called upon to witness the agreement (in Exodus, historical markers are substituted for the gods, [24:4](https://ref.ly/Exod24:4)). (6\) The blessings and curses were stated that would follow upon obedience or disobedience to the covenant ([23:20–33](https://ref.ly/Exod23:20-Exod23:33)). Utilizing the political form of the covenant, God invited his people into a formal relationship with himself as king while avoiding the pagan overtones that contaminated religious forms of the time. Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount ([Matt 5:1–7:29](https://ref.ly/Matt5:1-Matt7:29)) is a New Testament parallel to this section of Exodus, with the Beatitudes ([Matt 5:3–12](https://ref.ly/Matt5:3-Matt5:12)) paralleling the Ten Commandments.

## Exodus 20:2 (id: 11150)

This sentence corresponds to the preamble in the ancient covenant format. It gives the historical setting that makes such an agreement between two parties both possible and reasonable. We are told that the Lord your God was offering the covenant. It was not some unknown deity that offered this special relationship, but the God of Israel’s ancestors who had revealed his power and his care directly to them. Furthermore, that revelation was an act of gracious rescue on their behalf, demonstrating that he is the only God.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 20:2

## Exodus 20:3 (id: 11153)

Not recognizing any other god is the first step toward learning the truth that there are no other gods besides the Lord (see [Deut 4:35](https://ref.ly/Deut4:35); [6:4](https://ref.ly/Deut6:4); [Isa 43:10–11](https://ref.ly/Isa43:10-Isa43:11); [45:21–22](https://ref.ly/Isa45:21-Isa45:22)).

## Exodus 20:3–17 (id: 11152)

The terms of the covenant specify the behavior the people were expected to manifest if they were to be in a covenant with God. Only the first four instructions ([20:2–11](https://ref.ly/Exod20:2-Exod20:11)) relate directly to God, while the remaining six ([20:12–17](https://ref.ly/Exod20:12-Exod20:17)) have to do with human\-to\-human relationships. A covenant with God stipulates how we are to treat each other because God is profoundly ethical, and he expects us to manifest his character in all our relationships. Other law codes in the ancient Near East did not incorporate such absolute prohibitions, probably because polytheism mitigated against absolute principles. In contrast, covenants with a king did include absolute prohibitions because a single king could demand whatever he wished of his subjects. Here the single king is the sole Creator of the universe, who truly has authority to state absolute principles, demands, and prohibitions.

## Exodus 20:4 (id: 11154)

Not making an image of God is the first step toward recognizing that he is transcendent—that he is the Creator of the universe and distinct from it. To represent God as something in creation was inevitably to end up worshiping the creation rather than the Creator, and this immorality had deadly consequences ([Rom 1:18–25](https://ref.ly/Rom1:18-Rom1:25)).

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 20:4

## Exodus 20:5–6 (id: 11155)

jealous God: God is passionately opposed to our prostituting ourselves with false gods (see [Josh 24:19–20](https://ref.ly/Josh24:19-Josh24:20)). • in the third and fourth generations . . . for a thousand generations: It is important to keep both sides of this equation together. God does not punish children for their parents’ sins. Rather, he is saying that our sins affect future generations of descendants. But he is also restricting the natural effects of those sins to three or four generations, while graciously extending the effects of obedience to a thousand generations (see also [34:6–7](https://ref.ly/Exod34:6-Exod34:7); [Deut 7:9](https://ref.ly/Deut7:9)). • reject (literally *hate*): The Hebrew words commonly translated “love” ([Exod 20:6](https://ref.ly/Exod20:6)) and “hate” are difficult to translate into English because they include an act of the will as well as the emotional element we are familiar with. In biblical thinking, to “love” is to choose something and to act consistently in accord with that choice. To “hate” is to reject something and to act in ways consistent with that choice. The choice is connected to emotion: Feeling expresses itself in choices, and our choices show how we really feel.

## Exodus 20:7 (id: 11156)

In Hebrew, one’s name connotes nature and character (see study note on 3:13–22). To make the name of God empty (NLT, misuse) is to do anything that makes him appear insignificant or worthless. One way to do this is to invoke his name in an oath we do not mean to keep. But there are other, even more significant ways to bring shame on God’s name (see [Num 20:12](https://ref.ly/Num20:12); [Amos 2:7](https://ref.ly/Amos2:7); cp. [Matt 6:9](https://ref.ly/Matt6:9)).

## Exodus 20:8–11 (id: 11157)

The Sabbath day is kept holy when it is dedicated to the Lord ([20:10](https://ref.ly/Exod20:10)). Whatever belongs exclusively to God shares his character. This is not to say that the other six days are unholy, but simply that they are for ordinary work ([20:9](https://ref.ly/Exod20:9)). On this day set apart, we are reminded that it is not our work that supplies our needs. Our needs are supplied by God as an act of his grace ([20:6](https://ref.ly/Exod20:6)).

## Exodus 20:12 (id: 11140)

To honor your father and mother is to recognize that you are not self\-sufficient and self\-existent. This is one important step on the road to humility. Arrogance may produce notoriety, but humility and gratitude are the foundations of a long, full life. Both Jesus and Paul refer to this command (see [Matt 15:4](https://ref.ly/Matt15:4); [Mark 7:10](https://ref.ly/Mark7:10); [Eph 6:1–3](https://ref.ly/Eph6:1-Eph6:3)).

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 20:12

## Exodus 20:12–17 (id: 11139)

The remaining six instructions all have to do with human relationships. Many of the stipulations of the covenant with God relate to how people treat each other. This connection of ethical behavior with religious duty is unique in the Old Testament world. There are several ethical law codes known in the ancient Near East, and several of these predate Moses, but all of them are imposed by a human king and have little to do with religion. The pagan gods, meanwhile, were patently unethical and untrustworthy, unlike the God of Israel, whose people worship him by treating others as he does. See also [Matt 19:17–19](https://ref.ly/Matt19:17-Matt19:19).

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 20:12–EXO 20:17

## Exodus 20:13 (id: 11141)

murder: This is the correct rendering of the Hebrew word. There is another word that connotes mere killing. Taking human life is not prohibited, per se, but the intentional killing of another for personal reasons is prohibited. This principle tells us that God values our individual, physical lives. Jesus expanded on this command in [Matt 5:21–26](https://ref.ly/Matt5:21-Matt5:26).

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 20:13

## Exodus 20:14 (id: 11142)

adultery: Here this term represents all sexual sins, among which adultery most clearly indicates breaking faith. Adulterers satisfy their sexual desires as they please, and they break faith with their spouse in so doing. Jesus expanded on this command in [Matt 5:27–30](https://ref.ly/Matt5:27-Matt5:30).

## Exodus 20:15 (id: 11143)

Stealing is another way of saying that I have an absolute right to my own way, whether I have earned it or not. From the divine side, the prohibition says that God values us even down to our possessions.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 20:15

## Exodus 20:16 (id: 11144)

Not telling a lie can be a very individual act, and even a prideful one. But refusing to testify falsely against your neighbor is an unselfish act, in which your neighbor’s reputation and well\-being is more important to you than your own.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 20:16

## Exodus 20:17 (id: 11145)

This final principle circles back to the first, for “a greedy person is an idolater” ([Col 3:5](https://ref.ly/Col3:5)). Covetousness is the worship of this world, the belief that possessions, especially those my neighbor possesses, will give me lasting happiness. To believe this is to break one’s covenant of absolute loyalty to God, who alone supplies our needs. See also [Rom 7:7](https://ref.ly/Rom7:7).

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 20:17

## Exodus 20:18–21 (id: 11146)

The people were very conscious of their sinfulness before a holy God and begged Moses to stand between them and God. Moses pointed out that God’s goal was neither to overawe them nor to destroy them. Rather, he wanted their awe of him to keep them from sinning ([20:20](https://ref.ly/Exod20:20)). Jesus is the ultimate mediator between God and people ([1 Tim 2:5](https://ref.ly/1Tim2:5)).

This interlude is about access to God. The first part ([20:18–21](https://ref.ly/Exod20:18-Exod20:21)) deals with the need for a mediator between the people and God. In [20:22–26](https://ref.ly/Exod20:22-Exod20:26), we find the appropriate form for an altar in the interval before God revealed his plans for a more permanent sanctuary (see [25:1–30:28](https://ref.ly/Exod25:1-Exod30:28)).

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 20:18–EXO 20:26

## Exodus 20:22–26 (id: 11149)

The Lord is transcendent, as shown by his speaking to the people in a disembodied voice from heaven ([20:22](https://ref.ly/Exod20:22)). This would have two effects upon their practice: They were not to use silver or gold to make gods in human form (idols*,* [20:23](https://ref.ly/Exod20:23)), and they were not to carve stones for an altar ([20:25](https://ref.ly/Exod20:25)). Perhaps this is because they would be tempted to carve stone gods in the process. The altar was to be made of earth ([20:24](https://ref.ly/Exod20:24)) and uncut stones ([20:25](https://ref.ly/Exod20:25)). • The prohibition against revealing one’s nakedness ([20:26](https://ref.ly/Exod20:26)) might have been to separate Israelite religious practice from the nature worship around them. Sexual activity was an integral part of many Canaanite rituals.

## Exodus 21:1–11 (id: 11158)

Slavery was a fact of life in the ancient world. In some cases, it was the only resort for those who were destitute. In much of the ancient world, people who were slaves felt that the gods had abandoned them. But the Lord cares about those who are in this helpless condition, so his covenant people must care also. Ultimately, the revelation that Jesus Christ had died for all people everywhere would make the practice of slavery untenable ([Gal 3:28](https://ref.ly/Gal3:28)).

## Exodus 21:1–23.19 (id: 11159)

The statements found here are in the typical case\-law format of ancient Near Eastern law codes. This format begins with a hypothetical situation introduced by the word “if.” The following statement of what is to be done in such a case is introduced by “then.” While some cases are grouped into categories in these chapters, there is little attempt to separate personal, civil, or ceremonial laws from one another. For God, life is not compartmentalized. All of life is lived in relationship to God, so all kinds of behavior signify whether we are in loving submission to him or in defiance of him.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 21:4–EXO 21:6

## Exodus 21:7–9 (id: 11171)

A female slave was treated differently from a male, possibly because it was understood that she was sold to become a concubine. For such a woman to be released after seven years would not be just. She would either have to return to her father (who clearly did not want her, having previously sold her), marry (an unlikely prospect for a former concubine), or become a prostitute. Thus, it was best for her to remain in the home of her master. Presumably, if a man bought a girl to be his son’s wife ([21:9](https://ref.ly/Exod21:9)), it was understood that the purchase price was not actually buying her but was the equivalent of a bride\-price. Typically, a young man wishing to marry a girl had to give her father a gift of some sort, either money or a gift in kind (see [22:16](https://ref.ly/Exod22:16); [Gen 24:53](https://ref.ly/Gen24:53)). A woman for whom a bride\-price had been paid was not a slave.

The crimes of murder, kidnapping, and dishonoring one’s parents warranted the death penalty. A murderer forfeits his own life, and human life is so precious that even an accidental death cannot be overlooked. The place of refuge (see [Num 35:6–28](https://ref.ly/Num35:6-Num35:28)) was a place where an accidental killer could go so that the family of the deceased could not take vengeance (see study notes on Num 35:6–34).

The law of retaliation (the *lex talionis*) called for a penalty that matched the injury inflicted on a victim. But this law also served to limit the punishment so it was not more severe than the original injury. Cp. [Matt 5:38–39](https://ref.ly/Matt5:38-Matt5:39).

While all the people were camped around the Tabernacle in the wilderness, this requirement did not create any problems. Later, when the people were dispersed throughout the land at a distance from the Tabernacle (later the Temple), it was more difficult. The stipulation seems to have been intended to keep the people from building local worship centers, which would splinter them as a people and allow for pagan influences on the worship of Yahweh. Sadly, these stipulations were not carefully carried out (see, e.g., [2 Kgs 23:21–23](https://ref.ly/2Kgs23:21-2Kgs23:23)).

Blood symbolized life ([Lev 17:11–14](https://ref.ly/Lev17:11-Lev17:14); [Deut 12:23](https://ref.ly/Deut12:23)), so blood must not be mixed with yeast*,* which was not normally included in offerings (see study note on Lev 2:11). • The fat*,* considered the best part of the offering, was to be burned at once (see [Lev 3:3–5](https://ref.ly/Lev3:3-Lev3:5)).

If the people obeyed the covenant rules, God promised to protect them from enemies and illness and give them land to own ([23:22–23](https://ref.ly/Exod23:22-Exod23:23),[25–26](https://ref.ly/Exod23:25-Exod23:26), [27–31](https://ref.ly/Exod23:27-Exod23:31)). These promises depended on complete loyalty to God (Yahweh). Worshiping the gods of the peoples expelled from the land would be an act of rebellion ([23:21](https://ref.ly/Exod23:21); [24](https://ref.ly/Exod23:24), [32–33](https://ref.ly/Exod23:32-Exod23:33)).

At that time, “the sins of the Amorites” had not yet run their course. Now they had. God was not arbitrarily dispossessing the Amorites (i.e., the Canaanites) but was using his people, the Israelites, to judge their wickedness.

These instructions first indicate the materials the Israelites could contribute for the construction of the Tabernacle ([25:3–7](https://ref.ly/Exod25:3-Exod25:7)). The instructions then move from the center outward, beginning with the Ark of the Covenant ([25:10–22](https://ref.ly/Exod25:10-Exod25:22)) and concluding with the courtyard ([27:9–19](https://ref.ly/Exod27:9-Exod27:19)). Two items, the altar of incense in the sanctuary and the washbasin in the courtyard, are included later ([30:1–10](https://ref.ly/Exod30:1-Exod30:10), [17–21](https://ref.ly/Exod30:17-Exod30:21)), in the section relating to the priesthood, perhaps because their use was especially related to functions of the priests.

## Exodus 25:1–40.38 (id: 11208)

Unlike our churches, the Tabernacle functioned primarily as a residence or palace of God, the divine king, rather than as a place for people to congregate. In this respect, churches are more like the later Jewish synagogues (see also study note on 40:2). This last section of Exodus completes the revelation of God necessary for the people of Israel to come out of the theological darkness that had held them in bondage. This final section includes instructions for building the Tabernacle (chs [25–31](https://ref.ly/Exod25:1-Exod31:18)), the story of the gold calf (a wrong attempt to secure God’s presence, chs [32–34](https://ref.ly/Exod32:1-Exod34:35)), and the report of building the Tabernacle (the proper way to secure God’s presence, chs [35–40](https://ref.ly/Exod35:1-Exod40:38)). God’s ultimate goal in delivering the people from bondage was to share his presence with them. Because of his holiness, that presence could only be experienced in his way, not through the pagan way of human manipulation. The construction of the Tabernacle is reported here, even though some of the instructions in Leviticus were actually given before this event (see [40:1–2](https://ref.ly/Exod40:1-Exod40:2); [Lev 25:1](https://ref.ly/Lev25:1); [27:34](https://ref.ly/Lev27:34); [Num 7:1](https://ref.ly/Num7:1)). This event expresses the goal of the entire Exodus sequence, which is God taking up residence among his people.

## Exodus 25:10–22 (id: 11209)

an Ark of acacia wood: In translating the plans for the Ark of the Covenant, the NLT continues to use the word Ark because of its traditional associations. However, *ark* is simply an archaic English word meaning “box.” The Ark was Israel’s “covenant box.” It was the most significant item in the whole complex, because it was there that God made his presence available ([25:22](https://ref.ly/Exod25:22)). The presence of the stone tablets of the covenant in the box ([25:16](https://ref.ly/Exod25:16), [21](https://ref.ly/Exod25:21)) underlined the truth that God reveals himself in the context of a mutually binding commitment between himself and his people.

The carrying poles were there so that no one would touch this representation of God’s devastating holiness. Later, a death occurred when someone instinctively reached out to steady the Ark as it was being moved from one place to another (see [2 Sam 6:6–7](https://ref.ly/2Sam6:6-2Sam6:7)).

## Exodus 25:22 (id: 11213)

I will meet with you there: The Ark was located in the innermost part of the sanctuary ([26:33](https://ref.ly/Exod26:33)), which was in effect God’s throne room (see study note on Lev 16:2). In a comparable pagan sanctuary, one would find an idol in this location. The Tabernacle had no idol, only a box that physically represented the covenant faithfulness and grace of God. God meets his people in that context, not in the context of idolatry. An idol reflects the belief that a deity is continuous with the created order and that it can be manipulated with the right ritual. It assumes that we can secure blessings from the deity without regard to our own character or commitment. But God is completely distinct from this world, and he cannot be manipulated in any way. He wants to bless us, but those blessings can only be given to those who receive his grace as a gift and surrender to him in trust.

The lampstand of pure, hammered gold stood on the south side of the Holy Place ([26:35](https://ref.ly/Exod26:35)). It showed the light of God’s presence to his people. The lamps ([25:37](https://ref.ly/Exod25:37)) were flat dishes containing olive oil. A wick extended into the oil and hung down from a lip on one side of the dish. The dishes, resting on the upturned almond blossoms ([25:33](https://ref.ly/Exod25:33)), were to be turned so that all their wicks faced the center of the room ([25:37](https://ref.ly/Exod25:37)). The total number of lamps is not clear. Although seven lamps are mentioned in [25:37](https://ref.ly/Exod25:37), there seem to be 22 lamp cups in [25:33–34](https://ref.ly/Exod25:33-Exod25:34).

## Exodus 26:1–37 (id: 11220)

The Tabernacle proper (as distinct from the surrounding courtyard) was not very large. It was approximately 15 feet wide and 45 feet long. The supporting framework consisted of 48 vertical frames, 15 feet high and 27 inches wide ([26:16](https://ref.ly/Exod26:16)). They were made of acacia wood overlaid with gold ([26:15](https://ref.ly/Exod26:15), [29](https://ref.ly/Exod26:29)). The frames were locked together with horizontal crossbars to form a three\-sided rectangle with an open end ([26:26–28](https://ref.ly/Exod26:26-Exod26:28)). Two large linen curtains (each composed of five smaller ones) were then linked together into one and draped across the top of this framework. The combined total was long enough to hang down on the sides and rear ([26:1–6](https://ref.ly/Exod26:1-Exod26:6)), forming coverings for the walls as well as the roof. Over the linen curtain was draped a curtain of goat\-hair cloth constructed in the same way. It was three feet wider and six feet longer than the linen curtain ([26:7–13](https://ref.ly/Exod26:7-Exod26:13)), so that it hung down further than the linen curtain on all sides. Over these two curtains were two protective coverings, one of tanned ram skins and one of fine goatskin leather ([26:14](https://ref.ly/Exod26:14)). The space so enclosed was divided in two with another beautifully embroidered curtain hanging crosswise on four posts of acacia wood. The resulting two spaces were the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place ([26:31–33](https://ref.ly/Exod26:31-Exod26:33)).

Five of the six\-foot strips were joined, probably by being sewn together, making one continuous piece of cloth 42 feet long and 30 feet wide. When joined to each other with the loops and clasps ([26:5–6](https://ref.ly/Exod26:5-Exod26:6)), the two cloths formed a single unit 42 feet by 60 feet.

Archaeology has shown that the horns of the altar were protrusions sticking up from the corners of the structure. Perhaps they kept wood and offerings from falling off (see [Ps 118:27](https://ref.ly/Ps118:27)). They also seem to have had a theological significance, representing God’s gracious care. A person who held onto the horns of the altar was requesting leniency in judgment (see [1 Kgs 1:50–51](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:50-1Kgs1:51); [2:28](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:28)).

The magnificence of these garments is in keeping with the grandeur of the Tabernacle, which functioned as a portable earthly palace for God. There would come a day when Jesus Christ, the true High Priest, would enter the Most Holy Place once for all, and the distinction between priests and people would fade away ([Heb 10:11–22](https://ref.ly/Heb10:11-Heb10:22)).

The ephod was a kind of apron consisting of front and back pieces joined by shoulder straps ([28:7](https://ref.ly/Exod28:7)) and secured by a decorative sash ([28:8](https://ref.ly/Exod28:8), [27–28](https://ref.ly/Exod28:27-Exod28:28)). Perhaps it is mentioned first because it was understood to be the distinctive high priestly garment. The fact that Gideon later made a gold ephod ([Judg 8:27](https://ref.ly/Judg8:27)) suggests that the garment was thought to have special powers.

names on his shoulders (cp. [Isa 9:6](https://ref.ly/Isa9:6)): The badge of office on the shoulder indicated what the person was really carrying. Thus, the high priest represented the people before God, and with his royal garments he represented the glory of God before the people.

## Exodus 28:15–30 (id: 11241)

More attention is given to the chestpiece than to any other item, suggesting the importance attached to it. It apparently symbolized the priest’s representation of Israel ([28:17–21](https://ref.ly/Exod28:17-Exod28:21), [29](https://ref.ly/Exod28:29)) and was a container for the Urim and Thummim*,* by which God made his will known ([28:30](https://ref.ly/Exod28:30)). The chestpiece represented the totality of the high priest’s tasks of bringing the people to God and bringing God’s word to the people.

## Exodus 28:29 (id: 11242)

The high priest would go into the Holy Place (the outer room of the sanctuary) to trim the lamp, replace the bread on the table, and replenish the incense on the altar that stood outside the Most Holy Place.

## Exodus 28:30 (id: 11243)

The Urim and Thummim (Hebrew terms that might translate as *lights* \[or *curses*] *and perfections*) were apparently a pair of stones that were thrown down to get a yes or no answer from God. No physical description of these objects exists; their use is further explained in [Num 27:21](https://ref.ly/Num27:21); [Deut 33:8](https://ref.ly/Deut33:8); [1 Sam 28:6](https://ref.ly/1Sam28:6); [Ezra 2:63](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:63); and [Neh 7:65](https://ref.ly/Neh7:65).

## Exodus 28:31–35 (id: 11244)

The robe worn under the ephod is described. The bells signaled that the priest was still moving and had not been struck dead by God’s presence (see [Lev 10:1–2](https://ref.ly/Lev10:1-Lev10:2)). Jewish tradition tells us that the priest had a cord tied to his ankle so that if he died in the Holy Place ([Exod 28:35](https://ref.ly/Exod28:35)), his body could be dragged out.

## Exodus 28:36–38 (id: 11245)

Like all the other elements of the high priest’s clothing and activities, the medallion worn on the front of the turban was to remind the people that God is holy, and his holiness had implications for their entering his presence. God wished to dwell with his people, but his holiness would destroy them unless he took preventative steps. God determines the way into his presence; we do not. The central question of the Bible is how a sinful people can live in the presence of a holy God so that God can share his holy character with them. Ultimately, the answer is provided in Jesus Christ, the Holy One of God who is the perfect mediator ([Luke 4:34](https://ref.ly/Luke4:34); [Heb 9:11–15](https://ref.ly/Heb9:11-Heb9:15)). He did not die only to rescue us from the consequences of our sin, but so that God can live in us, reproducing his holy character in us ([Eph 2:10](https://ref.ly/Eph2:10); [4:22](https://ref.ly/Eph4:22); [Phil 1:27](https://ref.ly/Phil1:27); [1 Pet 1:13–16](https://ref.ly/1Pet1:13-1Pet1:16)).

## Exodus 28:42–43 (id: 11247)

Expressions of sexuality were a frequent part of pagan religion, as worshipers attempted to control the powers of fertility. In some cases, priests served their deities in the nude. Not even a hint of sexual manipulation was acceptable in the worship of the Lord. His blessings could not be achieved through magical manipulation. Thus, even unintentional display of the genitals was guarded against.

with no defects: The same word is translated “blameless” and “perfect” in reference to human and divine behavior (e.g., [Gen 17:1](https://ref.ly/Gen17:1); [Ps 18:30](https://ref.ly/Ps18:30), [32](https://ref.ly/Ps18:32)). The sacrifice is representative of God’s own character and the character he seeks in humans.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 29:1

## Exodus 29:1–37 (id: 11249)

Moses was required to consecrate (or *sanctify*) Aaron and his sons to serve the Lord. This emphasis on making the priests holy is found throughout the ceremonies ([29:6](https://ref.ly/Exod29:6), [21](https://ref.ly/Exod29:21), [28](https://ref.ly/Exod29:28), [29](https://ref.ly/Exod29:29), [34](https://ref.ly/Exod29:34), [36](https://ref.ly/Exod29:36), [37](https://ref.ly/Exod29:37)). They were set apart not merely for service, but to serve a God whose nature is utterly different from that of fallen, sinful humans. The report of how these instructions were carried out is found in [Lev 8](https://ref.ly/Lev8:1-Lev8:36).

forever: The fulfillment of this promise, as with the one to David, clearly leads beyond the merely human. Aaron’s own behavior was less than sterling (e.g., ch [32](https://ref.ly/Exod32:1-Exod32:35); [Num 11](https://ref.ly/Num11:1-Num11:35)), and the behavior of his sons and descendants was no better ([1 Sam 2:12–17](https://ref.ly/1Sam2:12-1Sam2:17); [Isa 28:7](https://ref.ly/Isa28:7); [Ezek 8:15–16](https://ref.ly/Ezek8:15-Ezek8:16); [Mal 2:1–9](https://ref.ly/Mal2:1-Mal2:9)). The promise could only find its ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ (see [Heb 7:26](https://ref.ly/Heb7:26); [9:11](https://ref.ly/Heb9:11)). • To ordain (literally *to fill the hands*) means to give a person a task to perform.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 29:9

## Exodus 29:10–34 (id: 11250)

The consecration of the priesthood of Aaron involved a sin offering ([29:10–14](https://ref.ly/Exod29:10-Exod29:14)), a burnt offering ([29:15–18](https://ref.ly/Exod29:15-Exod29:18)), and an ordination offering ([29:19–28](https://ref.ly/Exod29:19-Exod29:28)). The same patterns established here are expanded to the regular offerings of the people (see [29:38–46](https://ref.ly/Exod29:38-Exod29:46); [Lev 1–5](https://ref.ly/Lev1:1-Lev5:19)). In all three cases, Aaron and his sons lay their hands on \[the] head of the sacrificial animals ([Exod 29:10](https://ref.ly/Exod29:10), [15](https://ref.ly/Exod29:15), [19](https://ref.ly/Exod29:19)), indicating that sin is a matter of life and death, and that it can only be removed by a death. Because it represents life, blood is prominent in these ceremonies ([29:12](https://ref.ly/Exod29:12), [16](https://ref.ly/Exod29:16), [20](https://ref.ly/Exod29:20), [21](https://ref.ly/Exod29:21)).

This ordination offering is very similar to the peace (or fellowship) offering later described in [Lev 3](https://ref.ly/Lev3:1-Lev3:17). The fat was burned as a gift to the Lord, but the breast and the thigh, after having been dedicated to the Lord by lifting them up before him ([29:24–26](https://ref.ly/Exod29:24-Exod29:26)), became the portion for the priests to eat ([29:26–28](https://ref.ly/Exod29:26-Exod29:28)). In the regular peace offering, the remainder of the meat was to be eaten by the person making the offering in a fellowship meal ([Lev 7:11–18](https://ref.ly/Lev7:11-Lev7:18)), as the priests did here ([Exod 29:31–34](https://ref.ly/Exod29:31-Exod29:34)).

The point throughout this entire section ([25:1–40:38](https://ref.ly/Exod25:1-Exod40:38)) is that God intends to meet his people’s need for some tangible representation of his presence, but it must be done in the way he has commanded. He, not we, determines the terms by which we come to him.

This is underlined by the death sentence for disobedience (see also [Num 15:32–36](https://ref.ly/Num15:32-Num15:36)). This is not to say that followers of God must always punish those who commit these offenses in this way; but here at the outset, it was vital to make this truth clear (see [Acts 5:1–11](https://ref.ly/Acts5:1-Acts5:11)).

Refusal to wait on God is often a cause of sin (see [1 Sam 13:7–13](https://ref.ly/1Sam13:7-1Sam13:13); [Isa 30:15–18](https://ref.ly/Isa30:15-Isa30:18)).

the shape of a calf: The idol might actually have been an image of a bull, like the images of the Egyptian god Amon\-Re that the people had known in Egypt. The bull represented power, domination, and fertility. The writer would then be using the term calf as a way of expressing contempt for the idol. Alternatively, Aaron might have made a calf, feeling that this sin was not as serious as if the idol were a full\-sized bull. • these are the gods who brought you out: The people attributed to the idol what they had just said that Moses had done ([32:1](https://ref.ly/Exod32:1)). Idolatry expresses the belief that the divine realm and the visible world are continuous with one another. This worldview sees it as possible to lay hold of divine power through ritual manipulation of the god by means of the idol. God had been insisting that the very opposite is true: God is *not* contained in or restrained by his creation, and his blessings cannot be procured by manipulating creation, either ritually or otherwise. The blessings of God are for those who surrender their own efforts to make themselves secure and come to him using the ways and means that he has decreed.

Aaron attempted to control the process, but he was actually abdicating leadership by simply doing what he thought the people wanted. • Although the idol was referred to as “the gods” ([32:4](https://ref.ly/Exod32:4)), Aaron also implied that it was a physical manifestation of the Lord.

Your people whom you brought from the land of Egypt: God here attributes his own work to Moses, which suggests that he was testing Moses, giving him an opportunity to make the same mistake the people had made ([32:1](https://ref.ly/Exod32:1)). God was not “tempting” Moses in the sense of “seducing him to do evil” (see [Jas 1:13–14](https://ref.ly/Jas1:13-Jas1:14)), but he was putting Moses into a situation where he was faced with a clear choice that could take him in opposing directions (cp.

He knew that God is just and faithful and that he would not deliver people only to destroy them ([32:12](https://ref.ly/Exod32:12)). He refused to accept the invitation to become the father of a great nation, since that would involve God’s breaking his promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob ([32:13](https://ref.ly/Exod32:13)). Moses had learned who God really is.

In response to Moses’ argument, the Lord changed his mind. This is not the picture of a raging tyrant who is, with great difficulty, finally persuaded to back down. The Lord is much more inclined to be merciful than to insist on vengeance, and he invites those who are near him, like Moses, to give him an occasion for his mercy through faithful intercession.

When Moses actually saw what was going on, he was much less calm than he had been on the mountain. He smashed the tablets ([32:15–19](https://ref.ly/Exod32:15-Exod32:19)), destroyed the calf ([32:20](https://ref.ly/Exod32:20)), confronted Aaron ([32:21–25](https://ref.ly/Exod32:21-Exod32:25)), and had the ringleaders killed ([32:26–29](https://ref.ly/Exod32:26-Exod32:29)).

While the act of smashing the tablets might simply have been a reaction of fury, it might also have been Moses’ way of saying that the covenant with God was now irrevocably broken.

Aaron denied responsibility even though he himself had made the molds and poured the gold ([32:4](https://ref.ly/Exod32:4)). Aaron wanted Moses to believe that it all “just happened” ([32:24](https://ref.ly/Exod32:24)) and that he had no choice because the people were so evil ([32:22](https://ref.ly/Exod32:22)).

Moses had asked God to spare the people, but now he called on those who followed the Lord to kill those who had sinned. The Levites ([32:26](https://ref.ly/Exod32:26)) were willing to confront the sin that Aaron had let loose. Although Moses commanded them to kill everyone ([32:27](https://ref.ly/Exod32:27)), the number 3,000 ([32:28](https://ref.ly/Exod32:28)) makes it clear that the word *everyone* had a restricted meaning. The reference to your own sons and brothers suggests that as Aaron had led in the idolatry, many of the Levites had led in the worship of the idol, and they were the ones that the rest of the Levites killed. Aaron may have escaped because God had already designated him as high priest ([28:1](https://ref.ly/Exod28:1)).

Neither his justice nor his sovereignty are underlined here, as true as those attributes are. If God were merely just, the Old Testament would have ended at this point, or it would have picked up and started again with an entirely new family.

Here Moses took his request a step further and asked God to travel with the people and make them his own special possession (see [19:5–6](https://ref.ly/Exod19:5-Exod19:6)).

Not only would the making of a treaty involve recognizing those peoples’ gods (because ancient treaties would call upon the gods as witnesses; see study note on 20:1–23:33), but the very existence of the treaties would predispose the Israelites to accept the ways of their treaty partners ([34:12](https://ref.ly/Exod34:12), [15–16](https://ref.ly/Exod34:15-Exod34:16)).

As a result, Moses blessed them instead of pronouncing judgment upon them, as when they had tried to meet their need for God’s presence in their own ways ([32:27](https://ref.ly/Exod32:27)).

## Exodus 40:1–33 (id: 11387)

The report on setting up the Tabernacle begins with the Lord’s commands to do so ([40:1–15](https://ref.ly/Exod40:1-Exod40:15)) and continues with the report on how Moses obeyed those commands ([40:16–33](https://ref.ly/Exod40:16-Exod40:33)). • The repeated statement that Moses did everything just as the Lord had commanded him ([40:16](https://ref.ly/Exod40:16), [19](https://ref.ly/Exod40:19), [21](https://ref.ly/Exod40:21), [23](https://ref.ly/Exod40:23), [25](https://ref.ly/Exod40:25), [27](https://ref.ly/Exod40:27),[29](https://ref.ly/Exod40:29), [32](https://ref.ly/Exod40:32)) is in radical contrast to Aaron’s self\-serving statement in [32:22–24](https://ref.ly/Exod32:22-Exod32:24). God wishes to share his presence with us, but his holiness is such that this can occur only if we renounce our own efforts to secure his presence and gifts.

## Exodus 40:34–38 (id: 11390)

The climax of the Exodus occurred when the glory of the Lord filled the Tabernacle. God’s goal from the outset was not merely to deliver his people from their bondage, but to bring them into a relationship with himself. Their real need was to know God personally in their lives. Without that, the Promised Land would not be a land of promise. Now it would be, because the glory that had been on Mount Sinai was in Israel’s midst; it would not be left behind but would travel with them wherever they might go.

## Exodus 40:38 (id: 11391)

the whole family of Israel: This description is reminiscent of the way the book began (see [1:1–7](https://ref.ly/Exod1:1-Exod1:7)). Jacob’s family had become slaves in Egypt. What a dramatic change had occurred! They were no longer slaves. They were now in a position to be a blessing to the earth, as God had promised to Abraham generations earlier ([Gen 12:3](https://ref.ly/Gen12:3)).
