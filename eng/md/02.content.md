## Exodus 1:1 (id: 10991)

Israel is the name God had given to Jacob*,* son of Isaac and grandson of Abraham ([Gen 32:28](https://ref.ly/Gen32:28)). • Many years earlier, Jacob and his family had moved to Egypt, seeking refuge from severe drought (see [Gen 46:1–7](https://ref.ly/Gen46:1-Gen46:7)). Thanks to Joseph’s wisdom and leadership (see [Gen 41:25–49](https://ref.ly/Gen41:25-Gen41:49)), a steady grain supply had been stored (see [Gen 42:1–2](https://ref.ly/Gen42:1-Gen42:2); [45:5–7](https://ref.ly/Gen45:5-Gen45:7)).

## Exodus 1:1–22 (id: 10982)

The need for deliverance was obviously related to the Israelites’ condition (the Egyptians worked the people of Israel without mercy*,* [1:13](https://ref.ly/Exod1:13)); it also was related to promises God had made to the patriarchs years earlier. The Lord had promised Abraham that his descendants would be a great nation, living in freedom in the land of Canaan. At this point, Abraham’s descendants were slaves in Egypt under a pharaoh determined to decimate them as a people. God would have to rescue the people if his promises were to be kept.

God accomplished good for his people in spite of the brothers’ sin. With Joseph present in Egypt, God could use him to save the lives of the chosen people from the famine that would have destroyed them ([Gen 42:1–2](https://ref.ly/Gen42:1-Gen42:2); [50:19–20](https://ref.ly/Gen50:19-Gen50:20)).

## Exodus 1:6–7 (id: 10995)

The long sojourn of Jacob’s family in Egypt was part of a divine design. God had told Abraham that his descendants could not receive the land of Canaan for 400 years—until the sin of the Canaanites had come to its full fruition ([Gen 15:13–16](https://ref.ly/Gen15:13-Gen15:16)). Even in Egypt, God’s promises were at work, and the descendants of aged Abraham and barren Sarah multiplied … greatly as God had said ([Gen 15:5](https://ref.ly/Gen15:5)), because God blessed them ([Ps 105:24](https://ref.ly/Ps105:24)).

## Exodus 1:8–10 (id: 10996)

From about 1650 to 1550 BC, Semitic invaders ruled northern Egypt, where the Israelites lived. The Egyptians called these rulers "shepherd kings" or *Hyksos*. Semitic peoples were ancient groups from the Middle East and North Africa, known for their shared languages (such as Hebrew, Aramaic, or Arabic) and cultural traditions.

Many scholars think these kings supported the Israelites, who might have allied with them. Egypt finally expelled the invaders around 1540 BC. The new rulers of Egypt's 18th Dynasty probably did not trust any remaining Semites, including the Israelites.

Archaeologists have identified *Pithom and Rameses* with the modern cities of Tell el\-Maskhutah and Qantir. Ancient remains show people built these cities during the Late Bronze period (1550–1250 BC), when the Israelites were also present.

## Exodus 1:14 (id: 10986)

The only stone that the Egyptians could obtain for building purposes came from the far south of the country. Therefore, in the north where the Hebrews were settled, only the most important state and religious buildings were made of stone. The rest were constructed with mortar and bricks made of durable clay with a binder such as seashells or straw mixed in. After being sun\-dried in a form, these materials were surprisingly durable—especially in a land such as Egypt, where there was little rainfall or humidity.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 1:14

## Exodus 1:15 (id: 10987)

Pharaoh is a title for the Egyptian ruler, not a personal name. • The origins of the word Hebrew are unclear. As used by the Egyptians and Philistines in reference to the Israelites, it was apparently a derogatory term for a despised underclass. • Whatever the number of Hebrew people (see study note on 12:37), there were clearly more than two midwives for the whole nation. Probably the two named here, Shiphrah and Puah*,* are representatives of the whole group. The differences between Pharaoh and the midwives are dramatic. He had great political and military power; they had none. He had great official prestige; they had very little. He was a man; they were women. He was of the ruling people; they were slaves. He was rich; they were poor. They could easily have been cowed into obedience, but they were not.

watch as they deliver (literally *look upon the two stones*): The Hebrew might refer to a birthstool or genitalia. • If the baby is a boy, kill him; if it is a girl, let her live: Such selective genocide would not completely deprive the Egyptians of a free labor source. When grown, the girls would be married to slaves from other people groups, effectively destroying Hebrew cohesion while keeping the supply of slaves as high as possible.

## Exodus 1:17 (id: 10989)

The midwives … refused to obey the mighty Egyptian king because they feared God more than they feared Pharaoh ([1:21](https://ref.ly/Exod1:21)). Fear of the Lord (reverent awe of him as the almighty Creator and Judge) is the foundation of true knowledge and of wisdom ([Prov 1:7](https://ref.ly/Prov1:7); [9:10](https://ref.ly/Prov9:10)). The Lord is a friend to those who fear him ([Ps 25:14](https://ref.ly/Ps25:14)). The midwives understood that the Lord has more power than any human being.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 1:17

## Exodus 1:19 (id: 10990)

It might trouble us that the midwives were not candid in giving their main reason for keeping the boy babies alive. Comprehensive honesty is less important to God than absolute faithfulness to him and to his believing community.

[Chapter 1](https://ref.ly/Exod1:1-Exod1:22) established the need for rescue; ch [2](https://ref.ly/Exod2:1-Exod2:25) describes the preparation of Moses, the rescuer. God used the destruction of the Hebrew boy babies to ensure that the rescuer would be trained (see study note on 2:10) for his task.

## Exodus 2:3 (id: 11133)

Papyrus reeds grew plentifully along the many streams into which the Nile River divided in the delta region of northern Egypt. They were light and flexible, well\-suited for basket weaving. It is possible that Moses’ mother placed the basket in the water exactly where it was most likely to be found by the Egyptian princess.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 2:3
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Exodus 2:5–6 (id: 11134)

Much like the Ganges River in modern India, the Nile was understood by the Egyptians to be a goddess who had life\-giving and healing properties. When Pharaoh’s daughter came down to bathe in the river*,* she was not merely washing but completing her morning devotions. The discovery of the baby floating on the river, in the embrace of the Nile goddess (as she saw it), would be very significant to her. It is also natural for a young woman to feel sorry for a crying baby. The combination of factors may account for her rescuing the child, though she recognized that he was Hebrew (Hebrews and Egyptians practiced circumcision differently).

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 2:5–EXO 2:6
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Exodus 2:7–9 (id: 11135)

It is evidence of God’s grace and sovereignty that Pharaoh’s daughter ironically paid Moses’ mother to nurse her own baby rather than having him killed according to Pharaoh’s command. The narrator seems to imply that the princess realized who the baby’s mother was (since she didn’t ask any embarrassing questions). If so, the two women chose to understand each other while maintaining a legal fiction. Moses was saved because God was at work, not because anyone was fooled.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 2:7–EXO 2:9
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Exodus 2:10 (id: 11120)

God not only saved Moses’ life for his future calling, he also arranged for him to receive administrative, military, and leadership training from the oppressors of his people. A pharaoh was expected to sire as many children as was physically possible to prove his power. Male offspring were placed in civil and military positions. It is very likely that the adopted son of a princess would have had such experiences (see [Acts 7:22](https://ref.ly/Acts7:22)). • Moses: The princess gave the child an Egyptian name that is found in the full names of many prominent Egyptians, including the 18th Dynasty pharaohs named *Ahmose* (1550–1525 BC) and *Thutmose* (1504–1390 BC). By naming the child Moses (meaning “to give birth”), the princess was perhaps saying that the Nile, revered as a source of life, had given birth to the baby. The Israelites drew a connection between the name *Moses* and the similar sounding Hebrew term mashah*,* which means “to lift out.”

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 2:10
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Exodus 2:11–12 (id: 11121)

Moses had a privileged upbringing as compared with the toil and hardship of his own people, the Hebrews, but he was willing to identify with them and help them to the point of jeopardizing his own privileges.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 2:11–EXO 2:12
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Exodus 2:11–15 (id: 11122)

This section addresses Moses’ first abortive attempt to rescue Israel in his own strength. This incident shows Moses’ courage and decisiveness, but it also shows his tendency to assume the responsibility himself, which would later have tragic effects in his life ([Num 20:1–13](https://ref.ly/Num20:1-Num20:13)). Moses’ concern for his people’s welfare was good; his timing and manner did not accord with God’s plan.

## Exodus 2:13 (id: 11123)

Moses, who had put himself at risk to prevent an Egyptian from beating a Hebrew, must have been especially angered to see a Hebrew beating up a fellow Hebrew.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 2:13
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Exodus 2:14 (id: 11124)

The arrogant response of the Hebrew man, “Who appointed you to be our prince and judge?” foreshadows how the rest of the Hebrews would respond to Moses in later years—they would not thank him for his efforts on their behalf. If Moses were to succeed, he would have to depend solely on a sense of his divine calling.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 2:14
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Exodus 2:15 (id: 11125)

Moses fled: By trying to rescue Israel himself rather than through God’s help, Moses made himself a fugitive rather than a leader in Egypt, forestalling God’s purposes for him. Moses’ life was drastically changed as a consequence of his actions (cp. [Num 20:9–13](https://ref.ly/Num20:9-Num20:13); [Deut 3:23–29](https://ref.ly/Deut3:23-Deut3:29)). • Midian was located on both sides of the Gulf of Aqaba—in the southern Sinai Peninsula and on the western edge of the Arabian Peninsula. A major trade route from southern Arabia passed through this dry and barren area. Its people seem to have been nomadic shepherds and traders (see [Gen 37:28](https://ref.ly/Gen37:28)). It was a good place for a fugitive to disappear.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 2:15

## Exodus 2:16 (id: 11127)

The priest of Midian was named Reuel ([2:18](https://ref.ly/Exod2:18)), but later he is called Jethro ([18:1](https://ref.ly/Exod18:1)). It was common for a person to have both an official name and a personal name, though in this case it is not clear which is which. Perhaps, like Melchizedek ([Gen 14:18](https://ref.ly/Gen14:18)), he represented an indigenous religious class that had not fallen prey to a pagan religion. Reuel’s actions in bringing an offering and sacrifices to God ([Exod 18:12](https://ref.ly/Exod18:12)) suggest that this was so.

This passage further reveals Moses’ concern for the oppressed and tells of his transition to a new land ([2:18–22](https://ref.ly/Exod2:18-Exod2:22)). He married, had a child, and lived there for forty years ([Acts 7:30](https://ref.ly/Acts7:30)). From a human perspective, there was no way for the Israelites to be rescued through Moses, but it is the divine perspective that matters. The end of this section ([Exod 2:23–25](https://ref.ly/Exod2:23-Exod2:25)) tells us that God had not forgotten his people; he was only waiting for the time to act ([2:25](https://ref.ly/Exod2:25)).

Here and in [17:6](https://ref.ly/Exod17:6) and [33:6](https://ref.ly/Exod33:6) the Hebrew text uses the proper name *Horeb.* Both names presumably refer to the same mountain, so the NLT consistently uses Sinai.

The first deals with the call itself, while the second addresses the full implications of accepting that call.

Technically, the angel of the Lord is the Lord’s officially authorized envoy, but the expression may be used more broadly of other visible manifestations of the Lord (see [Gen 16:9–13](https://ref.ly/Gen16:9-Gen16:13); [Judg 13:3](https://ref.ly/Judg13:3), [6](https://ref.ly/Judg13:6), [21–22](https://ref.ly/Judg13:21-Judg13:22)). • In the Bible, blazing fire often represents God’s transcendent holiness (see [Exod 19:18](https://ref.ly/Exod19:18); [Gen 15:17](https://ref.ly/Gen15:17); [1 Kgs 18:38–39](https://ref.ly/1Kgs18:38-1Kgs18:39); [Isa 33:14](https://ref.ly/Isa33:14)). • didn’t burn up: This may show that God does not wish to consume the vehicle that he sets ablaze for his purposes.

The soil around the bush was holy ground, while the soil on the bottom of Moses’ sandals was common. The common cannot touch the holy without being transformed or destroyed (see “Clean, Unclean, and Holy” Theme Note). At the outset of the Exodus, God was making it plain that he is absolutely “other” than his creation, a reality that cannot be overlooked in a proper divine\-human relationship. The word holy occurs only a few times in the Bible prior to [Exod 3:5](https://ref.ly/Exod3:5). It now becomes the central descriptor of God in the Old Testament. In other Semitic languages, the same root occurs infrequently. It does not describe a moral quality in these other languages but simply what is “other than” human. The pagan gods, for instance, were “holy” only in the sense of being “other”—they did everything humans do, good and evil, but on a larger scale. In the Bible, by contrast, moral perfection is a central idea of the term *holy.* The one true God is the only being in the universe who truly stands apart from this world and is worthy of being called “holy” in this general sense. The true God is perfectly consistent and moral in his character. Here, at the burning bush, God revealed his otherness. Later at Sinai, he revealed his moral character in his requirements for those who would be his covenant partners (see [Exod 19:6](https://ref.ly/Exod19:6); [20:1–23:33](https://ref.ly/Exod20:1-Exod23:33); see also [Lev 11:45](https://ref.ly/Lev11:45); [1 Pet 1:13–16](https://ref.ly/1Pet1:13-1Pet1:16)).

In the Bible, a sign often occurred after a person or a nation had already had to decide whether to act in faith or not (see [Isa 7:14](https://ref.ly/Isa7:14)). A sign cannot create faith where there is none (see [Matt 12:39](https://ref.ly/Matt12:39); [16:4](https://ref.ly/Matt16:4)). Rather, it encourages the one who has exercised the faith he or she already has.

Moses’ second protest was that he had inadequate knowledge. He did not know God’s name. This might mean that God’s personal name had not yet been revealed (see study notes on 6:2–3). It is also possible that Moses meant he did not know the secret, magic formula that a man of power might have been expected to make use of. Interest in such things was common in the ancient Near East. God’s direct response is almost a riddle, but the majority of his answer is a statement of his faithfulness in the past and a demonstration of his knowledge of the future. There is nothing magical about the name *Yahweh.* Knowledge of secret formulas and magic powers is not the issue; the issue is the character of God and his lordship of history. The reason there is “something about that name” is because of the incomparable character and nature of the one who bears it.

## Exodus 3:15 (id: 11277)

Yahweh is probably a form of the Hebrew verb “to be,” so it could mean “he causes to be,” or “he who is,” or “I am.” Later Jews were not permitted to speak God’s name aloud, so the Hebrew text supplies the vowels from the word ’adonay (which means “lord” or “master”) whenever God’s proper name, YHWH, appears. In oral reading, the Hebrew reader would pronounce *’adonay,* even though the written text is *YHWH.* We do not know the pronunciation of the divine name. The widely used *Yahweh* is an informed guess. The English word “Jehovah” is an artificial term made by combining the vowels of ’adonay with the consonants Y\-H\-W\-H. In the NLT, this name is usually translated “Lord” (with small capitals), but it is transliterated “Yahweh” in the few instances, like this verse, where a point is made about the name itself. Also in [6:2–3](https://ref.ly/Exod6:2-Exod6:3); [15:3](https://ref.ly/Exod15:3); [33:19](https://ref.ly/Exod33:19); [34:5–6](https://ref.ly/Exod34:5-Exod34:6).

This incident is shrouded in mystery. That Zipporah responded immediately and circumcised her son suggests that she and Moses had discussed the possibility of doing so previously and had decided it was not necessary. Why would having an uncircumcised son lead to God’s intent to kill the rescuer he had carefully prepared and called? Perhaps if Moses had arrived in Egypt claiming to represent the God of the Israelites’ ancestors and yet had not done the one thing God had commanded of his followers to this point ([Gen 17:10](https://ref.ly/Gen17:10)), then the people would have been less inclined to follow God in a radically exclusive way.

## Exodus 6:2–3 (id: 11409)

I am Yahweh … El\-Shaddai: Here the NLT transliterates the divine names *Yahweh* and *El\-Shaddai* because God was emphasizing that he was now using a different name than the name by which he was known to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. To assist the English reader, the translators have also supplied the English terms usually used for these Hebrew terms: “the Lord” and “God Almighty.” • I did not reveal my name, Yahweh, to them: The name Yahweh in fact appears frequently in Genesis (translated “the Lord”). Two solutions are possible: (1\) The name Yahweh was not known to the patriarchs, but Moses, the author of Genesis, was inspired to insert that name in those places in Genesis where God’s grace and his nature as covenant\-keeper were apparent. While the patriarchs might have known the name Yahweh, it is possible that they had never seen God’s nature displayed as it was in the Exodus and the Sinai covenant. In Hebrew, a person’s name has a broader significance than it does in English. People’s names were intended to reflect their character and nature, not just serve as a label (see, e.g., [Pss 8:1](https://ref.ly/Ps8:1), [9](https://ref.ly/Ps8:9); [148:13](https://ref.ly/Ps148:13)). Here reveal is a Hebrew word often translated “to know,” which implies intimate knowledge and experience. In this case, the patriarchs knew God’s name, but they did not know and experience his nature fully as he revealed himself in the Exodus.

Once again, God forcefully linked his promises to the patriarchs (Abraham’s family) with what he was about to do. God’s work in history shows his faithfulness. He has made promises, and he will keep them. God also wished to reveal more of himself than he had been able to do with the patriarchs. This generation would know more of God and his intentions than Abraham had, particularly regarding the implications of the covenant ([6:4–5](https://ref.ly/Exod6:4-Exod6:5)). Why does God redeem ([6:6](https://ref.ly/Exod6:6))? Why did he reveal himself to Abraham in the first place? God wanted the Israelites to be his own people, and he wanted to be their God ([6:7](https://ref.ly/Exod6:7)). God’s goal is for humanity to be in a lovingly submissive covenant relationship with him, where we can be what he made us to be.

## Exodus 6:7 (id: 11412)

Then you will know that I am the Lord: The Hebrew word translated *know* is always based on experience and relationship. The same word is used to describe human sexual relations. To *know* God as Yahweh is not just to know abstract facts about him, but to be in a relationship with him in which we are always learning who he is and what he wants us to do. This is the only true rescue from the human predicament of sin described in [Gen 3–11](https://ref.ly/Gen3:1-Gen11:32). The importance of “knowing the Lord” in the book of Exodus is seen in its recurrence, especially in [Exod 5–18](https://ref.ly/Exod5:1-Exod18:27) ([5:2](https://ref.ly/Exod5:2); [7:5](https://ref.ly/Exod7:5), [17](https://ref.ly/Exod7:17); [8:10](https://ref.ly/Exod8:10), [22](https://ref.ly/Exod8:22); [9:29](https://ref.ly/Exod9:29); [10:2](https://ref.ly/Exod10:2); [11:7](https://ref.ly/Exod11:7); [14:4](https://ref.ly/Exod14:4), [18](https://ref.ly/Exod14:18); [16:6](https://ref.ly/Exod16:6), [12](https://ref.ly/Exod16:12); [18:11](https://ref.ly/Exod18:11)).

## Exodus 6:14–30 (id: 11405)

This genealogical interlude places Moses and Aaron among the families of Israel. That it is an interlude is clear because [6:30](https://ref.ly/Exod6:30) is a repetition of[6:12](https://ref.ly/Exod6:12). There is a recurring emphasis in Exodus on Yahweh as the God of the ancestors, both explicitly (from [3:6](https://ref.ly/Exod3:6)on) and implicitly (from [1:1](https://ref.ly/Exod1:1) on). What was about to happen was not an unrelated action by some new god who was devaluing impotent older gods (a typical theme in ancient pagan literature). Unlike pagan gods, whose only purpose is personal power, and who are in constant conflict among themselves, the true God has a single, overarching purpose: He wants his creation to find its fulfillment in proper relation to him. Although he enacts that purpose in ever\-expanding displays of creativity, the new activities are always consistent with what he has already revealed of himself. Moses and Aaron did not suddenly appear out of the unknown, but were an integral part of that same people to whom God first revealed himself and through whom he was about to give an even grander revelation. The genealogies of Jesus have a similar purpose ([Matt 1:1–16](https://ref.ly/Matt1:1-Matt1:16); [Luke 3:23–38](https://ref.ly/Luke3:23-Luke3:38)).

This genealogy of Levi’s descendants focuses on Aaron and Moses*;* four generations are given in the genealogy from Levi to Aaron and Moses (cp. [Gen 15:16](https://ref.ly/Gen15:16)). Since the people of Israel had lived in Egypt for 430 years (see [Exod 12:40–41](https://ref.ly/Exod12:40-Exod12:41); [Gen 15:13](https://ref.ly/Gen15:13)), this genealogy skips numerous generations. In [Gen 46:11](https://ref.ly/Gen46:11), Gershon, Kohath, and Merari are listed as the actual sons of Levi who moved down to Egypt with their father and the rest of Jacob’s family. Amram*’*s wife, Jochebed, gave birth to his sons ([Exod 6:20](https://ref.ly/Exod6:20)). This is very concrete language, so there is no reason to believe that there were unnamed generations between Amram and Aaron and Moses. This suggests that the unnamed generations were between Kohath (son of Levi) and Amram (father of Aaron and Moses).

The focus is clearly on Aaron’s line through Eleazar, who received the high priesthood. The fact that Aaron and Korah were cousins makes it easier to see why Aaron’s elevation to high priesthood was so galling to Korah (see [Num 16:1–3](https://ref.ly/Num16:1-Num16:3)); family rivalry is nothing new. The later rebellion might explain why Korah and his sons are given particular mention in this genealogy.

The second plague was the plague of frogs ([8:2](https://ref.ly/Exod8:2)).

Pharaoh attempted to bargain with God. He wanted to obey partially while still retaining control. James says of such people, “Their loyalty is divided between God and the world” ([Jas 1:8](https://ref.ly/Jas1:8)), and such a person cannot receive anything from the Lord.

Moses pointed out the impossibility of what Pharaoh was asking on the grounds of the Egyptians’ own prejudice: They considered all Semites to be uncultured and uncouth (see [Gen 43:32](https://ref.ly/Gen43:32)). • The Hebrews were leaving Egypt in order to worship God (see, e.g., [Exod 5:1](https://ref.ly/Exod5:1); [7:16](https://ref.ly/Exod7:16); [8:1](https://ref.ly/Exod8:1), [20](https://ref.ly/Exod8:20)).

It must have been increasingly tempting to let the Egyptians continue to experience the results of their king’s stubbornness, but Moses was willing to plead with God not to leave them in a permanent state of grief and distress.

The fifth plague was against the livestock. As with the withholding of flies from the area where the Hebrews lived ([8:22–23](https://ref.ly/Exod8:22-Exod8:23)), the distinction between the livestock of the Israelites and that of the Egyptians ([9:4](https://ref.ly/Exod9:4)) shows that a natural explanation of this event is insufficient, even if the previous plagues contributed. The Egyptians, like many in the ancient Near East, worshiped the ram, the goat, and the bull as representing power and fertility. These animals had no power before the Lord, in whom true power resides.

The seventh plague was a hailstorm ([9:18](https://ref.ly/Exod9:18)). It rains in Egypt only a few days each year, and hail and thunderstorms are largely unknown, so this storm would have been terrifying.

God had not destroyed Pharaoh and Egypt in a single blow, as he could have done. Rather he had spared them ([Exod 9:16](https://ref.ly/Exod9:16)), giving them an opportunity to submit to his power.

At this time he was known as Amon\-Re. He was supreme over all the other gods and was considered to be the ultimate source of life. The Lord showed that the sun’s light is completely under his control; he could shut it off from Egypt proper, while leaving it to shine in Goshen in the northeast part of the country ([10:23](https://ref.ly/Exod10:23); see study note on 9:1–7).

Scholars often identify *Succoth* with Tell el\-Maskhutah. The mention of 600,000 men in [Numbers 1:46](https://ref.ly/Num1:46) suggests about 2\.5 million people in total. 

If this large number is literal, it presents some challenges: 

1. The camp area would cover 643 square kilometers (400 square miles).
2. A column of people 1,000 wide would stretch nearly a mile and take 20 hours to pass one point.
3. No other known armies in the ancient Near East were this large.

Scholars suggest two possible explanations: 

1. The number might be symbolic, showing that God greatly blessed Israel. Although unusual to us, this was acceptable in the ancient world.
2. The Hebrew word for “thousand” (*’elep*) might actually be “troop” (*’allup*). If so, it originally meant “600 *troops* of fighting men.” With each troop having about 100 men, the total population would be much smaller.

In the second phase of preparation, the people received commands that would prepare them to receive God’s covenant. They were to wash their clothing ([19:10](https://ref.ly/Exod19:10), [14](https://ref.ly/Exod19:14)) because God is pure. They were to prepare a boundary all around the mountain ([19:12–13](https://ref.ly/Exod19:12-Exod19:13)) and be careful not to cross it because God is holy. They were to abstain from having sexual intercourse ([19:15](https://ref.ly/Exod19:15)) because God is not a sexual being, and his blessings are not produced through sexual activity. Things that are natural and right under ordinary circumstances were to be set aside for the extraordinary purpose of concentrating on the Lord, the King who was about to appear before the people. Only their compliance with the second of these commands is specifically reported ([19:23](https://ref.ly/Exod19:23)), but it is safe to assume that they obeyed the other two as well since no negative response from the Lord is recorded. •[Hebrews 12:18–22](https://ref.ly/Heb12:18-Heb12:22) contrasts this experience at Mount Sinai with the believer’s experience at Mount Zion, “the heavenly Jerusalem.”

The Sinai covenant follows very closely the form of the covenants, or *suzerain\-vassal* treaties, that great kings (the *suzerains*) in the ancient Near East offered to subject peoples (the *vassals*) as follows: (1\) An introduction named the great king who was offering the covenant ([20:1](https://ref.ly/Exod20:1)). (2\) A historical preamble set out the circumstances that had led to the offer of a treaty ([20:2](https://ref.ly/Exod20:2)). (3\) Stipulations, the terms upon which the two parties were to agree, typically included the king’s offer of protection from enemies and care during emergency, while the people would agree to behave in conformity to the preferences of that king. Exodus includes a brief setting forth of the terms of the covenant ([20:3–17](https://ref.ly/Exod20:3-Exod20:17)) followed by expanded terms (chs [21–23](https://ref.ly/Exod21:1-Exod23:33)). (4\) Another statement indicated where a written copy of the covenant should be kept and when it should be read ([24:7](https://ref.ly/Exod24:7); [25:16](https://ref.ly/Exod25:16)). (5\) The gods were called upon to witness the agreement (in Exodus, historical markers are substituted for the gods, [24:4](https://ref.ly/Exod24:4)). (6\) The blessings and curses were stated that would follow upon obedience or disobedience to the covenant ([23:20–33](https://ref.ly/Exod23:20-Exod23:33)). Utilizing the political form of the covenant, God invited his people into a formal relationship with himself as king while avoiding the pagan overtones that contaminated religious forms of the time. Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount ([Matt 5:1–7:29](https://ref.ly/Matt5:1-Matt7:29)) is a New Testament parallel to this section of Exodus, with the Beatitudes ([Matt 5:3–12](https://ref.ly/Matt5:3-Matt5:12)) paralleling the Ten Commandments.

This sentence corresponds to the preamble in the ancient covenant format. It gives the historical setting that makes such an agreement between two parties both possible and reasonable. We are told that the Lord your God was offering the covenant. It was not some unknown deity that offered this special relationship, but the God of Israel’s ancestors who had revealed his power and his care directly to them. Furthermore, that revelation was an act of gracious rescue on their behalf, demonstrating that he is the only God.

The terms of the covenant specify the behavior the people were expected to manifest if they were to be in a covenant with God. Only the first four instructions ([20:2–11](https://ref.ly/Exod20:2-Exod20:11)) relate directly to God, while the remaining six ([20:12–17](https://ref.ly/Exod20:12-Exod20:17)) have to do with human\-to\-human relationships. A covenant with God stipulates how we are to treat each other because God is profoundly ethical, and he expects us to manifest his character in all our relationships. Other law codes in the ancient Near East did not incorporate such absolute prohibitions, probably because polytheism mitigated against absolute principles. In contrast, covenants with a king did include absolute prohibitions because a single king could demand whatever he wished of his subjects. Here the single king is the sole Creator of the universe, who truly has authority to state absolute principles, demands, and prohibitions.

Not making an image of God is the first step toward recognizing that he is transcendent—that he is the Creator of the universe and distinct from it.

jealous God: God is passionately opposed to our prostituting ourselves with false gods (see [Josh 24:19–20](https://ref.ly/Josh24:19-Josh24:20)). • in the third and fourth generations … for a thousand generations: It is important to keep both sides of this equation together. God does not punish children for their parents’ sins. Rather, he is saying that our sins affect future generations of descendants. But he is also restricting the natural effects of those sins to three or four generations, while graciously extending the effects of obedience to a thousand generations (see also [34:6–7](https://ref.ly/Exod34:6-Exod34:7); [Deut 7:9](https://ref.ly/Deut7:9)). • reject (literally *hate*): The Hebrew words commonly translated “love” ([Exod 20:6](https://ref.ly/Exod20:6)) and “hate” are difficult to translate into English because they include an act of the will as well as the emotional element we are familiar with. In biblical thinking, to “love” is to choose something and to act consistently in accord with that choice. To “hate” is to reject something and to act in ways consistent with that choice. The choice is connected to emotion: Feeling expresses itself in choices, and our choices show how we really feel.

In Hebrew, one’s name connotes nature and character (see study note on 3:13–22). To make the name of God empty (NLT, misuse) is to do anything that makes him appear insignificant or worthless. One way to do this is to invoke his name in an oath we do not mean to keep. But there are other, even more significant ways to bring shame on God’s name (see [Num 20:12](https://ref.ly/Num20:12); [Amos 2:7](https://ref.ly/Amos2:7); cp. [Matt 6:9](https://ref.ly/Matt6:9)).

The remaining six instructions all have to do with human relationships. Many of the stipulations of the covenant with God relate to how people treat each other. This connection of ethical behavior with religious duty is unique in the Old Testament world. There are several ethical law codes known in the ancient Near East, and several of these predate Moses, but all of them are imposed by a human king and have little to do with religion. The pagan gods, meanwhile, were patently unethical and untrustworthy, unlike the God of Israel, whose people worship him by treating others as he does.

The altar was to be made of earth ([20:24](https://ref.ly/Exod20:24)) and uncut stones ([20:25](https://ref.ly/Exod20:25)). • The prohibition against revealing one’s nakedness ([20:26](https://ref.ly/Exod20:26)) might have been to separate Israelite religious practice from the nature worship around them.

Slavery was a fact of life in the ancient world. In some cases, it was the only resort for those who were destitute. In much of the ancient world, people who were slaves felt that the gods had abandoned them. But the Lord cares about those who are in this helpless condition, so his covenant people must care also.

A female slave was treated differently from a male, possibly because it was understood that she was sold to become a concubine. For such a woman to be released after seven years would not be just. She would either have to return to her father (who clearly did not want her, having previously sold her), marry (an unlikely prospect for a former concubine), or become a prostitute. Thus, it was best for her to remain in the home of her master. Presumably, if a man bought a girl to be his son’s wife ([21:9](https://ref.ly/Exod21:9)), it was understood that the purchase price was not actually buying her but was the equivalent of a bride\-price. Typically, a young man wishing to marry a girl had to give her father a gift of some sort, either money or a gift in kind (see [22:16](https://ref.ly/Exod22:16); [Gen 24:53](https://ref.ly/Gen24:53)).

God’s command was that every man in Israel must appear before … the Lord ([23:17](https://ref.ly/Exod23:17)), that is, at the Tabernacle, three times each year. While all the people were camped around the Tabernacle in the wilderness, this requirement did not create any problems. Later, when the people were dispersed throughout the land at a distance from the Tabernacle (later the Temple), it was more difficult. The stipulation seems to have been intended to keep the people from building local worship centers, which would splinter them as a people and allow for pagan influences on the worship of Yahweh. Sadly, these stipulations were not carefully carried out (see, e.g., [2 Kgs 23:21–23](https://ref.ly/2Kgs23:21-2Kgs23:23)).

Unlike our churches, the Tabernacle functioned primarily as a residence or palace of God, the divine king, rather than as a place for people to congregate. In this respect, churches are more like the later Jewish synagogues (see also study note on 40:2). This last section of Exodus completes the revelation of God necessary for the people of Israel to come out of the theological darkness that had held them in bondage. This final section includes instructions for building the Tabernacle (chs [25–31](https://ref.ly/Exod25:1-Exod31:18)), the story of the gold calf (a wrong attempt to secure God’s presence, chs [32–34](https://ref.ly/Exod32:1-Exod34:35)), and the report of building the Tabernacle (the proper way to secure God’s presence, chs [35–40](https://ref.ly/Exod35:1-Exod40:38)). God’s ultimate goal in delivering the people from bondage was to share his presence with them. Because of his holiness, that presence could only be experienced in his way, not through the pagan way of human manipulation. The construction of the Tabernacle is reported here, even though some of the instructions in Leviticus were actually given before this event (see [40:1–2](https://ref.ly/Exod40:1-Exod40:2); [Lev 25:1](https://ref.ly/Lev25:1); [27:34](https://ref.ly/Lev27:34); [Num 7:1](https://ref.ly/Num7:1)).

an Ark of acacia wood: In translating the plans for the Ark of the Covenant, the NLT continues to use the word Ark because of its traditional associations. However, *ark* is simply an archaic English word meaning “box.” The Ark was Israel’s “covenant box.” It was the most significant item in the whole complex, because it was there that God made his presence available ([25:22](https://ref.ly/Exod25:22)). The presence of the stone tablets of the covenant in the box ([25:16](https://ref.ly/Exod25:16), [21](https://ref.ly/Exod25:21)) underlined the truth that God reveals himself in the context of a mutually binding commitment between himself and his people.

I will meet with you there: The Ark was located in the innermost part of the sanctuary ([26:33](https://ref.ly/Exod26:33)), which was in effect God’s throne room (see study note on Lev 16:2). In a comparable pagan sanctuary, one would find an idol in this location. The Tabernacle had no idol, only a box that physically represented the covenant faithfulness and grace of God. God meets his people in that context, not in the context of idolatry. An idol reflects the belief that a deity is continuous with the created order and that it can be manipulated with the right ritual. It assumes that we can secure blessings from the deity without regard to our own character or commitment. But God is completely distinct from this world, and he cannot be manipulated in any way. He wants to bless us, but those blessings can only be given to those who receive his grace as a gift and surrender to him in trust.

The Tabernacle proper (as distinct from the surrounding courtyard) was not very large. It was approximately 15 feet wide and 45 feet long. The supporting framework consisted of 48 vertical frames, 15 feet high and 27 inches wide ([26:16](https://ref.ly/Exod26:16)). They were made of acacia wood overlaid with gold ([26:15](https://ref.ly/Exod26:15), [29](https://ref.ly/Exod26:29)). The frames were locked together with horizontal crossbars to form a three\-sided rectangle with an open end ([26:26–28](https://ref.ly/Exod26:26-Exod26:28)). Two large linen curtains (each composed of five smaller ones) were then linked together into one and draped across the top of this framework. The combined total was long enough to hang down on the sides and rear ([26:1–6](https://ref.ly/Exod26:1-Exod26:6)), forming coverings for the walls as well as the roof. Over the linen curtain was draped a curtain of goat\-hair cloth constructed in the same way. It was three feet wider and six feet longer than the linen curtain ([26:7–13](https://ref.ly/Exod26:7-Exod26:13)), so that it hung down further than the linen curtain on all sides. Over these two curtains were two protective coverings, one of tanned ram skins and one of fine goatskin leather ([26:14](https://ref.ly/Exod26:14)). The space so enclosed was divided in two with another beautifully embroidered curtain hanging crosswise on four posts of acacia wood. The resulting two spaces were the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place ([26:31–33](https://ref.ly/Exod26:31-Exod26:33)).

Like the frames of the Tabernacle, the square altar of burnt offerings was made of acacia wood overlaid with metal. However, in keeping with the other features outside the sanctuary, it was overlaid with bronze ([27:2–3](https://ref.ly/Exod27:2-Exod27:3); see [27:10](https://ref.ly/Exod27:10), [17](https://ref.ly/Exod27:17), [19](https://ref.ly/Exod27:19)).

Archaeology has shown that the horns of the altar were protrusions sticking up from the corners of the structure. Perhaps they kept wood and offerings from falling off (see [Ps 118:27](https://ref.ly/Ps118:27)). They also seem to have had a theological significance, representing God’s gracious care. A person who held onto the horns of the altar was requesting leniency in judgment (see [1 Kgs 1:50–51](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:50-1Kgs1:51); [2:28](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:28)).

These glorious and beautiful ([28:2](https://ref.ly/Exod28:2)) garments for Aaron were to distinguish him as a priest set apart (Hebrew qadash*,* “consecrated”) for \[the Lord’s] service ([28:3](https://ref.ly/Exod28:3)). The magnificence of these garments is in keeping with the grandeur of the Tabernacle, which functioned as a portable earthly palace for God. There would come a day when Jesus Christ, the true High Priest, would enter the Most Holy Place once for all, and the distinction between priests and people would fade away ([Heb 10:11–22](https://ref.ly/Heb10:11-Heb10:22)). Until that time, human mediators were needed to symbolize the wonderful thing that God was planning to do in the hearts, lives, and behaviors of those with whom he shared his presence.

Perhaps it is mentioned first because it was understood to be the distinctive high priestly garment. The fact that Gideon later made a gold ephod ([Judg 8:27](https://ref.ly/Judg8:27)) suggests that the garment was thought to have special powers.

names on his shoulders (cp. [Isa 9:6](https://ref.ly/Isa9:6)): The badge of office on the shoulder indicated what the person was really carrying. Thus, the high priest represented the people before God, and with his royal garments he represented the glory of God before the people.

Like all the other elements of the high priest’s clothing and activities, the medallion worn on the front of the turban was to remind the people that God is holy, and his holiness had implications for their entering his presence. God wished to dwell with his people, but his holiness would destroy them unless he took preventative steps. God determines the way into his presence; we do not. The central question of the Bible is how a sinful people can live in the presence of a holy God so that God can share his holy character with them. Ultimately, the answer is provided in Jesus Christ, the Holy One of God who is the perfect mediator ([Luke 4:34](https://ref.ly/Luke4:34); [Heb 9:11–15](https://ref.ly/Heb9:11-Heb9:15)). He did not die only to rescue us from the consequences of our sin, but so that God can live in us, reproducing his holy character in us ([Eph 2:10](https://ref.ly/Eph2:10); [4:22](https://ref.ly/Eph4:22); [Phil 1:27](https://ref.ly/Phil1:27); [1 Pet 1:13–16](https://ref.ly/1Pet1:13-1Pet1:16)).

Expressions of sexuality were a frequent part of pagan religion, as worshipers attempted to control the powers of fertility. In some cases, priests served their deities in the nude.

Thus, even unintentional display of the genitals was guarded against.

The consecration of the priesthood of Aaron involved a sin offering ([29:10–14](https://ref.ly/Exod29:10-Exod29:14)), a burnt offering ([29:15–18](https://ref.ly/Exod29:15-Exod29:18)), and an ordination offering ([29:19–28](https://ref.ly/Exod29:19-Exod29:28)). The same patterns established here are expanded to the regular offerings of the people (see [29:38–46](https://ref.ly/Exod29:38-Exod29:46); [Lev 1–5](https://ref.ly/Lev1:1-Lev5:19)).

The Sabbath was understood to be the unique sign of the covenant ([31:13](https://ref.ly/Exod31:13), [16](https://ref.ly/Exod31:16), [17](https://ref.ly/Exod31:17); see also [20:8–11](https://ref.ly/Exod20:8-Exod20:11); [Isa 58:13–14](https://ref.ly/Isa58:13-Isa58:14); [Jer 17:21–27](https://ref.ly/Jer17:21-Jer17:27); [Neh 13:15–22](https://ref.ly/Neh13:15-Neh13:22)). The Sabbath is also said to figure significantly in the achievement of God’s underlying purpose of making his people holy*,* that is, set apart for his exclusive use and sharing his character ([Exod 31:13](https://ref.ly/Exod31:13), [14](https://ref.ly/Exod31:14), [15](https://ref.ly/Exod31:15)). Resting from their own work ([31:15](https://ref.ly/Exod31:15), [17](https://ref.ly/Exod31:17)) was also a practical way of demonstrating genuine dependence on God to meet their needs (see [20:8–11](https://ref.ly/Exod20:8-Exod20:11) and study notes).

## Exodus 31:14–15 (id: 11298)

It is absolutely important to learn that we can find life in God only by coming to him in his way. This is underlined by the death sentence for disobedience (see also [Num 15:32–36](https://ref.ly/Num15:32-Num15:36)). This is not to say that followers of God must always punish those who commit these offenses in this way; but here at the outset, it was vital to make this truth clear (see [Acts 5:1–11](https://ref.ly/Acts5:1-Acts5:11)). If the spiritual truth of this lesson has not been learned, mere ritual obedience will be of no value (see [Col 2:16–19](https://ref.ly/Col2:16-Col2:19)).

the shape of a calf: The idol might actually have been an image of a bull, like the images of the Egyptian god Amon\-Re that the people had known in Egypt. The bull represented power, domination, and fertility. The writer would then be using the term calf as a way of expressing contempt for the idol. Alternatively, Aaron might have made a calf, feeling that this sin was not as serious as if the idol were a full\-sized bull. • these are the gods who brought you out: The people attributed to the idol what they had just said that Moses had done ([32:1](https://ref.ly/Exod32:1)). Idolatry expresses the belief that the divine realm and the visible world are continuous with one another. This worldview sees it as possible to lay hold of divine power through ritual manipulation of the god by means of the idol. God had been insisting that the very opposite is true: God is *not* contained in or restrained by his creation, and his blessings cannot be procured by manipulating creation, either ritually or otherwise. The blessings of God are for those who surrender their own efforts to make themselves secure and come to him using the ways and means that he has decreed.

Your people whom you brought from the land of Egypt: God here attributes his own work to Moses, which suggests that he was testing Moses, giving him an opportunity to make the same mistake the people had made ([32:1](https://ref.ly/Exod32:1)). God was not “tempting” Moses in the sense of “seducing him to do evil” (see [Jas 1:13–14](https://ref.ly/Jas1:13-Jas1:14)), but he was putting Moses into a situation where he was faced with a clear choice that could take him in opposing directions (cp.

Although Moses commanded them to kill everyone ([32:27](https://ref.ly/Exod32:27)), the number 3,000 ([32:28](https://ref.ly/Exod32:28)) makes it clear that the word *everyone* had a restricted meaning. The reference to your own sons and brothers suggests that as Aaron had led in the idolatry, many of the Levites had led in the worship of the idol, and they were the ones that the rest of the Levites killed.

God promised to miraculously care for his people as he brought them into Canaan. This care depended on their obedience. In Hebrew, the word translated as *observe* also means "obey"([34:11](https://ref.ly/Exod34:11))*.* Unlike English, Hebrew does not separate hearing a command from obeying it.

Worship of idols was prohibited, particularly the idols of the peoples into whose lands the Israelites were going. Central to this restriction was the prohibition of treaties, or covenants, with these idol\-worshiping peoples. Not only would the making of a treaty involve recognizing those peoples’ gods (because ancient treaties would call upon the gods as witnesses; see study note on 20:1–23:33), but the very existence of the treaties would predispose the Israelites to accept the ways of their treaty partners ([34:12](https://ref.ly/Exod34:12), [15–16](https://ref.ly/Exod34:15-Exod34:16)).

Much of the report of the building of the Tabernacle reiterates what was said in [25:1–31:18](https://ref.ly/Exod25:1-Exod31:18). There is a change from the imperative mood to the indicative, and there are certain changes in the order. This repetition underlines the point that the work was done exactly as God had commanded (see [40:16](https://ref.ly/Exod40:16)). The people had tried to secure God’s presence in their own way with the gold calf, and the result was disaster. Now they were doing it in God’s way, resulting in blessing ([40:34–38](https://ref.ly/Exod40:34-Exod40:38)).

Unlike the creation of the gold calf, where Aaron demanded that one type of material (earrings) be given (see study note on 32:2–4), the people were again invited to bring a variety of gifts ([35:4–9](https://ref.ly/Exod35:4-Exod35:9)) as their hearts were stirred and their spirits were moved ([35:21](https://ref.ly/Exod35:21)). Perhaps because the variety of gifts meant that everyone could bring something and because the giving was voluntary, the people gave too much and had to be commanded to stop ([36:4–7](https://ref.ly/Exod36:4-Exod36:7)).

The report on setting up the Tabernacle begins with the Lord’s commands to do so ([40:1–15](https://ref.ly/Exod40:1-Exod40:15)) and continues with the report on how Moses obeyed those commands ([40:16–33](https://ref.ly/Exod40:16-Exod40:33)). • The repeated statement that Moses did everything just as the Lord had commanded him ([40:16](https://ref.ly/Exod40:16), [19](https://ref.ly/Exod40:19), [21](https://ref.ly/Exod40:21), [23](https://ref.ly/Exod40:23), [25](https://ref.ly/Exod40:25), [27](https://ref.ly/Exod40:27),[29](https://ref.ly/Exod40:29), [32](https://ref.ly/Exod40:32)) is in radical contrast to Aaron’s self\-serving statement in [32:22–24](https://ref.ly/Exod32:22-Exod32:24). God wishes to share his presence with us, but his holiness is such that this can occur only if we renounce our own efforts to secure his presence and gifts.

The climax of the Exodus occurred when the glory of the Lord filled the Tabernacle. God’s goal from the outset was not merely to deliver his people from their bondage, but to bring them into a relationship with himself. Their real need was to know God personally in their lives. Without that, the Promised Land would not be a land of promise. Now it would be, because the glory that had been on Mount Sinai was in Israel’s midst; it would not be left behind but would travel with them wherever they might go.
