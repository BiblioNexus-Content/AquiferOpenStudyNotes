## Luke 1:1 (id: 20425)

Many people have set out to write accounts: Luke was not the first to put the history of Jesus into written form. Most scholars believe that Luke used Mark’s Gospel and other written and oral sources in his writing. • fulfilled: This word can simply mean “accomplished,” but Luke is thinking of Jesus’ fulfillment of Old Testament promises ([4:21](https://ref.ly/Luke4:21); [24:44](https://ref.ly/Luke24:44)).

* **Associated Passages:** LUK 1:1

## Luke 1:1–4 (id: 20420)

Luke begins his Gospel with a formal preface in the style of the best Greek writers of his day. These four verses are some of the finest literary Greek in the New Testament.

* **Associated Passages:** LUK 1:1–LUK 1:4

## Luke 1:3 (id: 20435)

As a good historian, Luke carefully investigated everything in the history of Jesus from the beginning in order to present a reliable historical account. • an accurate account: Some versions translate this phrase “in consecutive order,” but it refers to an orderly or carefully written account, not to chronological sequence. • The name Theophilus means “loved by God” or “one who loves God”; it is probably a personal name, not a descriptive name. Different theories identify him as (1\) an influential unbeliever, (2\) a new convert needing instruction, (3\) the judge overseeing Paul’s trial (the book of Acts ends with Paul imprisoned in Rome, awaiting trial), or (4\) the patron who sponsored Luke’s writing project. The last possibility is the most likely, as it was common to dedicate a literary work to a financial patron and the Greek word translated most honorable indicates someone of high social status.

* **Associated Passages:** LUK 1:3

## Luke 1:5 (id: 20443)

Herod was king of Judea: See “Herod the Great” Profile. • a Jewish priest named Zechariah: The priests were descendants of Aaron, Moses’ brother ([Exod 28:1](https://ref.ly/Exod28:1)). • the priestly order of Abijah: See study note on Luke 1:8–9; see also [1 Chr 24:10](https://ref.ly/1Chr24:10). • Elizabeth was also from the priestly line of Aaron: It was considered especially pious for a priest to marry a woman from a priestly family.

## Luke 1:5–2.52 (id: 20439)

Luke’s first two chapters give an account of Jesus’ birth and introduce key themes that will appear later in Luke–Acts. The announcements and birth stories for Jesus and John the Baptist run side by side, showing their parallel roles in bringing God’s salvation. At each point, Jesus is shown to be greater. John is the forerunner announcing Jesus’ coming; Jesus is the Savior.

* **Associated Passages:** LUK 1:5

## Luke 1:7 (id: 20452)

Elizabeth was unable to conceive: Childbearing was viewed as the highest calling for a woman, and infertility brought social stigma and shame. God miraculously intervened in the lives of various Old Testament women so they could bear children ([Gen 18:10–12](https://ref.ly/Gen18:10-Gen18:12); [25:21](https://ref.ly/Gen25:21); [30:22–23](https://ref.ly/Gen30:22-Gen30:23); [Judg 13](https://ref.ly/Judg13:1-Judg13:25); [1 Sam 1:1–28](https://ref.ly/1Sam1:1-1Sam1:28)).

* **Associated Passages:** LUK 1:7

## Luke 1:8–9 (id: 20453)

his order was on duty that week . . . he was chosen by lot: It was common in Old Testament times to cast lots (similar to throwing dice) to determine God’s will ([1 Chr 26:13–16](https://ref.ly/1Chr26:13-1Chr26:16); [Neh 11:1](https://ref.ly/Neh11:1); [Prov 16:33](https://ref.ly/Prov16:33); [Jon 1:7](https://ref.ly/Jonah1:7)). There were twenty\-four orders of priests ([1 Chr 24:1–19](https://ref.ly/1Chr24:1-1Chr24:19)) that took turns in the Temple, and lots were cast to determine which priest would serve in the sanctuary. There were a large number of priests, so this privilege might come only once in a priest’s lifetime. The angel appeared at the most sacred moment of Zechariah’s life. • to enter the sanctuary of the Lord and burn incense:. Luke uses the word here translated sanctuary (Greek naos) for the Temple building, not the whole Temple grounds, which he calls hieron ([Luke 2:27](https://ref.ly/Luke2:27)). The Temple building included the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place (see [Heb 9:1–5](https://ref.ly/Heb9:1-Heb9:5)). The priests burned incense twice a day in the Holy Place.

* **Associated Passages:** LUK 1:8–LUK 1:9

## Luke 1:12–13 (id: 20421)

Zechariah was shaken and overwhelmed with fear: Fear and awe are common reactions when someone sees an angel or experiences the presence of God ([Judg 6:22–23](https://ref.ly/Judg6:22-Judg6:23); [13:22](https://ref.ly/Judg13:22); [Isa 6:5](https://ref.ly/Isa6:5)). The person is often reassured by a saying such as Don’t be afraid. • you are to name him John: John means “the Lord has shown favor.” This favor came to Elizabeth and Zechariah through their son and to the Israelite nation through the Messiah, whose coming John would announce.

* **Associated Passages:** LUK 1:12–LUK 1:13

## Luke 1:15 (id: 20422)

He must never touch wine or other alcoholic drinks: In the Old Testament, abstaining from alcohol was part of the Nazirite vow of special dedication to God (see [Num 6:1–21](https://ref.ly/Num6:1-Num6:21)). This vow was usually temporary (see [Acts 18:18](https://ref.ly/Acts18:18); [21:23](https://ref.ly/Acts21:23), [26](https://ref.ly/Acts21:26)); for some individuals such as Samson ([Judg 13:4–7](https://ref.ly/Judg13:4-Judg13:7)), Samuel (cp. [1 Sam 1:11](https://ref.ly/1Sam1:11)), and John the Baptist, it was a lifelong commitment. • filled with the Holy Spirit, even before his birth: See [Luke 1:41](https://ref.ly/Luke1:41), [44](https://ref.ly/Luke1:44).

* **Associated Passages:** LUK 1:15

## Luke 1:17 (id: 20423)

He will be a man with the spirit and power of Elijah: The prophet Malachi predicted that God would send Elijah before the time of God’s salvation (see [Mal 3:1](https://ref.ly/Mal3:1); [4:5–6](https://ref.ly/Mal4:5-Mal4:6)). John fulfilled this role by preparing the way for the Lord’s coming.

* **Associated Passages:** LUK 1:17

## Luke 1:19 (id: 20424)

I am Gabriel! Two angels are named in Scripture: Gabriel ([Dan 8:16](https://ref.ly/Dan8:16); [9:21](https://ref.ly/Dan9:21)) and Michael ([Dan 10:13](https://ref.ly/Dan10:13); [12:1](https://ref.ly/Dan12:1); [Jude 1:9](https://ref.ly/Jude1:9); [Rev 12:7](https://ref.ly/Rev12:7)).

* **Associated Passages:** LUK 1:19

## Luke 1:20 (id: 20426)

now . . . you will be silent and unable to speak: This discipline for Zechariah’s lack of faith was also a sign that confirmed the prophecy. The Greek word translated *silent* in [1:22](https://ref.ly/Luke1:22) can also mean “deaf” ([7:22](https://ref.ly/Luke7:22); cp. [1:62](https://ref.ly/Luke1:62)). • Zechariah is contrasted with Mary, who responded with faith ([1:38](https://ref.ly/Luke1:38)).

* **Associated Passages:** LUK 1:20

## Luke 1:24 (id: 20427)

went into seclusion for five months: The reason for this seclusion is unknown and does not seem related to any Old Testament custom or command. Perhaps it was a spiritual retreat to honor God for answered prayer.

* **Associated Passages:** LUK 1:24

## Luke 1:26 (id: 20428)

Nazareth, a village in Galilee*,* was an insignificant, disreputable little village southwest of the Sea of Galilee (see [John 1:46](https://ref.ly/John1:46)).

* **Associated Passages:** LUK 1:26

## Luke 1:27 (id: 20429)

engaged to be married: In Jewish culture, marriages were arranged, and engagement was a formal legal contract between two families. Girls were normally married by their mid\-teens. • Joseph, a descendant of King David: See [Matt 1:1–16](https://ref.ly/Matt1:1-Matt1:16). Joseph’s ancestry is significant because the Messiah was to be a descendant of King David ([2 Sam 7:11–16](https://ref.ly/2Sam7:11-2Sam7:16); [Isa 9:7](https://ref.ly/Isa9:7)).

* **Associated Passages:** LUK 1:27

you will name him Jesus: Jesus means “the Lord saves.”

* **Associated Passages:** LUK 1:31

## Luke 1:32–33 (id: 20431)

These verses echo God’s covenant with David ([2 Sam 7:11–16](https://ref.ly/2Sam7:11-2Sam7:16)), the foundational promise of the coming Messiah (see also [Isa 9:6–7](https://ref.ly/Isa9:6-Isa9:7); [11:1–5](https://ref.ly/Isa11:1-Isa11:5); [Jer 23:5–6](https://ref.ly/Jer23:5-Jer23:6); [33:15–16](https://ref.ly/Jer33:15-Jer33:16); [Ezek 37:24–25](https://ref.ly/Ezek37:24-Ezek37:25)).

* **Associated Passages:** LUK 1:36

## Luke 1:39 (id: 20434)

The hill country of Judea was 80–100 miles away from Nazareth, at least a four\-day journey.

* **Associated Passages:** LUK 1:39

## Luke 1:41 (id: 20436)

Elizabeth’s child leaped within her: See [1:15](https://ref.ly/Luke1:15). John was already announcing the Messiah’s coming. • Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit: In the Old Testament, being filled with the Spirit was often associated with a prophetic gift. The Spirit of prophecy was again appearing in Israel (see [1:67](https://ref.ly/Luke1:67); [2:25](https://ref.ly/Luke2:25), [27](https://ref.ly/Luke2:27)).

* **Associated Passages:** LUK 1:41

## Luke 1:46–55 (id: 20437)

Mary’s song is the first of three songs of praise in the birth narrative. It is called the *Magnificat* (“magnifies”), from the first word in the Latin translation. The song has many parallels to Hannah’s prayer in [1 Sam 2:1–10](https://ref.ly/1Sam2:1-1Sam2:10). The fact that God cares for the oppressed and reverses their fortunes is a common theme throughout Luke’s Gospel. The coming of God’s Kingdom brings salvation to rejected and outcast people.

* **Associated Passages:** LUK 1:46–LUK 1:55

## Luke 1:48 (id: 20438)

all generations will call me blessed: In Middle Eastern culture, honor and shame were extremely important, and one’s legacy to future generations was highly cherished.

* **Associated Passages:** LUK 1:51

## Luke 1:54–55 (id: 20441)

Gabriel’s words in [1:32–33](https://ref.ly/Luke1:32-Luke1:33) recalled God’s covenant with David; here Mary alluded to God’s covenant with Abraham ([Gen 12:1–3](https://ref.ly/Gen12:1-Gen12:3); [17:3–8](https://ref.ly/Gen17:3-Gen17:8)). • The coming of Jesus brought glory to Israel and salvation to the Gentiles (see [Luke 2:32](https://ref.ly/Luke2:32)).

## Luke 1:59 (id: 20442)

God commanded every Israelite male to be circumcised when eight days old ([Gen 17:9–14](https://ref.ly/Gen17:9-Gen17:14); [Lev 12:3](https://ref.ly/Lev12:3)). Circumcision signified the child’s incorporation into the covenant community of Israel. • They wanted to name him Zechariah: It was common to name a child after a relative. The family and friends were surprised because John was not the name of any of his relatives.

* **Associated Passages:** LUK 1:59

## Luke 1:62–63 (id: 20444)

they used gestures: Zechariah was mute and deaf (see study note on 1:20). Zechariah’s obedience in naming the child John confirmed his faith, and his voice and hearing were restored.

* **Associated Passages:** LUK 1:66

## Luke 1:67–79 (id: 20446)

This second hymn of the birth narrative is called the *Benedictus* (“Blessed” or “Praise”), from the first word of the Latin translation. The hymn expects God’s Messiah to deliver the Israelites from their enemies. Salvation entails physical deliverance and forgiveness of sins ([1:77](https://ref.ly/Luke1:77)).

* **Associated Passages:** LUK 1:67–LUK 1:79

## Luke 1:68 (id: 20447)

he has visited and redeemed his people: This recalls the exodus from Egypt, when God rescued his people from Pharaoh ([Exod 3:7–10](https://ref.ly/Exod3:7-Exod3:10), [17–20](https://ref.ly/Exod3:17-Exod3:20)).

* **Associated Passages:** LUK 1:68

## Luke 1:69 (id: 20448)

He has sent us a mighty Savior (literally *has raised up a horn of salvation for us*): A “horn of salvation” was the horn of a powerful animal such as a ram or an ox. To “raise up a horn” implies strength and power (see also [Pss 89:24](https://ref.ly/Ps89:24); [132:17](https://ref.ly/Ps132:17)). • from the royal line of his servant David: See study note on Luke 1:32–33.

And you, my little son: Zechariah turned from speaking about the coming Messiah to address his newborn son, John, who would prepare the Messiah’s way. • called the prophet of the Most High: John was the last and greatest in the line of Old Testament prophets (see [7:28](https://ref.ly/Luke7:28)). • prepare the way for the Lord: See [Isa 40:3](https://ref.ly/Isa40:3).

* **Associated Passages:** LUK 1:76–LUK 1:77

## Luke 2:1 (id: 20720)

Caesar Augustus*,* whose given name was Octavian, ruled the Roman Empire from 27 BC to AD 14\. Prior to his time, Rome was a republic ruled by a senate.

* **Associated Passages:** LUK 2:1

## Luke 2:1–7 (id: 20714)

## Luke 2:2 (id: 20729)

Quirinius was governor of Syria: Quirinius held this post AD 6–9\. In 6–4 BC, Quirinius also had authority over Judea, possibly through some kind of joint rule. He may have begun the census. Historical accounts mention three other censuses at that time (in Syria, Gaul, and Spain), and there was no reason not to have one in Judea, though it is not mentioned in secular records. Jesus was born around 6–4 BC, before Herod the Great died in 4 BC (see [Matt 2:1–19](https://ref.ly/Matt2:1-Matt2:19)).

* **Associated Passages:** LUK 2:2

## Luke 2:3–4 (id: 20730)

Since Joseph was a descendant of King David*,* he returned to David’s hometown of Bethlehem ([1 Sam 17:12](https://ref.ly/1Sam17:12), [58](https://ref.ly/1Sam17:58); [20:6](https://ref.ly/1Sam20:6)), a tiny village in Judea five miles south of Jerusalem, where [Mic 5:2](https://ref.ly/Mic5:2) predicted that the Messiah would be born.

wrapped him snugly in strips of cloth: This common practice showed motherly love and care (see [Ezek 16:4](https://ref.ly/Ezek16:4)). • A manger was a feeding trough for animals. • no lodging available for them: This is a more accurate translation than the traditional “no room in the inn.” The word translated *lodging* does not mean an inn (there were no inns in tiny Bethlehem), but either a guest room in a private house or a public shelter for travelers. Since there was no normal lodging, Joseph and Mary moved to an area reserved for animals.

* **Associated Passages:** LUK 2:7

## Luke 2:8 (id: 20749)

Shepherds were sometimes portrayed in Judaism as drifters and dishonest troublemakers. This stereotype was not universal, however; in the Old Testament, shepherds are usually viewed positively (e.g., [Ps 23:1](https://ref.ly/Ps23:1)). Jesus came to common people such as these poor and humble peasants. • staying in the fields: This suggests warmer months of the year, perhaps March through November, though some shepherds stayed out year\-round. The actual month of Jesus’ birth is unknown. • They were guarding their flocks against thieves and wild animals.

* **Associated Passages:** LUK 2:8

## Luke 2:9–10 (id: 20750)

terrified: As with Zechariah and Mary, the angelic presence was glorious and frightening. The angel told the shepherds, “Don’t be afraid” (cp. [1:11–13](https://ref.ly/Luke1:11-Luke1:13), [28–30](https://ref.ly/Luke1:28-Luke1:30)). • I bring you good news: This verb (Greek euangelizō*,* “I evangelize”) is from the same root as the word for “Good News” (Greek euangelion*,* sometimes translated *gospel;* e.g., [Gal 2:5](https://ref.ly/Gal2:5), [7](https://ref.ly/Gal2:7), [14](https://ref.ly/Gal2:14)). Isaiah’s prophecies describe God’s salvation as good news (see, e.g., [Isa 52:7](https://ref.ly/Isa52:7); [61:1](https://ref.ly/Isa61:1)). • to all people (literally *to all the people*): In Luke’s writings, “the people” (grammatical singular) always refers to the people of Israel. The shepherds were being told that Israel’s salvation had arrived. It would ultimately go to all nations.

* **Associated Passages:** LUK 2:9–LUK 2:10

## Luke 2:11 (id: 20715)

The word "Messiah" means "Anointed One." It comes from the Hebrew word *mashiakh* and is translated into Greek as *Christos*. The Messiah refers to the promised savior who would come from King David's family line (see study note on 1:32–33). As the apostles started preaching the good news about Jesus to the non\-Jewish world, Christians started using *Christos* more as a name than a title.

## Luke 2:13 (id: 20717)

The armies of heaven reveal God’s sovereign power and authority ([2 Kgs 6:17](https://ref.ly/2Kgs6:17); [Ps 148:2](https://ref.ly/Ps148:2)). “Lord of Heaven’s Armies” is a common Old Testament name for God (e.g., [1 Sam 1:11](https://ref.ly/1Sam1:11); [17:45](https://ref.ly/1Sam17:45); [2 Sam 7:8](https://ref.ly/2Sam7:8); [Isa 5:16](https://ref.ly/Isa5:16); [Rom 9:29](https://ref.ly/Rom9:29); [Jas 5:4](https://ref.ly/Jas5:4)).

## Luke 2:14 (id: 20718)

Glory to God in highest heaven: This short hymn is known as the *Gloria in excelsis Deo* from the first line of the Latin translation. The Messiah’s coming brings glory to God in the heavens and peace to humans on earth. • peace on earth to those with whom God is pleased: Peace indicates total well\-being, not just the absence of hostility. The traditional translation, “on earth peace, good will toward men” (KJV), is based on the reading of some late manuscripts. The NLT text follows more reliable early manuscripts. Peace comes to the recipients of God’s grace.

## Luke 2:19 (id: 20719)

Mary kept all these things in her heart: Perhaps Mary reflected on the significance of these events and wondered about Jesus’ destiny. It is also possible that Luke says this because Mary was his source of information on these events.

Annas and Caiaphas were the high priests: Annas was high priest AD 6–15 and was deposed by the Romans; his son\-in\-law Caiaphas was the current high priest (AD 18–36\). Luke lists both names because Annas still wielded significant power behind the scenes (see [John 18:13–14](https://ref.ly/John18:13-John18:14), [24](https://ref.ly/John18:24); [Acts 4:6](https://ref.ly/Acts4:6)). • a message from God came to John: John’s calling as a prophet was similar to that of the Old Testament prophets (see, e.g., [Isa 6](https://ref.ly/Isa6:1-Isa6:13); [Jer 1](https://ref.ly/Jer1:1-Jer1:19)).

The quotation is from [Isa 40:3–5](https://ref.ly/Isa40:3-Isa40:5) (Greek version); it speaks of God’s delivering the Jews from exile in Babylon. After the Jews had returned from exile ([Ezra 1–2](https://ref.ly/Ezra1:1-Ezra2:70)), the passage became associated with God’s end\-time salvation. John shouted in the wilderness to prepare God’s people for the Lord’s coming. God’s salvation is portrayed as a new exodus, bringing deliverance like the first exodus from Egypt. • Clear the road for him! . . . the rough places made smooth: The image reflects the Middle Eastern practice of preparing a road at the approach of a king, something like “rolling out the red carpet” (cp.

This genealogy reverses Matthew’s order ([Matt 1:1–17](https://ref.ly/Matt1:1-Matt1:17)).

Matthew’s genealogy descends from Abraham to Joseph, highlighting Jesus’ status as the rightful heir of David’s throne and the recipient of God’s promises to Abraham. The great differences between the two genealogies have led some to propose that Luke’s genealogy is that of Mary (see study note on 3:23), who was probably among Luke’s primary sources.

The people were pleased until Jesus reminded them that God reaches out to Gentiles as well as to Jews. The infuriated crowd then attempted to kill him.

The time of the Lord’s favor refers to the Year of Jubilee ([Lev 25:8–55](https://ref.ly/Lev25:8-Lev25:55)), when debts were erased, slaves were freed, and land was returned to its original owners. In [Isa 61](https://ref.ly/Isa61:1-Isa61:11), the Year of Jubilee is a metaphor for God’s salvation.

Have you come to destroy us? Though there was only one demon present, the plural *us* suggests that all of Satan’s forces were aware and fearful of Jesus’ coming. • I know who you are: A common ancient belief held that naming a spiritual power gave a person authority over it.

Luke probably used Judea in the general sense of “the land of the Jews,” since Jesus’ ministry was then in Galilee in the north (see [5:1](https://ref.ly/Luke5:1)), not south in Judea.

* **Associated Passages:** LUK 4:44

## Luke 5:1–11 (id: 20975)

This is the first call of disciples recorded in Luke; Matthew and Mark recount a (presumably earlier) call of the four fishermen brothers ([Matt 4:18–22](https://ref.ly/Matt4:18-Matt4:22); [Mark 1:16–20](https://ref.ly/Mark1:16-Mark1:20)).

## Luke 5:4 (id: 20997)

let down your nets to catch some fish: Peter was naturally skeptical when a rabbi told fishermen how to catch fish. Jesus’ command was odd for three reasons: (1\) When the sun came up, the fish moved to the bottom of the lake (which is why they fished at night); (2\) they fished with a heavy dragnet hung over the side of the boat by two men (or between two boats) and could not go deep with it; (3\) they had just fished all night with no results, and the prospects were now much more unlikely.

an advanced case of leprosy: “Leprosy” does not refer specifically to the modern disease known as leprosy (Hansen’s disease), but to a variety of skin disorders. To avoid contagion, lepers were outcasts in the ancient world, required to live on the margins of society.

Jesus reached out and touched him: Most people feared catching the disease through physical contact, but Jesus showed compassion. Jesus was not contaminated by disease or evil, but brought healing and salvation. • Be healed: Literally *Be cleansed.* This act had spiritual and physical significance, since leprosy separated Israelites from social contact and religious practice.

Meals were rituals of social status in the ancient world, and eating with someone meant social acceptance of that person. The Pharisees refused to eat with tax collectors and other sinners, or to enter their homes, believing that this would defile them. They expected Jesus, as a rabbi, to do the same. Jesus shattered social norms by dining with sinners and allowing sinful people to touch him ([5:29](https://ref.ly/Luke5:29); [7:39](https://ref.ly/Luke7:39); [15:1](https://ref.ly/Luke15:1)).

John the Baptist’s disciples: Most rabbis had students who learned from them and served them (see also [Acts 19:1–7](https://ref.ly/Acts19:1-Acts19:7)). • fast and pray regularly: Many pious Jews fasted two days a week ([Luke 18:12](https://ref.ly/Luke18:12)). Fasting was associated with spiritual preparation ([Esth 4:16](https://ref.ly/Esth4:16)) and repentance ([2 Sam 12:22](https://ref.ly/2Sam12:22); [Joel 1:14](https://ref.ly/Joel1:14); [Jon 3:5](https://ref.ly/Jonah3:5)). Fasting is not a means of righteousness ([Isa 58:4–5](https://ref.ly/Isa58:4-Isa58:5); [Jer 14:12](https://ref.ly/Jer14:12)) but a spiritual discipline for cultivating intimacy with God. Fasting is often linked with prayer and spiritual retreat. • Why are your disciples always eating and drinking? The point was that they did not fast regularly.

Do wedding guests fast? Just as it would be inappropriate for anyone to fast at a wedding celebration, it was inappropriate for people to fast while the Messiah was with them.

## Luke 6:1–11 (id: 21000)

Jesus’ conflicts with the religious leaders continued with two controversies over the Sabbath.

While fleeing from Saul ([1 Sam 21](https://ref.ly/1Sam21:1-1Sam21:15)), David . . . and his companions took refuge at the sanctuary of Nob. The priest Ahimelech gave them the consecrated Bread of the Presence that only priests were lawfully allowed to eat ([Exod 25:30](https://ref.ly/Exod25:30); [Lev 24:9](https://ref.ly/Lev24:9)). Jesus’ point was that a technical violation of the law is superseded by the higher law of meeting human needs. There might also be a comparison between David and Jesus as God’s chosen and anointed kings of Israel.

* **Associated Passages:** LUK 6:3

## Luke 6:5 (id: 21024)

Lord, even over the Sabbath: The saying is a play on words with a double meaning. First, *son of man* often means “human being,” so Jesus affirmed that the Sabbath was made to serve human beings. *Son of Man* was also a title for the Messiah (see [Dan 7:13–14](https://ref.ly/Dan7:13-Dan7:14)). Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath because he created it.

The deformed hand was clearly not an emergency.

Promises of blessing for the poor and oppressed are balanced in Luke with predictions of sorrow for the rich and powerful. Those who trust in themselves will be humbled, while those who depend on God will be blessed. The Old Testament prophets often pronounced woes against nations and rulers who oppressed God’s people and rejected his sovereignty (e.g., [Isa 3:11](https://ref.ly/Isa3:11); [5:8](https://ref.ly/Isa5:8); [Jer 50:27](https://ref.ly/Jer50:27); [Zech 11:17](https://ref.ly/Zech11:17)).

## Luke 6:27 (id: 21013)

love your enemies! People were commonly taught in the ancient world to love their family and friends and hate their enemies. Jesus announced a radical new ethic of loving even one’s enemies and overcoming evil through self\-sacrificial love for others, not through violence and hatred (cp. [Rom 12:14–21](https://ref.ly/Rom12:14-Rom12:21)).

* **Associated Passages:** LUK 6:27

## Luke 6:30 (id: 21015)

when things are taken away from you, don’t try to get them back: Jesus’ point is that the cycle of hatred and violence that characterizes human nature can only be broken by responding with good, not evil ([Rom 12:17](https://ref.ly/Rom12:17)). We win the world through self\-sacrificial love. Jesus was not promoting injustice, as though believers should let criminals take advantage of the weak. God established governments to punish evildoers ([Rom 13:1–5](https://ref.ly/Rom13:1-Rom13:5)).

## Luke 6:31 (id: 21016)

Do to others as you would like them to do to you: While the Golden Rule appears in some form in various religious and philosophical traditions, only in Jesus’ teaching is love for all people, including enemies, the fundamental ethic that governs all behavior.

## Luke 6:34–36 (id: 21017)

The law of Moses prohibited charging interest on loans to other Israelites in order to prevent exploitation of the poor ([Exod 22:25](https://ref.ly/Exod22:25); [Lev 25:35–37](https://ref.ly/Lev25:35-Lev25:37); [Deut 23:20](https://ref.ly/Deut23:20)). Jesus further instructed his followers to lend . . . without expecting to be repaid. By doing good even to those who do evil, we act as children of the Most High and imitate our Father in heaven, who is kind to all people (cp. [Rom 5:8](https://ref.ly/Rom5:8)).

* **Associated Passages:** LUK 6:34–LUK 6:36

## Luke 6:37–42 (id: 21018)

Do not judge others: Jesus condemned hypocritical judgment that denigrated another person. Those who condemn others will be judged by that same standard. God requires his people to love others by warning them of the dangers of sin ([Gal 6:1](https://ref.ly/Gal6:1); [Heb 3:13](https://ref.ly/Heb3:13)). Exhortation is an act of love; judgment is an act of pride.

Jesus did not come to overthrow Roman rule over Judea (so he omits “captives . . . will be freed” from his quotation of [Isa 61:1](https://ref.ly/Isa61:1)); he came for the greater purpose of reversing the effects of sin and death.

## Luke 7:31–35 (id: 21040)

To what can I compare the people of this generation? Jesus compares Israel to fickle children in the marketplace who play games of make\-believe. They called John the Baptist to dance (a wedding game), but the solemn prophet refused, calling them instead to mourning and repentance for their sins. Then they called on Jesus to mourn (a funeral game), but he was the bridegroom who announced the joyful celebration banquet of the Kingdom of God, so it would not have been fitting for him to mourn (cp. [Mark 2:19–20](https://ref.ly/Mark2:19-Mark2:20)).

the secrets of the Kingdom of God: What was hidden in the past about God’s reign was now revealed through Jesus’ words and actions. • When they look . . . they won’t understand: This quote is from [Isa 6:9](https://ref.ly/Isa6:9) (Greek version), a passage repeatedly used in the New Testament to explain Israel’s rejection of the gospel (see also [Matt 13:14–15](https://ref.ly/Matt13:14-Matt13:15); [Mark 4:12](https://ref.ly/Mark4:12); [John 12:40](https://ref.ly/John12:40); [Acts 28:26–27](https://ref.ly/Acts28:26-Acts28:27)). In its original context, the passage refers to God’s certain judgment of Israel at the hands of the Assyrians.

Despite opposition from human beings and from the spiritual forces of Satan, God works through the actions of human beings to accomplish his purposes. Though wicked men plotted against Jesus and put him to death, God accomplished salvation by raising Jesus from the dead ([Luke 24:7](https://ref.ly/Luke24:7), [26–27](https://ref.ly/Luke24:26-Luke24:27), [44–47](https://ref.ly/Luke24:44-Luke24:47); [Acts 2:23–24](https://ref.ly/Acts2:23-Acts2:24); [3:18](https://ref.ly/Acts3:18); [4:28](https://ref.ly/Acts4:28)). • leading priests: Though Israel had only one high priest, the upper\-class priests were the aristocracy; they served on the Sanhedrin and held positions of power in Jerusalem.

The Lord now chose seventy\-two: The mission of the Twelve ([9:1–6](https://ref.ly/Luke9:1-Luke9:6)) represented Jesus’ ministry to Israel; this mission represented his outreach to the Gentiles. The number 72 represents the nations of the world. [Genesis 10](https://ref.ly/Gen10:1-Gen10:32) lists 70 nations in the Hebrew text, but the Septuagint—the Greek Old Testament—lists 72\.

a priest: Priests were descendants of Aaron from the tribe of Levi ([Exod 28:1–3](https://ref.ly/Exod28:1-Exod28:3)). They served in the Temple and offered sacrifices to God. • passed him by: A priest or a Levite became unclean and unable to serve in the Temple if he touched a dead body.

A Temple assistant (literally *a Levite*): Levites were members of the tribe of Levi.

## Luke 10:33 (id: 20475)

a despised Samaritan: This reversal in the story must have left the listeners aghast. Jews and Samaritans hated each other (see [9:52–53](https://ref.ly/Luke9:52-Luke9:53); [17:16](https://ref.ly/Luke17:16); [John 4:4–42](https://ref.ly/John4:4-John4:42)). After the Assyrians conquered the northern kingdom of Israel, Assyrian colonists intermarried with Israelites left in Samaria; these inhabitants became known as Samaritans. After the Judeans returned from Babylon, conflict arose between the Jews and the Samaritans ([Ezra 4:1–24](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:1-Ezra4:24)), who built a rival temple on Mount Gerizim and used their own version of the Pentateuch (Genesis—Deuteronomy) as their Scripture. Hatred between the two increased dramatically when the Jewish king John Hyrcanus attacked the Samaritans and destroyed the temple on Mount Gerizim (about 128 BC). In this context of mutual animosity, no first\-century Jew would expect a despised Samaritan to help a wounded Jew. But in God’s Kingdom, a despised foreigner becomes a helping neighbor!

And don’t let us yield to temptation: This is a difficult phrase in the Greek.

he will cut the servant in pieces: Such brutal judgment was common in the ancient world. It is uncertain whether Jesus was talking about temporal punishment or eternal damnation. • and banish him with the unfaithful: This could either mean “treat him as an unbeliever” (a temporal judgment) or “send him to hell” (an eternal judgment), depending on whether Jesus was referring to discipline for a believer or condemnation of an unbeliever. The point is that an unfaithful servant faces stringent judgment.

This example fit the context by showing that Jesus’ authoritative words interpreted and fulfilled the Old Testament law. • a man who divorces his wife and marries someone else commits adultery: The Old Testament allowed for divorce but did not sanction it ([Deut 24:1–4](https://ref.ly/Deut24:1-Deut24:4)), and the rabbis of Jesus’ day debated what constituted legitimate grounds. The school of Shammai allowed a man to divorce his wife only because of unfaithfulness, while the school of Hillel allowed divorce for almost any reason. Against such a casual attitude, Jesus said that breaking the marriage vow by divorce and marrying someone else was equivalent to adultery. Elsewhere ([Matt 5:32](https://ref.ly/Matt5:32); [19:9](https://ref.ly/Matt19:9)), Jesus provided a clear exception for cases of unfaithfulness.

## Luke 17:20–21 (id: 20644)

When will the Kingdom of God come? The common understanding among Jews was that the Messiah would establish God’s Kingdom in Jerusalem; he would defeat Israel’s enemies and bring in a period of peace, prosperity, justice, and righteousness (see [3:15](https://ref.ly/Luke3:15); cp. [Acts 1:6](https://ref.ly/Acts1:6)). The Pharisees were apparently challenging Jesus’ claim to be the Messiah because he was not defeating the Romans or establishing his Kingdom physically on earth. Jesus did not reject this future manifestation of the Kingdom (see [Luke 21:27](https://ref.ly/Luke21:27); [Matt 24:30–31](https://ref.ly/Matt24:30-Matt24:31)) but pointed out that the Kingdom of God was being revealed to them through his ministry, though they were missing it. • The Kingdom of God can’t be detected by visible signs: Jewish apocalyptic literature of Jesus’ day looked for visible signs in the heavens to signal the coming of the Messiah’s kingdom. Jesus elsewhere affirmed that such signs would appear (see [Luke 17:24](https://ref.ly/Luke17:24); [21:25](https://ref.ly/Luke21:25); [Acts 2:19–20](https://ref.ly/Acts2:19-Acts2:20)), but the Pharisees were missing the manifestation of the Kingdom in Jesus’ immediate ministry (cp. [Luke 7:22](https://ref.ly/Luke7:22)). • the Kingdom of God is already among you (or *is within you,* or *is in your grasp*): The Kingdom of God was already being revealed through Jesus’ words and actions. It is unlikely that Jesus would say, “The Kingdom of God is within you,” to those who were rejecting his message.

## Luke 17:23–24 (id: 20647)

People will tell you, ‘Look, there is the Son of Man’: False Messiahs have arisen throughout history, but expectations for the Messiah were particularly high in the first century, as a variety of figures claimed to be God’s agents of deliverance (see [Acts 5:36–37](https://ref.ly/Acts5:36-Acts5:37); [21:38](https://ref.ly/Acts21:38)).

Mary Magdalene and Joanna are mentioned in [8:2–3](https://ref.ly/Luke8:2-Luke8:3). Mary the mother of James is not the mother of James, the son of Zebedee (see [Matt 27:56](https://ref.ly/Matt27:56)), but might be the mother of James, the son of Alphaeus ([Luke 6:15](https://ref.ly/Luke6:15)).

two of Jesus’ followers: Jesus had many disciples in addition to the Twelve (see [10:1](https://ref.ly/Luke10:1), [17](https://ref.ly/Luke10:17)). Nothing else is known of Cleopas ([24:18](https://ref.ly/Luke24:18)) or the other disciple (who may have been his wife). They were probably returning from celebrating the Passover in Jerusalem.

## Luke 24:13–34 (id: 20896)

This account is Luke’s unique contribution to the resurrection narratives. Jesus corrected these disciples’ misunderstanding by showing from Scripture that it was necessary for the Messiah to suffer. He then opened their eyes to the truth of his resurrection.

## Luke 24:16 (id: 20898)

God kept them from recognizing him: The Greek uses a passive construction (*they were kept from recognizing him*) known as a “divine passive,” with God as the implied subject. God intentionally blinded their eyes until the moment of revelation, when Jesus broke bread with them ([24:30–31](https://ref.ly/Luke24:30-Luke24:31); cp. [2 Kgs 6:17](https://ref.ly/2Kgs6:17)).

## Luke 24:25–26 (id: 20904)

the prophets wrote . . . that the Messiah would have to suffer: The crucifixion did not negate Jesus’ identity as the Messiah but confirmed it, because the death of the Messiah was predicted in Scripture. Jesus rebuked the two for not recognizing from Scripture that the Messiah had to suffer (see [Isa 50:4–9](https://ref.ly/Isa50:4-Isa50:9); [52:13–53:12](https://ref.ly/Isa52:13-Isa53:12); [Pss 2](https://ref.ly/Ps2:1-Ps2:12), [16](https://ref.ly/Ps16:1-Ps16:11), [22](https://ref.ly/Ps22:1-Ps22:31), [118](https://ref.ly/Ps118:1-Ps118:29); cp.

Luke also narrates Jesus’ ascension in [Acts 1:1–11](https://ref.ly/Acts1:1-Acts1:11). For Luke, Jesus’ ascension confirmed his vindication, exaltation, and enthronement at God’s right hand as Messiah and Lord ([Acts 2:24–36](https://ref.ly/Acts2:24-Acts2:36)). From his position of glory and authority in heaven, Jesus guides and directs his church.
