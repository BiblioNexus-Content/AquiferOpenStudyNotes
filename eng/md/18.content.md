## Job 1:1 (id: 18333)

* The phrase "There once was a man" can begin a parable (symbolic story with asocial meanings) or a historical account ([2 Samuel 12:1](https://ref.ly/2Sam12:1); [1 Samuel 25:2](https://ref.ly/1Sam25:2)).
* [Ezekiel 14:14](https://ref.ly/Ezek14:14), [20](https://ref.ly/Ezek14:20) and [James 5:11](https://ref.ly/Jas5:11) also mention Job.
* *Uz* is east of the Jordan River, either in Edom to the south or in Aram to the north ([Genesis 36:28](https://ref.ly/Gen36:28); [1 Chronicles 1:42](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:42); [Jeremiah 25:19–20](https://ref.ly/Jer25:19-Jer25:20); [Lamentations 4:21](https://ref.ly/Lam4:21); [Genesis 10:23](https://ref.ly/Gen10:23); [22:21](https://ref.ly/Gen22:21); [1 Chronicles 1:17](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:17), [42](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:42)). *Job* was not from Israel. He lived before the nation of Israel existed and outside its later territory.
* *Job* had no moral faults, he was a man of complete integrity ([Job 1:8](https://ref.ly/Job1:8); [2:3](https://ref.ly/Job2:3); see [Psalms 25:21](https://ref.ly/Ps25:21); [37:37](https://ref.ly/Ps37:37); [Proverbs 2:7](https://ref.ly/Prov2:7); [20:11](https://ref.ly/Prov20:11); [29:10](https://ref.ly/Prov29:10)). He did not claim to be perfect or without sin ([Job 6:24](https://ref.ly/Job6:24); [7:21](https://ref.ly/Job7:21); see also [Ecclesiastes 7:20](https://ref.ly/Eccl7:20); [Romans 3:23](https://ref.ly/Rom3:23); [1 John 1:8](https://ref.ly/1John1:8)). But he was righteous (in a right relationship with God) so his suffering was not because of guilt. Here, *fearing God* probably means he did not worship any Ancient Near Eastern gods (see [Psalms 111:10](https://ref.ly/Ps111:10); [Proverbs 1:7](https://ref.ly/Prov1:7); [9:10](https://ref.ly/Prov9:10); [2 Corinthians 7:1](https://ref.ly/2Cor7:1); [Job 9:8](https://ref.ly/Job9:8); [23:13](https://ref.ly/Job23:13); [31:26–28](https://ref.ly/Job31:26-Job31:28)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 1:1

## Job 1:1–2:13 (id: 18326)

God and Satan agree to test Job, which causes his troubles and confirms his integrity ([1:20–21](https://ref.ly/Job1:20-Job1:21); [2:10](https://ref.ly/Job2:10)). None of the book's characters ever learn of this council in heaven.

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 1:1–JOB 2:13

## Job 1:2–3 (id: 18334)

* God gave *Job* prosperity with many *sons*, *daughters*, cattle and other domestic animals, and *servants* (compare [Genesis 30:43](https://ref.ly/Gen30:43); [Deuteronomy 7:13](https://ref.ly/Deut7:13); [Psalm 107:38](https://ref.ly/Ps107:38)).
* Numbers like *seven* and *three* (and *7,000* and *3,000*) show the full extent of God's blessings for Job (see [Job 42:13](https://ref.ly/Job42:13); also see [Psalms 127:3–5](https://ref.ly/Ps127:3-Ps127:5); [128:3](https://ref.ly/Ps128:3)).
* *Job was the greatest man of all the people of the East*: The numbers describing Job’s wealth might not be exact, but they are realistic for a wealthy man of that time (compare Nabal’s wealth in [1 Samuel 25:2](https://ref.ly/1Sam25:2)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 1:2–JOB 1:3

## Job 1:5 (id: 18336)

* People often washed and changed clothes to *purify* themselves before making a sacrifice ([Genesis 35:2](https://ref.ly/Gen35:2); [Exodus 19:10](https://ref.ly/Exod19:10), [14](https://ref.ly/Exod19:14)).
* The usual time for sincere religious dedication was early morning (see [Genesis 22:3](https://ref.ly/Gen22:3); [Psalm 5:3](https://ref.ly/Ps5:3); [Mark 1:35](https://ref.ly/Mark1:35)).
* *cursed*: The Hebrew verb *barak* (usually meaning *blessed*) used here is a polite way to say "cursed" (compare [Job 1:11](https://ref.ly/Job1:11); [2:5](https://ref.ly/Job2:5), [9](https://ref.ly/Job2:9); [1 Kings 21:10](https://ref.ly/1Kgs21:10), [13](https://ref.ly/1Kgs21:13); [Psalm 10:3](https://ref.ly/Ps10:3)). Job worried that his children might have committed this serious crime ([Leviticus 24:10–16](https://ref.ly/Lev24:10-Lev24:16); [1 Kings 21:9–13](https://ref.ly/1Kgs21:9-1Kgs21:13); compare [Job 1:11](https://ref.ly/Job1:11); [2:5](https://ref.ly/Job2:5), [9](https://ref.ly/Job2:9)). Job knew that God regards wrong attitudes as sin ([Jeremiah 17:9–10](https://ref.ly/Jer17:9-Jer17:10); [Mark 7:21–23](https://ref.ly/Mark7:21-Mark7:23)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 1:5

## Job 1:6–7 (id: 18337)

* These *sons of God* are spiritual beings and members of the court of heaven. They are probably either holy angels or demons ([Genesis 6:2](https://ref.ly/Gen6:2), [4](https://ref.ly/Gen6:4)). They join God in his discussions, including during creation and in his rule over creation ([Genesis 1:26](https://ref.ly/Gen1:26); [Job 1:6](https://ref.ly/Job1:6); [Genesis 3:22](https://ref.ly/Gen3:22); [2:1](https://ref.ly/Gen2:1); [1 Kings 22:19–22](https://ref.ly/1Kgs22:19-1Kgs22:22); [Psalms 82:1](https://ref.ly/Ps82:1); [89:5](https://ref.ly/Ps89:5), [7–8](https://ref.ly/Ps89:7-Ps89:8); [Daniel 3:13](https://ref.ly/Dan3:13), [17](https://ref.ly/Dan3:17), [23](https://ref.ly/Dan3:23), [25](https://ref.ly/Dan3:25); [7:9–14](https://ref.ly/Dan7:9-Dan7:14)).
* It is uncertain in the account if *Satan* usually came with other court members of heaven to report or if he forced his way in as Job’s opponent.
* *"Where have you come from?"*: This question was God’s command for a report from one of his subjects (see [Genesis 3:9](https://ref.ly/Gen3:9)).
* *Satan* was not *roaming through* *the earth* to do God’s will (compare [1 Chronicles 21:1–14](https://ref.ly/1Chr21:1-1Chr21:14); [2 Kings 19:35](https://ref.ly/2Kgs19:35) is equivalent to [Isaiah 37:36](https://ref.ly/Isa37:36); [Ezekiel 1:5–9](https://ref.ly/Ezek1:5-Ezek1:9)). Instead, he opposes God’s plans ([2 Timothy 2:26](https://ref.ly/2Tim2:26); [1 Peter 5:8](https://ref.ly/1Pet5:8)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 1:6–JOB 1:7

## Job 1:8 (id: 18338)

*My servant*: 

People used this title for:

1. The patriarchs ("first fathers") of Israel ([Genesis 26:24](https://ref.ly/Gen26:24); [Exodus 32:13](https://ref.ly/Exod32:13)).
2. The prophets ([2 Kings 17:13](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:13); [Jeremiah 7:25](https://ref.ly/Jer7:25); [Zechariah 1:6](https://ref.ly/Zech1:6)).
3. King David (for example, [2 Samuel 7:1–29](https://ref.ly/2Sam7:1-2Sam7:29); [Psalms 18:1](https://ref.ly/Ps18:1); [36:1](https://ref.ly/Ps36:1)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 1:8

## Job 1:9–11 (id: 18339)

*Job* has a good reason (Hebrew *khinnam*; see study note on 2:3) to *fear God*. The wisdom tradition connects being religious with prosperity. Satan suggested that Job's dedication to God depended on his wealth.

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 1:9–JOB 1:11
* **Associated Articles:** Job 2:3 (ID: `18443@TyndaleStudyNotes`)

## Job 1:10 (id: 18327)

*a hedge on every side*: See [1 Samuel 25:16](https://ref.ly/1Sam25:16); [Psalms 5:12](https://ref.ly/Ps5:12); [34:7](https://ref.ly/Ps34:7); [Zechariah 2:5](https://ref.ly/Zech2:5); compare [Isaiah 5:5](https://ref.ly/Isa5:5).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 1:10

## Job 1:11–12 (id: 18328)

* *Stretch out …* *and strike all he has …* *Everything he has is in your hands:* Satan was God's agent. The *hand* he used was both the Lord's and Satan's. They acted against everything Job owned and later against Job himself ([2:5–6](https://ref.ly/Job2:5-Job2:6)).
* Job later cursed the day of his birth, but he did not curse God ([3:1](https://ref.ly/Job3:1), [8](https://ref.ly/Job3:8); [31:30](https://ref.ly/Job31:30)). This was even true when his upset wife urged him to do so ([2:9](https://ref.ly/Job2:9)).
* God allowed Satan to test Job to show that Satan's negative view of Job was wrong ([1 Corinthians 10:11](https://ref.ly/1Cor10:11); see [James 1:13](https://ref.ly/Jas1:13); compare [Luke 22:31–32](https://ref.ly/Luke22:31-Luke22:32); [John 19:11](https://ref.ly/John19:11)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 1:11–JOB 1:12

## Job 1:13–19 (id: 18329)

* These attacks took away the blessings listed in [1:2–3](https://ref.ly/Job1:2-Job1:3). Job was left with four messengers who came to report terrible news and a wife who gave poor advice.
* The phrase "*While he was still speaking*" emphasizes the repeated nature of the attacks (see [Jeremiah 51:31](https://ref.ly/Jer51:31)). The phrase "*I alone have escaped to tell you*" emphasizes the complete destruction of Job’s resources.

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 1:13–JOB 1:19

## Job 1:15 (id: 18330)

*The Sabeans* were tribes who raided from the desert (compare [Judges 6:3](https://ref.ly/Judg6:3)). By the 700s BC, the southern *Sabeans* became a powerful nation. They traded in gold, precious stones, sweet smelling liquids, and slaves (see [Psalm 72:10](https://ref.ly/Ps72:10); [Isaiah 43:3](https://ref.ly/Isa43:3); [45:14](https://ref.ly/Isa45:14); [60:6](https://ref.ly/Isa60:6); [Jeremiah 6:20](https://ref.ly/Jer6:20)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 1:15

## Job 1:16 (id: 18331)

*The fire of God … from heaven*: This might have been lightning, fire in the desert, or the activity of a volcano ([20:26](https://ref.ly/Job20:26); [Leviticus 10:2](https://ref.ly/Lev10:2); [1 Kings 18:38](https://ref.ly/1Kgs18:38); [2 Kings 1:10–14](https://ref.ly/2Kgs1:10-2Kgs1:14); [Numbers 11:1–3](https://ref.ly/Num11:1-Num11:3); [Genesis 19:24](https://ref.ly/Gen19:24)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 1:16

## Job 1:19 (id: 18332)

*a mighty wind …**struck the four corners of the house*: This suggests that Job and his children were farmers settled and living in houses, not people wandering about and living in tents (nomads).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 1:19

## Job 1:20 (id: 18335)

* *Job stood up, tore his robe, and shaved his head*: These were common ceremonies in the Ancient Near East to show grief. People sometimes responded this way instead of harming themselves when shocked, in horror, or after hearing bad news ([2:12](https://ref.ly/Job2:12); [Genesis 37:29](https://ref.ly/Gen37:29), [34](https://ref.ly/Gen37:34); [Judges 11:35](https://ref.ly/Judg11:35); [Jeremiah 16:6](https://ref.ly/Jer16:6); [Ezekiel 7:18](https://ref.ly/Ezek7:18); [Amos 8:10](https://ref.ly/Amos8:10)).
* *He fell to the ground and worshiped*: Then in an unexpected move, *Job* did not give a desperate cry, but had hope ([1 Peter 5:6](https://ref.ly/1Pet5:6)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 1:20

## Job 2:1–3 (id: 18438)

This scene repeats exactly as it did in [1:6–8](https://ref.ly/Job1:6-Job1:8).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 2:1–JOB 2:3

## Job 2:3 (id: 18443)

The phrase *without cause* (Hebrew *khinnam*) is a play on words from Satan's question in [1:9](https://ref.ly/Job1:9).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 2:3

## Job 2:5 (id: 18444)

*strike his flesh and bones*: People once believed *bones* were the source of health.

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 2:5

## Job 2:6 (id: 18445)

*spare* (literally *guard* or *watch over*): Ironically, God made Satan responsible for guarding Job’s life (compare [10:13–14](https://ref.ly/Job10:13-Job10:14); [13:27](https://ref.ly/Job13:27); [33:11](https://ref.ly/Job33:11)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 2:6

## Job 2:7 (id: 18446)

This Hebrew term for *terrible* *boils* referred to any raised wounds that leak ([Exodus 9:10](https://ref.ly/Exod9:10); [Leviticus 13:18–20](https://ref.ly/Lev13:18-Lev13:20); [Deuteronomy 28:27](https://ref.ly/Deut28:27), [35](https://ref.ly/Deut28:35)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 2:7

## Job 2:8 (id: 18447)

* *Job* might have scraped his skin for relief. The ancient Greek Old Testament (Septuagint) says it was “to scrape away the pus.”
* *The ashes* might refer to a place where they placed lepers in isolation. But Job was probably showing his grief and how desperate he was ([30:19](https://ref.ly/Job30:19); [Genesis 18:27](https://ref.ly/Gen18:27); [2 Samuel 13:19](https://ref.ly/2Sam13:19); [Isaiah 58:5](https://ref.ly/Isa58:5); [Jonah 3:6](https://ref.ly/Jonah3:6)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 2:8

## Job 2:9 (id: 18448)

*Job's wife* first summarized Job's temptation by echoing God's words. Job was trying to "retain his *integrity*" ([2:3](https://ref.ly/Job2:3)). In her frustration and pain, she then advised Job to *curse God*. Without knowing it, she was asking Job to fulfill Satan's prediction ([1:11](https://ref.ly/Job1:11); [2:5](https://ref.ly/Job2:5)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 2:9

## Job 2:10 (id: 18439)

* *Job* accepted both good and bad things *from God*, showing his right relationship and faith in God (righteousness) (compare [1:21](https://ref.ly/Job1:21); [2 Samuel 12:16–20](https://ref.ly/2Sam12:16-2Sam12:20); [Luke 22:42](https://ref.ly/Luke22:42)).
* By saying nothing wrong*,* *Job* controlled his tongue ([Proverbs 13:3](https://ref.ly/Prov13:3); [21:23](https://ref.ly/Prov21:23); see [James 3:2](https://ref.ly/Jas3:2)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 2:10

## Job 2:11 (id: 18440)

* It might have taken several months for *Job’s three friends* to learn about his troubles (see study note on 6:14–27; see [7:3](https://ref.ly/Job7:3)).
* The text suggests that *Job’s three friends* were Edomites, a people known for their wisdom ([Jeremiah 49:7](https://ref.ly/Jer49:7); [Obadiah 1:8](https://ref.ly/Obad1:8)).
* *Eliphaz the Temanite* was probably a descendant of Esau’s grandson Teman ([Genesis 36:10–11](https://ref.ly/Gen36:10-Gen36:11), [15](https://ref.ly/Gen36:15)). His land was in Edom ([Ezekiel 25:13](https://ref.ly/Ezek25:13); [Amos 1:11–12](https://ref.ly/Amos1:11-Amos1:12)).
* The "Bil\-" part of the name "Bildad" would remind Hebrew readers of names like *Bilhan,* a descendant of Esau ([Genesis 36:27](https://ref.ly/Gen36:27); [1 Chronicles 1:42](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:42)). The "*\-*dad"part of the name would remind readers of names like *Bedad,* father of the Edomite king *Hadad* ([Genesis 36:35](https://ref.ly/Gen36:35); [1 Chronicles 1:46](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:46)).
* *Shuhite*: No place named "Shuah" is known, but Abraham’s son "Shuah" was sent to “a land in the east” ([Genesis 25:1](https://ref.ly/Gen25:1), [6](https://ref.ly/Gen25:6); [1 Chronicles 1:32](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:32)).
* The ancient Greek Old Testament (Septuagint) lists *Zophar* instead of "Zepho" as one of Esau’s grandsons ([Genesis 36:11](https://ref.ly/Gen36:11), [15](https://ref.ly/Gen36:15); [1 Chronicles 1:36](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:36)). A *Naamathite* might live in a town named "Naamah." But no such place is known. Two Old Testament women are named "Naamah," but neither is likely an ancestor of *Zophar* ([Genesis 4:22](https://ref.ly/Gen4:22); [1 Kings 14:21](https://ref.ly/1Kgs14:21)).

* **Associated Articles:** Job 6:14-27 (ID: `18682@TyndaleStudyNotes`)

## Job 2:12 (id: 18441)

* *They could barely recognize Job*: This expression shows how much *Job* had suffered (compare [Isaiah 52:14](https://ref.ly/Isa52:14); [53:3](https://ref.ly/Isa53:3)).
* Job’s friends showed their grief and *began to weep aloud*, as if Job was dead.
* Throwing *dust* sometimes showed anger or hate (see [2 Samuel 16:13](https://ref.ly/2Sam16:13); [Acts 22:23](https://ref.ly/Acts22:23)). But here it showed grief (see [Joshua 7:6](https://ref.ly/Josh7:6); [1 Samuel 4:12](https://ref.ly/1Sam4:12); [Nehemiah 9:1](https://ref.ly/Neh9:1); [Lamentations 2:10](https://ref.ly/Lam2:10)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 2:12

## Job 2:13 (id: 18442)

* Job’s friends *sat on the ground* to share in Job’s suffering (see [2:8](https://ref.ly/Job2:8)).
* People usually showed grief for seven days and nights when an important person died or to acknowledge other bad news ([Genesis 50:10](https://ref.ly/Gen50:10); [1 Samuel 31:13](https://ref.ly/1Sam31:13); see also [Ezekiel 3:14–15](https://ref.ly/Ezek3:14-Ezek3:15)).

* Job spoke and risked words of sin ([1:21](https://ref.ly/Job1:21); [2:10](https://ref.ly/Job2:10)).
* Job *cursed the day of his birth* in great detail. However, his words sounded more like sad complaints. Job did not curse God as his creator, but he showed grief about the condition of his life.

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 3:1–JOB 3:10

## Job 3:1–26 (id: 18526)

Job's outbreak of emotion did not mean his integrity failed under pressure ([42:7–8](https://ref.ly/Job42:7-Job42:8); [James 5:11](https://ref.ly/Jas5:11)). The prophets Elijah and Jeremiah, both men of God, exaggerated with similar language ([1 Kings 19:4](https://ref.ly/1Kgs19:4); [Jeremiah 20:14–18](https://ref.ly/Jer20:14-Jer20:18)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 3:1–JOB 3:26

## Job 3:5 (id: 18533)

Job wished that the *darkness* of the place of the dead and the *gloom* of death had not allowed him to be born ([Exodus 10:22](https://ref.ly/Exod10:22); [Proverbs 4:19](https://ref.ly/Prov4:19); [Joel 2:2](https://ref.ly/Joel2:2); [Job 10:21–22](https://ref.ly/Job10:21-Job10:22); [38:17](https://ref.ly/Job38:17)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 3:5

## Job 3:8 (id: 18534)

The phrase *those who curse the day* refers to people paid to *curse*, like Balaam ([Numbers 22–24](https://ref.ly/Num22:1-Num24:25)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 3:8

## Job 3:9 (id: 18535)

Venus and Mercury, known as the *morning stars,* announce the arrival of *dawn* ([38:7](https://ref.ly/Job38:7)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 3:9

## Job 3:10 (id: 18527)

*shut the doors of the womb*: Closing or opening *the womb* can mean conception ([Genesis 16:2](https://ref.ly/Gen16:2); [20:18](https://ref.ly/Gen20:18); [29:31](https://ref.ly/Gen29:31); [30:22](https://ref.ly/Gen30:22); [1 Samuel 1:5–6](https://ref.ly/1Sam1:5-1Sam1:6)). But here it means birth (see also [Job 38:8](https://ref.ly/Job38:8)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 3:10

## Job 3:11–24 (id: 18528)

Job's language shifts from wishing he was never born to grief. He goes from hating life towards an attraction for death. Job asks "why" seven times, as he has grief for his situation ([3:11](https://ref.ly/Job3:11), [12](https://ref.ly/Job3:12), [16](https://ref.ly/Job3:16), [20](https://ref.ly/Job3:20), [23](https://ref.ly/Job3:23); see [Psalms 10:1](https://ref.ly/Ps10:1); [22:1](https://ref.ly/Ps22:1); [Jeremiah 20:18](https://ref.ly/Jer20:18); [Lamentations 5:20](https://ref.ly/Lam5:20)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 3:11–JOB 3:24

## Job 3:14 (id: 18529)

People believed the dead kept their identities and social status. Job might have wanted kings and prime ministers to recognize his status as a prince ([1:3](https://ref.ly/Job1:3)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 3:14

## Job 3:15 (id: 18530)

*who had gold, who filled their houses with silver*: This might refer to tombs filled with treasure. However, it more likely refers to the useless storing of wealth that ends in death (as in [3:14](https://ref.ly/Job3:14)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 3:15

## Job 3:20 (id: 18531)

* Job compared *light* to *life* ([33:30](https://ref.ly/Job33:30); see [John 1:4](https://ref.ly/John1:4); [8:12](https://ref.ly/John8:12)).
* *Bitter* might mean:

1. “Angry” ([Judges 18:25](https://ref.ly/Judg18:25)).
2. “Fierce” ([2 Samuel 17:8](https://ref.ly/2Sam17:8)).

## Job 4:1–2 (id: 18639)

* *Eliphaz the Temanite* was probably the oldest and most important of Job’s friends (see study note on 2:11). His speeches are longer and more detailed than the others.
* *who can keep from speaking?*: *Eliphaz* imitated how urgent a message from prophets can be ([4:12–16](https://ref.ly/Job4:12-Job4:16); see [Jeremiah 20:9](https://ref.ly/Jer20:9); [Amos 3:8](https://ref.ly/Amos3:8)).

This section starts three rounds of speeches by Job's three "comforters," each followed by Job's response ([4:1–27:23](https://ref.ly/Job4:1-Job27:23)). In the first round, Job's friends urge him to seek God to regain prosperity.

## Job 4:3–4 (id: 18647)

These were people who were weak, felt depressed, and had low confidence in themselves ([Isaiah 13:7](https://ref.ly/Isa13:7); [35:3](https://ref.ly/Isa35:3); [Ezekiel 7:17](https://ref.ly/Ezek7:17)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 4:3–JOB 4:4

## Job 4:7 (id: 18648)

Job probably considered his children among the *innocent* who died ([1:5](https://ref.ly/Job1:5)). Even Eliphaz must have known that people sometimes "shed innocent blood" (compare [Deuteronomy 19:10](https://ref.ly/Deut19:10); [Proverbs 6:17](https://ref.ly/Prov6:17); [Jeremiah 7:6](https://ref.ly/Jer7:6)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 4:7

## Job 4:8 (id: 18649)

The symbolic use of the language of harvest shows the idea in the Scriptures that actions deserve judgment ([Proverbs 22:8](https://ref.ly/Prov22:8); [Hosea 8:7](https://ref.ly/Hos8:7); [Romans 2:9–11](https://ref.ly/Rom2:9-Rom2:11); [Galatians 6:7–8](https://ref.ly/Gal6:7-Gal6:8)). The New Testament compares the final judgment to a harvest ([Matthew 13:39](https://ref.ly/Matt13:39)). By this principle, Jesus rejected overly simple attempts to analyze people's lives ([Luke 13:4](https://ref.ly/Luke13:4); [John 9:1–3](https://ref.ly/John9:1-John9:3)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 4:8

## Job 4:9 (id: 18650)

*by the blast of His anger they are consumed*: Eliphaz saw the wind in [1:19](https://ref.ly/Job1:19) as God's judgment (compare [Isaiah 40:7](https://ref.ly/Isa40:7); [Hosea 13:15](https://ref.ly/Hos13:15)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 4:9

## Job 4:12–16 (id: 18640)

Eliphaz claimed to be a prophet, suggesting that God spoke to him *secretly* ([Numbers 12:6](https://ref.ly/Num12:6)). Later, God did speak to him, but not to support his advice ([Job 42:7](https://ref.ly/Job42:7)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 4:12–JOB 4:16

## Job 4:13 (id: 18641)

Eliphaz probably referred to the sleep caused by God that links to the *visions* given to prophets ([33:15](https://ref.ly/Job33:15); [Genesis 15:12](https://ref.ly/Gen15:12); [Numbers 12:6](https://ref.ly/Num12:6); [Isaiah 29:10](https://ref.ly/Isa29:10)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 4:13

## Job 4:14 (id: 18642)

* *Fear* often occurs in God's presence ([Genesis 15:12](https://ref.ly/Gen15:12); [Daniel 8:17–18](https://ref.ly/Dan8:17-Dan8:18); [10:8–10](https://ref.ly/Dan10:8-Dan10:10)). But God tells his people not to *fear* ([Genesis 15:1](https://ref.ly/Gen15:1); [26:24](https://ref.ly/Gen26:24); [Isaiah 40:9](https://ref.ly/Isa40:9); [44:8](https://ref.ly/Isa44:8)).
* Eliphaz's *bones* shook like those of a prophet with terrible news to share ([Jeremiah 23:9](https://ref.ly/Jer23:9); [Habakkuk 3:16](https://ref.ly/Hab3:16)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 4:14

## Job 4:15 (id: 18643)

*a spirit* (or *wind*) *glided past my face*: Wind shows God's powerful presence in a physical way ([38:1](https://ref.ly/Job38:1); [Nahum 1:3](https://ref.ly/Nah1:3); [Acts 2:2](https://ref.ly/Acts2:2); compare [1 Kings 19:11](https://ref.ly/1Kgs19:11)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 4:15

## Job 4:17 (id: 18644)

The characters in the book often say that no one is truly *righteous* or *pure* (see [9:2](https://ref.ly/Job9:2); [15:14](https://ref.ly/Job15:14); [25:4](https://ref.ly/Job25:4); [35:7](https://ref.ly/Job35:7)). This is because everyone is flawed ([Psalms 14:3](https://ref.ly/Ps14:3); [53:3](https://ref.ly/Ps53:3); [Romans 3:10–11](https://ref.ly/Rom3:10-Rom3:11)). Eliphaz used these terms to say that humans are full of sin and God has no sin. Job and God used them to show that Job had fulfilled his duties to God. Job and Eliphaz never agreed on what these terms meant. Later, God said that Eliphaz had not spoken about him "accurately" ([Job 42:7](https://ref.ly/Job42:7)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 4:21

## Job 5:1 (id: 18674)

*The holy ones* probably refers back to the angels mentioned in [4:18](https://ref.ly/Job4:18). They are "holy ones" because of they are close to God, not because they have achieved moral perfection ([15:15](https://ref.ly/Job15:15); [Daniel 4:14](https://ref.ly/Dan4:14); [8:13](https://ref.ly/Dan8:13); [Zechariah 14:5](https://ref.ly/Zech14:5)).

* *Appeal to God*: This meant a formal request for help, advice, or removal of blame, sometimes through asking God to forgive ([Amos 5:4](https://ref.ly/Amos5:4), [6](https://ref.ly/Amos5:6)). It could possibly refer to an *appeal* through a message from a prophet ([Genesis 25:22](https://ref.ly/Gen25:22); [1 Samuel 9:9](https://ref.ly/1Sam9:9); [1 Kings 22:8](https://ref.ly/1Kgs22:8)).
* Job wanted to present his *cause* *before* *God.* Later he tried to do that very thing ([Job 13:3](https://ref.ly/Job13:3), [15](https://ref.ly/Job13:15), [18](https://ref.ly/Job13:18); [23:3–8](https://ref.ly/Job23:3-Job23:8); [29:1–31:40](https://ref.ly/Job29:1-Job31:40)).

## Job 5:9–16 (id: 18680)

Eliphaz praised God as the creator and and the one who sustains the universe who performs wonders ([5:9–10](https://ref.ly/Job5:9-Job5:10)). He also praised God as the righteous judge who humbles the powerful and honors poor people ([5:11–16](https://ref.ly/Job5:11-Job5:16)).

## Job 5:13 (id: 18671)

God *catches the wise in their craftiness* ([Proverbs 12:13](https://ref.ly/Prov12:13)). The apostle Paul referred to this idea when he rejected the wisdom of the world ([1 Corinthians 1:19](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:19)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 5:17

## Job 5:19–26 (id: 18673)

* *Six calamities … in seven*: This formula for wise sayings suggests a condition of completion (compare [Proverbs 30:15–31](https://ref.ly/Prov30:15-Prov30:31)).
* This list reflects the blessings and curses of the covenant God gave to Moses ([Leviticus 26](https://ref.ly/Lev26:1-Lev26:46); [Deuteronomy 28](https://ref.ly/Deut28:1-Deut28:68)).

    Eliphaz believed that people in a right relationship with God would avoid:

1. *Famine*, meaning starving. ([Job 5:20](https://ref.ly/Job5:20), [22](https://ref.ly/Job5:22); see [Leviticus 26:4–5](https://ref.ly/Lev26:4-Lev26:5), [10](https://ref.ly/Lev26:10); [Deuteronomy 28:4–6](https://ref.ly/Deut28:4-Deut28:6), [8](https://ref.ly/Deut28:8), [11–12](https://ref.ly/Deut28:11-Deut28:12)).
2. *Battle* and its *destruction* ([Job 5:20](https://ref.ly/Job5:20); [5:21](https://ref.ly/Job5:21), [22](https://ref.ly/Job5:22); see [Leviticus 26:6–8](https://ref.ly/Lev26:6-Lev26:8); [Deuteronomy 28:7](https://ref.ly/Deut28:7), [48](https://ref.ly/Deut28:48)).
3. *Scourge of the tongue,* or words spoken against them (slander).
4. They would even be at *peace* with *wild animals* and *the stones of the field* ([Job 5:23](https://ref.ly/Job5:23); see [Leviticus 26:6](https://ref.ly/Lev26:6)). This *peace* might mean productive fields instead of rocky ones ([2 Kings 3:19](https://ref.ly/2Kgs3:19), [25](https://ref.ly/2Kgs3:25); [Matthew 13:5](https://ref.ly/Matt13:5)). Or it might symbolize broader harmony with creation (see [Psalm 91:11–12](https://ref.ly/Ps91:11-Ps91:12)).

Job responds by criticizing his counselors and questioning God (chapters [6](https://ref.ly/Job6:1-Job6:30) and [7](https://ref.ly/Job7:1-Job7:21)). He explains his intense words by indicating his deep "grief" or "anguish" ([6:2–3](https://ref.ly/Job6:2-Job6:3); [7:11](https://ref.ly/Job7:11)). Job states that Eliphaz has not provided comfort or sympathy as a friend. Instead, Eliphaz chose to argue about out of date religious or theological ideas.

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 6:1–JOB 7:21

## Job 6:3–4 (id: 18685)

In the Old Testament, *arrows* symbolize danger, disease, and destruction from God ([7:20](https://ref.ly/Job7:20); [16:12–13](https://ref.ly/Job16:12-Job16:13); [Deuteronomy 32:23–24](https://ref.ly/Deut32:23-Deut32:24), [42](https://ref.ly/Deut32:42); [Psalms 7:12–13](https://ref.ly/Ps7:12-Ps7:13); [38:2](https://ref.ly/Ps38:2); [64:7](https://ref.ly/Ps64:7); [91:5–6](https://ref.ly/Ps91:5-Ps91:6); [Lamentations 2:4](https://ref.ly/Lam2:4); [3:12–13](https://ref.ly/Lam3:12-Lam3:13); [Ezekiel 5:16](https://ref.ly/Ezek5:16)).

## Job 6:6 (id: 18687)

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 6:6

## Job 6:9 (id: 18688)

At one time, both the prophets Moses and Elijah asked God to end their lives ([Numbers 11:15](https://ref.ly/Num11:15); [1 Kings 19:4](https://ref.ly/1Kgs19:4)).

## Job 6:14–27 (id: 18682)

Job and his friends might have shared a covenant (special agreement) of loyalty and faith (Hebrew *khesed*; see [Genesis 21:23](https://ref.ly/Gen21:23); [Exodus 15:13](https://ref.ly/Exod15:13); [1 Chronicles 16:34](https://ref.ly/1Chr16:34)).

They might have named it after an ancestor who descended from Ishmael ([Genesis 25:15](https://ref.ly/Gen25:15)). It was different from "Teman," which was Eliphaz’s home in Edom.
* *Sheba*, situated in southwest Arabia, was a trading city for valuable goods ([Psalm 72:10](https://ref.ly/Ps72:10), [15](https://ref.ly/Ps72:15); [Isaiah 60:6](https://ref.ly/Isa60:6); [Jeremiah 6:20](https://ref.ly/Jer6:20); [Ezekiel 27:22–23](https://ref.ly/Ezek27:22-Ezek27:23); [38:13](https://ref.ly/Ezek38:13)).

*goes down to Sheol*: This is the first plain mention of Sheol in Job. 

It is described as: 

1. A place of rest from the pressures and distinctions of earth ([3:13–19](https://ref.ly/Job3:13-Job3:19)).
2. "Darkness" ([10:21–22](https://ref.ly/Job10:21-Job10:22); [17:13](https://ref.ly/Job17:13)).

## Job 7:12 (id: 18690)

*The sea* (Hebrew *yam*) and *the monster* (Hebrew *tannin*) symbolize chaos opposing God's order of creation. In Canaanite mythology, "Yam" was the original *sea* god, and "Tannin" was a sea *monster* or a god of the myth of chaos ([Jeremiah 51:34](https://ref.ly/Jer51:34); [Psalm 74:13–14](https://ref.ly/Ps74:13-Ps74:14)). This chaos also appears in Job as "Leviathan" or "Rahab" ([Job 3:8](https://ref.ly/Job3:8); [Isaiah 27:1](https://ref.ly/Isa27:1); [Job 9:13](https://ref.ly/Job9:13); [26:12](https://ref.ly/Job26:12); [Isaiah 51:9](https://ref.ly/Isa51:9)).

* *that You should exalt him*: Compare with [Psalm 8:4–5](https://ref.ly/Ps8:4-Ps8:5), which expresses similar thoughts in a positive way.
* *attend*(Hebrew *paqad*): In [Psalm 8:4](https://ref.ly/Ps8:4), this term means "to honor or care for." Job used it ironically to mean "You bother yourself" (compare with "punished," [Isaiah 26:14](https://ref.ly/Isa26:14)).

Job was not focusing on the end of the universe when the heavens will disappear ([Psalm 102:25–26](https://ref.ly/Ps102:25-Ps102:26); [Isaiah 34:4](https://ref.ly/Isa34:4); [51:6](https://ref.ly/Isa51:6); [Hebrews 1:10–12](https://ref.ly/Heb1:10-Heb1:12)). He was referring to the eternal nature of *the* *heavens* ([Psalm 148:6](https://ref.ly/Ps148:6); see also [Psalms 72:5](https://ref.ly/Ps72:5), [7](https://ref.ly/Ps72:7), [17](https://ref.ly/Ps72:17); [89:29](https://ref.ly/Ps89:29), [37](https://ref.ly/Ps89:37)).

* The Sabeans and Chaldeans were examples of "destroyers" ([1:13–17](https://ref.ly/Job1:13-Job1:17)). But this could mean any destructive force ([1:18–19](https://ref.ly/Job1:18-Job1:19)). A *destroyer* might be an agent of Satan or divine agents that punish evil ([1 Corinthians 10:10](https://ref.ly/1Cor10:10); [Revelation 9:11](https://ref.ly/Rev9:11); [Exodus 12:23](https://ref.ly/Exod12:23); [2 Samuel 24:16](https://ref.ly/2Sam24:16); [2 Chronicles 32:21](https://ref.ly/2Chr32:21); [Acts 12:23](https://ref.ly/Acts12:23); [Hebrews 11:28](https://ref.ly/Heb11:28)).

Like evil people, Job may have experienced hunger. Or, following the ancient Greek Old Testament (Septuagint), the Berean Standard Bible says Job "wanders about as food for vultures.” This would be similar to being “marked for the sword” ([15:22](https://ref.ly/Job15:22)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 15:30

Instead, God attacked him as if he were a threat (see [Job 6:12](https://ref.ly/Job6:12); [Isaiah 42:13](https://ref.ly/Isa42:13)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 16:14

## Job 16:15 (id: 18395)

* Since Job insisted he was innocent, wearing *sackcloth* showed grief, not asking God to forgive him. He might have worn it to show he would never take it off because no one could comfort him ([Genesis 37:34–35](https://ref.ly/Gen37:34-Gen37:35)).
* *I have buried my horn in the dust*: A *horn* symbolized dignity and power ([1 Samuel 2:1](https://ref.ly/1Sam2:1); [Psalms 75:4–5](https://ref.ly/Ps75:4-Ps75:5); [89:17](https://ref.ly/Ps89:17), [24](https://ref.ly/Ps89:24); [92:10](https://ref.ly/Ps92:10); [112:9](https://ref.ly/Ps112:9); [148:14](https://ref.ly/Ps148:14)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 16:15

## Job 16:17 (id: 18396)

* *Free of violence* (Hebrew *lo’\-khamas*): If *violence* is the meaning, Job might have been denying that he was a dangerous warrior who God should attack ([16:12–14](https://ref.ly/Job16:12-Job16:14); see also [Isaiah 59:6](https://ref.ly/Isa59:6); [Jonah 3:8](https://ref.ly/Jonah3:8)).
* Contrary to Eliphaz’s accusation and Bildad’s assumption, Job’s prayer was sincere because he was innocent ([Job 15:4–5](https://ref.ly/Job15:4-Job15:5); [8:6](https://ref.ly/Job8:6); [Genesis 20:5](https://ref.ly/Gen20:5); [Isaiah 59:3](https://ref.ly/Isa59:3)).

## Job 16:19–21 (id: 18399)

*my witness is in heaven*: Job wished for a kind third party to be "a mediator" between him and God (see [9:32–35](https://ref.ly/Job9:32-Job9:35)). Job wanted a heavenly *advocate* who would eventually stand on the earth ([16:19](https://ref.ly/Job16:19); compare [Zechariah 3:1](https://ref.ly/Zech3:1); [Job 19:25](https://ref.ly/Job19:25); compare [1 Samuel 24:15](https://ref.ly/1Sam24:15); [John 14:16](https://ref.ly/John14:16), [26](https://ref.ly/John14:26); [15:26](https://ref.ly/John15:26); [16:7](https://ref.ly/John16:7); [1 John 2:1](https://ref.ly/1John2:1)).

## Job 17:1 (id: 18407)

*My spirit is broken*: This can mean a truly sorry attitude ([Psalm 51:17](https://ref.ly/Ps51:17)). But it usually means a very sad "spirit" ([Proverbs 18:14](https://ref.ly/Prov18:14)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 17:1

## Job 17:2 (id: 18408)

*mockers surround me*: songs of grief (laments) often describe making fun of someone as how evil people respond to the suffering of righteous people ([Psalms 22:7](https://ref.ly/Ps22:7); [69:10–12](https://ref.ly/Ps69:10-Ps69:12); [89:50–52](https://ref.ly/Ps89:50-Ps89:52)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 17:2

## Job 17:3–5 (id: 18409)

*Give me, I pray, the pledge You demand* (literally *please keep my pledge with yourself*): A *pledge* (Hebrew *‘erabon*) can be a deposit that guarantees payment ([Genesis 38:17–20](https://ref.ly/Gen38:17-Gen38:20); [Exodus 22:26–27](https://ref.ly/Exod22:26-Exod22:27); [Deuteronomy 24:10–14](https://ref.ly/Deut24:10-Deut24:14); see [Proverbs 20:16](https://ref.ly/Prov20:16); [27:13](https://ref.ly/Prov27:13)). So, this might suggest God forgiving sin (making atonement). It might also refer to Job’s wish for an advocate to support his cause (see study note on Job 16:19–21).

## Job 19:23 (id: 18428)

Job wanted his words *inscribed* (carved) on a monument, not in a *book*. He wanted a record of his innocence that would last in response to Bildad's claim that he would become forgotten ([18:17](https://ref.ly/Job18:17)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 19:23

## Job 19:25 (id: 18429)

Job's faith in a *Redeemer* (one who saves) could only become fulfilled in Christ. This was also true for his wish for an advocate and a witness in heaven ([9:33](https://ref.ly/Job9:33); [16:19](https://ref.ly/Job16:19)). The term *Redeemer* (Hebrew *go’el*) comes from both criminal and civil law. A person could redeem or take revenge because of the wrong shedding of blood or redeem lost property. This included buying back a slave or marrying the widow who inherited the property ([Numbers 35:12–18](https://ref.ly/Num35:12-Num35:18); [Leviticus 25:25](https://ref.ly/Lev25:25), [47–49](https://ref.ly/Lev25:47-Lev25:49); [27:11–13](https://ref.ly/Lev27:11-Lev27:13); [Ruth 3:13](https://ref.ly/Ruth3:13)). 

The Old Testament recognized the Lord as *Redeemer* ([Exodus 6:6](https://ref.ly/Exod6:6); [Psalms 19:14](https://ref.ly/Ps19:14); [103:4](https://ref.ly/Ps103:4); [Proverbs 23:10–11](https://ref.ly/Prov23:10-Prov23:11); [Isaiah 43:1](https://ref.ly/Isa43:1); [Isaiah 54:5](https://ref.ly/Isa54:5)). New Testament Christians know the *Redeemer* as the Lord Jesus Christ ([Ephesians 1:7](https://ref.ly/Eph1:7), [14](https://ref.ly/Eph1:14); [Hebrews 9:12](https://ref.ly/Heb9:12); [1 Peter 1:18](https://ref.ly/1Pet1:18)). Job wanted his *Redeemer* to declare his innocence (see [Job 1:1](https://ref.ly/Job1:1) and corresponding study note).

## Job 19:27 (id: 18431)

*I will see Him for myself*: This thought is like the psalmist's in "when I awake" ([Psalm 17:15](https://ref.ly/Ps17:15)). For Job, this hope could only come true by seeing God at the end of time when his body transformed ([Matthew 5:8](https://ref.ly/Matt5:8); [1 Corinthians 13:12](https://ref.ly/1Cor13:12); [1 John 3:2](https://ref.ly/1John3:2); [Revelation 1:7](https://ref.ly/Rev1:7); [1 Corinthians 15:43–53](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:43-1Cor15:53); [Philippians 3:21](https://ref.ly/Phil3:21)).

## Job 20:25 (id: 18454)

*Terrors*: These are terrors of death. Although the specific words "of death" are not in the Hebrew text, they are understood because the description talks about an arrowhead that glistens with blood (literally *with gall*). This indicates a deadly hit on an important organ in the body ([6:4](https://ref.ly/Job6:4); [16:13](https://ref.ly/Job16:13); [Psalm 7:12](https://ref.ly/Ps7:12)).

These should be rewards for righteous people ([Proverbs 17:6](https://ref.ly/Prov17:6)).

Job released his earlier doubts ([9:14–20](https://ref.ly/Job9:14-Job9:20), [32](https://ref.ly/Job9:32)). Now he expresses confidence that he could present his *complaint* to God with success.

*plead my case*: Job wanted to present his legal *case* to God ([13:3](https://ref.ly/Job13:3), [18](https://ref.ly/Job13:18), [22](https://ref.ly/Job13:22); [16:21](https://ref.ly/Job16:21); [31:35](https://ref.ly/Job31:35)). Abraham pleaded directly with God about Sodom ([Genesis 18:25–32](https://ref.ly/Gen18:25-Gen18:32)).

## Job 23:6–7 (id: 18488)

* Earlier, Job thought God was too powerful for him to "summon" ([9:19](https://ref.ly/Job9:19)).

Here, he showed more hope that God would give him a fair legal hearing.
* *delivered*: Job wanted God to declare him innocent, not forgive him as if he were guilty ([13:18](https://ref.ly/Job13:18); see [Psalms 17:2–3](https://ref.ly/Ps17:2-Ps17:3); [26:1–3](https://ref.ly/Ps26:1-Ps26:3)).

* Job had earlier complained about being in *darkness* ([Job 19:8](https://ref.ly/Job19:8)). Eliphaz and Bildad said this fate is for the evil person ([15:22](https://ref.ly/Job15:22); [22:1](https://ref.ly/Job22:1); [18:6](https://ref.ly/Job18:6), [18](https://ref.ly/Job18:18)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 24:3

## Job 24:6 (id: 18496)

*glean the vineyards of the wicked*: Job described the desperate situation of poor people. If someone stole their fields like in the case of Naboth's vineyard, the poor person would harvest for the thieves instead of for themselves ([24:2](https://ref.ly/Job24:2); see [1 Kings 21:1–29](https://ref.ly/1Kgs21:1-1Kgs21:29)). They would only get the bits that remained. If the poor had to *glean* from *fields* of the *wicked* people, they would receive nothing ([Leviticus 19:10](https://ref.ly/Lev19:10); [23:22](https://ref.ly/Lev23:22)). But if they would try to *gather* from the fields of just people, they would be something left for them ([Leviticus 19:9–10](https://ref.ly/Lev19:9-Lev19:10); [23:22](https://ref.ly/Lev23:22); [Ruth 2:1–23](https://ref.ly/Ruth2:1-Ruth2:23)).

## Job 24:18–24 (id: 18491)

These ideas seem to go against Job's observations. Some scholars think Bildad or Zophar might have said them. However, Job might have been speaking against evil people, making fun of his friends' opinions by quoting them. Or he might have meant that the fate of evil people also affects those in a right relationship with God. His friends described this earlier ([5:2–7](https://ref.ly/Job5:2-Job5:7); [15:17–25](https://ref.ly/Job15:17-Job15:25); [8:8–19](https://ref.ly/Job8:8-Job8:19); [18:5–21](https://ref.ly/Job18:5-Job18:21); [20:4–29](https://ref.ly/Job20:4-Job20:29); [21:23–26](https://ref.ly/Job21:23-Job21:26)).

A person can achieve it only after suffering ([22:21–23](https://ref.ly/Job22:21-Job22:23)).

Compare with [Psalms 35:15](https://ref.ly/Ps35:15); [69:12](https://ref.ly/Ps69:12); [Mark 14:65](https://ref.ly/Mark14:65); [15:17–20](https://ref.ly/Mark15:17-Mark15:20).

Job might have been expressing how he saw himself, how others saw him, or both. By saying he was *a* *brother of jackals, a companion to owls,* Job might have been describing his deep grief ([Micah 1:8](https://ref.ly/Mic1:8)).

* Job made a promise with himself about his eyes, including an oath against himself (curse) (see [Matthew 5:28–29](https://ref.ly/Matt5:28-Matt5:29)). Job might have focused on wrong desire because the eyes are often the first to commit sin ([Genesis 3:6](https://ref.ly/Gen3:6)).
* Looking with wrong desire at *a virgin* violates the spirit of the seventh commandment ([Deuteronomy 5:18](https://ref.ly/Deut5:18), see [Matthew 5:27–28](https://ref.ly/Matt5:27-Matt5:28)). It could violate the tenth commandment as well ([Deuteronomy 5:21](https://ref.ly/Deut5:21)).

* If Job desired his neighbor's possessions, he would violate the tenth commandment ([Deuteronomy 5:21](https://ref.ly/Deut5:21)).

The sins of adultery and worshiping the sun and moon had the death penalty (compare [31:1](https://ref.ly/Job31:1), [9–12](https://ref.ly/Job31:9-Job31:12)). Both were sins that tempted the inner being of a person through the eyes. Judges tried both types of sin in court.

The passage connects three ideas to the belief that God can do no wrong ([34:10](https://ref.ly/Job34:10), [12](https://ref.ly/Job34:12)): 

1. God rewards or punishes people based on their actions ([34:11](https://ref.ly/Job34:11));
2. As the creator, God does not have to answer to anyone ([34:13](https://ref.ly/Job34:13)).
3. Every living being relies on God for life. God can take life away without being wrong ([34:14–15](https://ref.ly/Job34:14-Job34:15); compare [Romans 9:19–29](https://ref.ly/Rom9:19-Rom9:29)).

When God shows justice openly, it causes evil people to have proper fear ([Deuteronomy 21:21](https://ref.ly/Deut21:21); [1 Timothy 5:20](https://ref.ly/1Tim5:20)). This leads to public joy among people in a right relationship with God (compare [Exodus 14:30–31](https://ref.ly/Exod14:30-Exod14:31)).

* Bildad ([25:5–6](https://ref.ly/Job25:5-Job25:6)).

## Job 36:31 (id: 18610)

The Hebrew *yadin* typically means *he judges* or *he governs.* But some commentators propose an alternate reading, *yazun* (meaning "he nourishes"). This aligns with the theme of God's provision([Job 38:26](https://ref.ly/Job38:26); [Psalms 65:9–13](https://ref.ly/Ps65:9-Ps65:13); [104:13–15](https://ref.ly/Ps104:13-Ps104:15), [27–28](https://ref.ly/Ps104:27-Ps104:28)). The more common meaning of *yadin* is “judge,” which would mean that God does all things to bless his people and judge his enemies ([Job 37:11–13](https://ref.ly/Job37:11-Job37:13); [38:22–23](https://ref.ly/Job38:22-Job38:23); see [Genesis 6:17](https://ref.ly/Gen6:17); [19:24](https://ref.ly/Gen19:24); [Exodus 9:23–25](https://ref.ly/Exod9:23-Exod9:25); [Joshua 10:11–14](https://ref.ly/Josh10:11-Josh10:14); [1 Samuel 12:18](https://ref.ly/1Sam12:18)).

*heart … mind*: These words can also mean "ibis"and "rooster*."* The Egyptians believed the ibis bird knew about the Nile's flooding, the most important event in Egypt. Israel’s rabbis (religious teachers with authority) believed the rooster bird could predict rain or its distinctive sound (crowing) marked day and night. The question would then be *Who taught the ibis and the rooster?* See also [Psalm 51:6](https://ref.ly/Ps51:6); [Proverbs 2:6](https://ref.ly/Prov2:6); [James 1:5](https://ref.ly/Jas1:5), [17](https://ref.ly/Jas1:17).

## Job 39:30 (id: 18635)

Where there is a dead body, you will find the eagle feeding on the remains ([Ezekiel 39:17–19](https://ref.ly/Ezek39:17-Ezek39:19); [Matthew 24:28](https://ref.ly/Matt24:28); [Luke 17:37](https://ref.ly/Luke17:37)).

## Job 40:1–2 (id: 18651)

The ancient Greek Old Testament (Septuagint) does not include the end of God's first speech.

## Job 40:3–5 (id: 18654)

Job's short and humble reply does not admit guilt, but it does admit how "insignificant" he is ([40:4](https://ref.ly/Job40:4)). Earlier, he believed he could approach God like a prince or even question him ([31:37](https://ref.ly/Job31:37); [13:22–23](https://ref.ly/Job13:22-Job13:23)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 40:3–JOB 40:5

## Job 40:4 (id: 18655)

* *I am insignificant* (compare [42:6](https://ref.ly/Job42:6)): Job was not asking God to forgive his sin. Like Abraham, he recognized that he was not worthy ([Genesis 18:27](https://ref.ly/Gen18:27)).
* Job had asked those comforting him to cover their mouths to show shock ([21:5](https://ref.ly/Job21:5)). Here, he does so himself in reaction to his own inappropriate words.

## Job 40:5 (id: 18656)

*I have nothing to add*: He had no more accusations against God and would not argue again.

## Job 40:8 (id: 18658)

Job's words had angered Elihu ([10:7](https://ref.ly/Job10:7); [27:2](https://ref.ly/Job27:2); [31:35–37](https://ref.ly/Job31:35-Job31:37); [32:2](https://ref.ly/Job32:2); [34:5](https://ref.ly/Job34:5)). Now, God himself challenged Job's words.

## Job 40:11–12 (id: 18652)

Job could not humble proud people without God's authority ([Isaiah 2:11–12](https://ref.ly/Isa2:11-Isa2:12), [17](https://ref.ly/Isa2:17); [James 4:6](https://ref.ly/Jas4:6); [1 Peter 5:5–6](https://ref.ly/1Pet5:5-1Pet5:6); [Malachi 4:3](https://ref.ly/Mal4:3); [Romans 16:20](https://ref.ly/Rom16:20)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 40:11–JOB 40:12

## Job 40:15–24 (id: 18653)

* After listing natural animals, God described *Behemoth* and "Leviathan" as creatures humans cannot control ([39:1–30](https://ref.ly/Job39:1-Job39:30); [40:15–24](https://ref.ly/Job40:15-Job40:24); [41:1–34](https://ref.ly/Job41:1-Job41:34)). Job could not control the wild donkey or *ox* ([39:5–12](https://ref.ly/Job39:5-Job39:12); [40:15–24](https://ref.ly/Job40:15-Job40:24)). However, God created and could control them, and Job had to accept this fact ([41:2](https://ref.ly/Job41:2)).
* Here, *Behemoth* appears to be a natural creature:

1. It is an animal God made, just as he made Job ([40:15](https://ref.ly/Job40:15)).
2. It is not a fierce predator but eats *grass like an ox* ([40:15](https://ref.ly/Job40:15)).
3. It is in a poem about God’s creation of the natural world, not in a myth about the world's formation. Most commentators think *Behemoth* is the hippopotamus, a large, grass\-eating animal ([40:15–19](https://ref.ly/Job40:15-Job40:19)). It rests in the river among lotus plants and reeds ([40:21](https://ref.ly/Job40:21)). Like the wild *ox*, *Behemoth* is strong ([40:16–18](https://ref.ly/Job40:16-Job40:18), [24](https://ref.ly/Job40:24); [39:11](https://ref.ly/Job39:11)). Yet it is mostly peaceful ([40:20–23](https://ref.ly/Job40:20-Job40:23)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 40:15–JOB 40:24

## Job 41:1 (id: 18659)

Unlike the peaceful Behemoth ([Job 40:15–24](https://ref.ly/Job40:15-Job40:24)), Leviathan was a threat (see also [Job 3:8](https://ref.ly/Job3:8); [Psalms 74:14](https://ref.ly/Ps74:14); [104:26](https://ref.ly/Ps104:26); [Isaiah 27:1](https://ref.ly/Isa27:1)). Most scholars think Leviathan was like a crocodile, with its powerful jaws and tough skin twisting and turning in the water ([Job 41:14](https://ref.ly/Job41:14); [41:15–17](https://ref.ly/Job41:15-Job41:17), [23](https://ref.ly/Job41:23); [41:31–32](https://ref.ly/Job41:31-Job41:32)). But Leviathan is a fire\-breathing dragon that wraps around the sun to cause the sun to seem covered ([41:18–21](https://ref.ly/Job41:18-Job41:21); [3:8–9](https://ref.ly/Job3:8-Job3:9)). 

The background for Leviathan is the seven\-headed sea monster symbolizing chaos in ancient Near Eastern mythology. In the Bible, this wild sea creature often represents chaos and evil, whose head the Lord crushes ([Psalm 74:14](https://ref.ly/Ps74:14); [Isaiah 27:1](https://ref.ly/Isa27:1); compare [Job 9:13](https://ref.ly/Job9:13); [26:12](https://ref.ly/Job26:12); [Psalm 89:9–10](https://ref.ly/Ps89:9-Ps89:10); [Isaiah 30:7](https://ref.ly/Isa30:7); [51:9](https://ref.ly/Isa51:9)). Later in the Bible, Satan is linked to the ancient serpent and great dragon ([Genesis 3](https://ref.ly/Gen3:1-Gen3:24); [Revelation 12:9](https://ref.ly/Rev12:9); [20:2](https://ref.ly/Rev20:2)). Christ and his followers crush his head ([Romans 16:20](https://ref.ly/Rom16:20)).

## Job 42:1–6 (id: 18660)

Job understood the message of God’s speeches: *I know that You can do all things*. Nothing is too hard for him ([Genesis 18:14](https://ref.ly/Gen18:14); [Jeremiah 32:17](https://ref.ly/Jer32:17); [Matthew 19:26](https://ref.ly/Matt19:26)). Job says, *No plan of Yours can be thwarted* ([Job 23:13](https://ref.ly/Job23:13); [Isaiah 14:27](https://ref.ly/Isa14:27); [46:10](https://ref.ly/Isa46:10)). Job realized how different he was from God.

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 42:1–JOB 42:6

## Job 42:5 (id: 18668)

*now my eyes have seen You*: Before this, Job had not *seen* God (see [23:8](https://ref.ly/Job23:8)). Now, like the prophet Isaiah, he has been in God's presence and feels overwhelmed by how holy God is ([Isaiah 6:1](https://ref.ly/Isa6:1)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 42:5

## Job 42:7 (id: 18669)

* *Eliphaz the Temanite* was the spokesperson for the friends, probably because of he was older. Eliphaz had a false claim that his advice came from visions of prophecy ([4:12–16](https://ref.ly/Job4:12-Job4:16)). Now God spoke to him, but not to support his message.
* Unlike his three friends, Job spoke accurately about God (compare [13:7–10](https://ref.ly/Job13:7-Job13:10)). Job’s direct questions were more effective in finding out the truth about God than the friends’ shallow definitions of doctrine.

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 42:7

## Job 42:8–9 (id: 18670)

* *The LORD* made *Job* the "mediator" that *Job* had hoped to find for himself and that Elihu wanted to be ([9:33](https://ref.ly/Job9:33); [16:19–21](https://ref.ly/Job16:19-Job16:21); [19:25](https://ref.ly/Job19:25); [32:1–37:24](https://ref.ly/Job32:1-Job37:24)).
* *go to My servant Job*: God wanted Job’s friends to make peace with *Job* before they offered their gifts ([Matthew 5:23–24](https://ref.ly/Matt5:23-Matt5:24)).
* *My servant Job will pray for you*: He had also prayed for his children ([1:5](https://ref.ly/Job1:5); compare [James 5:16](https://ref.ly/Jas5:16); [1 John 5:16](https://ref.ly/1John5:16)).
* When *the LORD* accepted Job’s prayer*,* it ironically fulfilled Eliphaz’s promise ([Job 22:26–30](https://ref.ly/Job22:26-Job22:30)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 42:8–JOB 42:9

## Job 42:10 (id: 18661)

Job's fortunes probably included his health ([42:16–17](https://ref.ly/Job42:16-Job42:17)). God created humans to bless them, not to do them harm (curse).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 42:10

## Job 42:11 (id: 18662)

* Even though God restored Job, he still needed comfort for the loss of his children. His family and former friends continued to support him, following Job's earlier practices, taking over where the three friends had stopped ([4:4](https://ref.ly/Job4:4); [16:5](https://ref.ly/Job16:5); [2:11](https://ref.ly/Job2:11); compare [2 Corinthians 7:6](https://ref.ly/2Cor7:6)).
* The money given to Job was not just charity to increase his wealth again. It was also to honor him and gain favor from an influential man (for example, [Proverbs 18:16](https://ref.ly/Prov18:16)). It might also have been to ease any lack of favor (for example, [Genesis 32:20](https://ref.ly/Gen32:20); [33:10](https://ref.ly/Gen33:10); [43:11](https://ref.ly/Gen43:11); [1 Samuel 25:27](https://ref.ly/1Sam25:27)).
* Women wore *a gold ring* in their nose ([Genesis 24:47](https://ref.ly/Gen24:47); [Proverbs 11:22](https://ref.ly/Prov11:22); [Isaiah 3:21](https://ref.ly/Isa3:21)). Both men and women wore them on the ears ([Genesis 35:4](https://ref.ly/Gen35:4); [Exodus 32:2–3](https://ref.ly/Exod32:2-Exod32:3); [Judges 8:24](https://ref.ly/Judg8:24)).

## Job 42:12 (id: 18663)

When God blessed Job, it ironically fulfilled Bildad’s promise ([8:7](https://ref.ly/Job8:7)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 42:12

## Job 42:14 (id: 18664)

* The names of Job’s new daughters reflect his good fortune God had renewed:
* *Jemimah* means “dove” (see [Song 2:14](https://ref.ly/Song2:14)).
* *Keziah* means “cassia” or “cinnamon flower” (see [Psalm 45:8](https://ref.ly/Ps45:8)).
* *Keren\-happuch* means “horn of antimony,” which is a shiny container for make\-up.

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 42:14

## Job 42:15 (id: 18665)

*their father granted them an inheritance among their brothers*:Daughters usually inherited only if there were no male children ([Numbers 27](https://ref.ly/Num27:1-Num27:23); [36](https://ref.ly/Num36:1-Num36:13)). Perhaps Job's unusual action indicated his great wealth. Only a rich man could give some wealth to the families into which his daughters would marry.

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 42:15

## Job 42:16 (id: 18666)

* Job lived for 140 more years, which was about twice as long as a normal life ([Psalm 90:10](https://ref.ly/Ps90:10)). If God gave him double what he had before ([Job 42:10](https://ref.ly/Job42:10)), Job may have already been 70 years old, making his total life 210 years. This would fit the time of the early patriarchs in the Bible (see [Genesis 25:7](https://ref.ly/Gen25:7); [35:28](https://ref.ly/Gen35:28); [47:28](https://ref.ly/Gen47:28); [50:26](https://ref.ly/Gen50:26); [Deuteronomy 34:7](https://ref.ly/Deut34:7); [Joshua 24:29](https://ref.ly/Josh24:29)).
* *to the fourth generation*: God blessed Job by letting him live long enough to see his children, grandchildren, great\-grandchildren, and great\-great\-grandchildren grow up ([Genesis 50:23](https://ref.ly/Gen50:23); [Psalm 128:6](https://ref.ly/Ps128:6)).

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 42:16

## Job 42:17 (id: 18667)

* The patriarchs ("first fathers") Abraham and Isaac also died at an old age ([Genesis 25:8](https://ref.ly/Gen25:8); [35:29](https://ref.ly/Gen35:29)). Job too lived a long, full life. This fulfilled Eliphaz’s promise ([Job 5:26](https://ref.ly/Job5:26)). His promise had its basis on God's general promise ([Deuteronomy 6:2](https://ref.ly/Deut6:2); [Psalm 91:16](https://ref.ly/Ps91:16)).
* At the end of the book, the ancient Greek Old Testament (Septuagint) adds a note saying that Job will resurrect from the dead at the final resurrection. It also provides information about where and when Job and those who descended from him lived.
