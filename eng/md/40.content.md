## Matthew 1:1 (id: 21648)

* *a record of the ancestors*: This phrase introduces [1:1–17](https://ref.ly/Matt1:1-Matt1:17). A similar phrase appears in Genesis to start each section of that book.
* *Jesus … David … Abraham*: These names repeat in reverse order in the list of Jesus' ancestors. This is a literary form called *chiasm* (arrangement of elements in mirror\-image). Identifying Jesus as a descendant of David introduces him as the Messiah (see [Matthew 12:23](https://ref.ly/Matt12:23); [22:42–45](https://ref.ly/Matt22:42-Matt22:45)). The link to Abraham emphasizes God's promise to Israel and how the covenant (agreement) extends to include all nations (see [Matthew 28:16–20](https://ref.ly/Matt28:16-Matt28:20); [Genesis 12:3](https://ref.ly/Gen12:3)).

## Matthew 1:1–2.23 (id: 21640)

This story shows how certain parts of the life of Jesus fulfilled Old Testament prophecies. This includes: 

* his family history and birth (chapter [1](https://ref.ly/Matt1:1-Matt1:25)), and
* the places he lived as a child (chapter [2](https://ref.ly/Matt2:1-Matt2:23)).

The story also shows how efforts to stop the plan of God do not work ([2:1–15](https://ref.ly/Matt2:1-Matt2:15); see also [27:62–66](https://ref.ly/Matt27:62-Matt27:66)).

## Matthew 1:5 (id: 21653)

Rahab was a gentile prostitute who risked her life to hide the two spies of Joshua in Jericho ([Joshua 2:1–21](https://ref.ly/Josh2:1-Josh2:21)). Her place in the Messiah's family tree emphasizes the grace of God. She is praised for her faith in Israel's God and her good actions ([Hebrews 11:31](https://ref.ly/Heb11:31); [James 2:25](https://ref.ly/Jas2:25)).

## Matthew 1:7 (id: 21654)

*Asa* (Greek *Asaph*): this likely refers to the Old Testament king ([1 Kings 15:9–24](https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:9-1Kgs15:24); [1 Chronicles 3:10](https://ref.ly/1Chr3:10)) and not the psalmist Asaph ([1 Chronicles 6:39](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:39); [25:1–2](https://ref.ly/1Chr25:1-1Chr25:2); [Psalms 50](https://ref.ly/Ps50:1-Ps50:23), [73–83](https://ref.ly/Ps73:1-Ps83:18)). Matthew focuses on the family line from David to the Messiah.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 1:7
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Matthew 1:8 (id: 21655)

*father of* (or *ancestor of*): Here this term refers to multiple generations ([2 Chronicles 21:1–26:1](https://ref.ly/2Chr21:1-2Chr21:26)). The same is true for Josiah ([Matthew 1:11](https://ref.ly/Matt1:11)) and Shealtiel ([1:12](https://ref.ly/Matt1:12)). The family line skips Ahaziah, Joash, and Amaziah ([2 Kings 8:24](https://ref.ly/2Kgs8:24); [1 Chronicles 3:11](https://ref.ly/1Chr3:11); [2 Chronicles 22:1](https://ref.ly/2Chr22:1), [11](https://ref.ly/2Chr22:11); [24:27](https://ref.ly/2Chr24:27)). Perhaps this is because of their connection to Ahab and Jezebel.

## Matthew 1:12–16 (id: 21642)

The Old Testament is clearly the source for [1:1–11](https://ref.ly/Matt1:1-Matt1:11). Matthew probably also used royal records and oral traditions for [1:12–16](https://ref.ly/Matt1:12-Matt1:16).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 1:12–MAT 1:16

## Matthew 1:16 (id: 21644)

This family history follows Joseph, who is part of the family line of King David (see also study note on Luke 3:23–38).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 1:16
* **Associated Articles:** Luke 3:23-38 (ID: 20936)

## Matthew 1:17 (id: 21645)

Matthew says each time period has fourteen generations. But the first and third periods list only thirteen. A traditional Jewish and Old Testament method would count King David in both the first and second groups. It would include Jesus in the third group. 

This suggests Matthew is probably emphasizing the *gematria* (a system where letters represent numbers). The letters in the Hebrew word *dawid* (meaning "David") add up to fourteen. Matthew is emphasizing Jesus’ credentials as the Messiah ([1:1](https://ref.ly/Matt1:1)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 1:17
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Matthew 1:18 (id: 21646)

* *Jesus Christ* (literally *Jesus the Christ*)*:* *Christ* is not a personal name. *Christ* is a title that means "Messiah" or "God's chosen one."
* *pledged in marriage*: In Judaism, engagement (or betrothal) was a permanent relationship ([Malachi 2:14](https://ref.ly/Mal2:14)). It could only end through legal action. So, by law, Mary was Joseph’s wife and he was her husband (see [Matthew 1:20](https://ref.ly/Matt1:20); [Deuteronomy 22:23–24](https://ref.ly/Deut22:23-Deut22:24)). This was true even though they had not had sexual relations. Since Mary was a virgin when the Holy Spirit conceived Jesus, it proves Jesus’ divine nature.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 1:18
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Matthew 1:19 (id: 21647)

As a righteous man—that is, as one who obeyed the law (see [Luke 1:6](https://ref.ly/Luke1:6))—Joseph could not take Mary as his wife since she was a suspected adulteress. He could exonerate himself by publicly exposing Mary to trial and having her put to death ([Deut 22:23–27](https://ref.ly/Deut22:23-Deut22:27); cp. [Num 5:11–31](https://ref.ly/Num5:11-Num5:31)), or pay a fine and break the engagement (see also *Mishnah Sotah* 1:1–5\). Joseph mercifully decided to do the latter quietly.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 1:19
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Matthew 1:20 (id: 21649)

The angel of the Lord declared to Joseph in a dream (see [2:12–13](https://ref.ly/Matt2:12-Matt2:13), [19](https://ref.ly/Matt2:19), [22](https://ref.ly/Matt2:22)) that Mary had been neither seduced nor violated; instead, the baby was conceived by the Holy Spirit ([Luke 1:34–35](https://ref.ly/Luke1:34-Luke1:35)), who often has a creative and life\-generating role ([Gen 1:2](https://ref.ly/Gen1:2); [Ezek 37:1–14](https://ref.ly/Ezek37:1-Ezek37:14); [John 3:5–8](https://ref.ly/John3:5-John3:8)).

## Matthew 1:21 (id: 21650)

Jesus is the Greek form of the Hebrew name *Yeshua,* which means “The Lord saves.” The name appropriately describes his role: he will save his people from their sins. • His people may refer either to Israel as a nation ([2:6](https://ref.ly/Matt2:6)) or to the Messiah’s people, the church, which is comprised of both Jews and Gentiles ([4:15–16](https://ref.ly/Matt4:15-Matt4:16); [16:18](https://ref.ly/Matt16:18); [28:18–20](https://ref.ly/Matt28:18-Matt28:20)).

* **Associated Articles:** 

## Matthew 1:22–23 (id: 21651)

Jesus’ birth from a virgin fulfills [Isa 7:14](https://ref.ly/Isa7:14). The Hebrew term ‘almah (*virgin* or *young maiden*) was translated parthenos (“virgin”) in the Greek Old Testament that Matthew quotes. Matthew understands the ‘almah of Isaiah as foreshadowing the Virgin Mary.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 1:22–MAT 1:23
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Matthew 1:25 (id: 21652)

* *he had no union with her until she gave birth to a Son*: this might indicate that Joseph had sexual relations with Mary after Jesus was born. (Some traditions teach that Mary remained a virgin throughout her life.)
* Joseph named him Jesus, showing he accepted the child as his own.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 1:25
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Matthew 2:1 (id: 21879)

* Bethlehem was King David’s hometown ([1 Samuel 16:1–13](https://ref.ly/1Sam16:1-1Sam16:13); [John 7:42](https://ref.ly/John7:42)).
* King Herod was also called "Herod the Great." He had a rapid increase in power. He went from being the governor of Galilee to the king of Galilee, Judea, and Samaria. He was king from 37–4 BC. He was very loyal to Rome. He was famous for impressive building projects. This included a major renovation of the Temple in Jerusalem. His rule also included family conflicts, suspicion, and the murder of his own family members and innocent children (Josephus, *Antiquities* 15\.7\.1–5; [Matthew 2:16–18](https://ref.ly/Matt2:16-Matt2:18)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 2:1
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Matthew 2:1–2 (id: 21872)

Attentiveness to the star indicates that the wise men were astrologers; their awareness of the Old Testament (perhaps [Num 24:17](https://ref.ly/Num24:17)) suggests that they were from Babylonia, where Jews were numerous. The men were Gentiles, which anticipates Gentile acceptance into the Kingdom of God ([Matt 8:11–12](https://ref.ly/Matt8:11-Matt8:12); [15:21–28](https://ref.ly/Matt15:21-Matt15:28); [28:16–20](https://ref.ly/Matt28:16-Matt28:20)). Throughout the entire Gospel, unlikely Gentiles worship the Jewish Messiah, while the Jewish leaders (Herod, high priests, teachers of religious law, Pharisees) oppose him.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 2:1–MAT 2:2
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Matthew 2:2 (id: 21883)

Matthew regularly describes Jesus as receiving worship ([2:2](https://ref.ly/Matt2:2), [8](https://ref.ly/Matt2:8), [11](https://ref.ly/Matt2:11); [8:2](https://ref.ly/Matt8:2); [9:18](https://ref.ly/Matt9:18); [14:33](https://ref.ly/Matt14:33); [15:25](https://ref.ly/Matt15:25); [20:20](https://ref.ly/Matt20:20); [28:9](https://ref.ly/Matt28:9), [17](https://ref.ly/Matt28:17)), thus identifying Jesus as God.

Herod was deeply disturbed because he feared this child would rival him as king of the Jews.

* **Associated Articles:** 

## Matthew 2:4 (id: 21885)

The leading priests had political and religious clout and ministered predominantly in the Temple (see [21:23](https://ref.ly/Matt21:23)). Herod gathered the teachers of religious law because they were trained to know Old Testament prophecies and were often influential Pharisees.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 2:4

## Matthew 2:6 (id: 21886)

Bethlehem, a small village, had a privileged status as the birthplace of King David. The religious leaders knew from the prophets ([1:22](https://ref.ly/Matt1:22)) that the Messiah would be born there. • King David had been a shepherd in his youth, and as king he became the shepherd of Israel ([2 Sam 5:2](https://ref.ly/2Sam5:2)). [Micah 5:2–4](https://ref.ly/Mic5:2-Mic5:4) foresees the Messiah as a shepherd (cp. [Ps 23:1](https://ref.ly/Ps23:1)).

## Matthew 2:8–10 (id: 21887)

The star was placed by God to guide the wise men to the Messiah (see [Num 24:17](https://ref.ly/Num24:17)); the details are unknown.

## Matthew 2:11 (id: 21873)

The wise men offered extravagant gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh to the King (see [Ps 72:10–17](https://ref.ly/Ps72:10-Ps72:17); [Isa 60](https://ref.ly/Isa60:1-Isa60:22)). The tradition that there were three wise men originated from the number of gifts, but the text does not specify how many wise men there were.

John the Baptist announced Jesus’ coming (see [Mark 1:1–11](https://ref.ly/Mark1:1-Mark1:11); [Luke 3:1–22](https://ref.ly/Luke3:1-Luke3:22); [John 1:6–8](https://ref.ly/John1:6-John1:8), [19–34](https://ref.ly/John1:19-John1:34)) and prepared people to receive him ([Matt 3:3](https://ref.ly/Matt3:3)). John attracted large crowds ([3:5](https://ref.ly/Matt3:5)) and a group of disciples ([9:14](https://ref.ly/Matt9:14)). This group continued for a short time as a movement, even as the Christian church emerged (see [Acts 18:24–28](https://ref.ly/Acts18:24-Acts18:28)). • John’s locale in the Judean wilderness had symbolic significance: The wilderness was associated with the giving of the law (see [Exod 19:1](https://ref.ly/Exod19:1)) and with God’s final redemption of Israel at the end of history (see [Isa 40:3](https://ref.ly/Isa40:3)).

The prophetic call to return to God in repentance (cp.

Isaiah had spoken of a messenger preparing a highway in the wilderness for Israel’s God to return to the land ([Isa 40:1–11](https://ref.ly/Isa40:1-Isa40:11)).

We’re safe: Some had wrongly assumed that, since they were descendants of Abraham*,* they were exempt from judgment. • A prominent theme in Matthew is how God will create new children of Abraham by bringing the Gentiles into God’s people and removing from his people Jews who reject the Messiah (see [8:11–12](https://ref.ly/Matt8:11-Matt8:12); [21:43](https://ref.ly/Matt21:43); [22:1–14](https://ref.ly/Matt22:1-Matt22:14); [28:16–20](https://ref.ly/Matt28:16-Matt28:20); [Rom 4:9–25](https://ref.ly/Rom4:9-Rom4:25); [Gal 3:6–14](https://ref.ly/Gal3:6-Gal3:14), [29](https://ref.ly/Gal3:29)).

who is greater than I am: Despite his popularity and growing following, John had a clear sense of his role as subordinate to the Messiah. • I’m not worthy even to be his slave: In Jewish culture, to remove and carry someone’s sandals, even those of a rabbi, was too lowly a task even for the rabbi’s disciple. It was a job reserved for slaves. • with the Holy Spirit and with fire: This happened at Pentecost (see [Joel 2:28–29](https://ref.ly/Joel2:28-Joel2:29); [Acts 2:1–47](https://ref.ly/Acts2:1-Acts2:47)); the ministry of Jesus, empowered by the Holy Spirit (see [Matt 12:28](https://ref.ly/Matt12:28); [Luke 4:14](https://ref.ly/Luke4:14)), may also be included. Fire may refer to purification ([Zech 13:9](https://ref.ly/Zech13:9)) or judgment ([Mal 4:1](https://ref.ly/Mal4:1); see [Isa 1:25](https://ref.ly/Isa1:25); [4:4](https://ref.ly/Isa4:4); [Mal 3:2–3](https://ref.ly/Mal3:2-Mal3:3)).

Farmers would use a winnowing fork to toss harvested grain into the air, allowing the useless husks (chaff) to blow away. The Messiah’s ministry divides all humanity into two groups: (1\) the wheat, that is, those who respond, forming the new people of God; and (2\) the chaff, the unrepentant (see [3:8](https://ref.ly/Matt3:8)).

my dearly loved Son (see [Ps 2:7](https://ref.ly/Ps2:7)): The title “Son of God” reveals and clarifies Jesus’ nature and role (see [Matt 4:3](https://ref.ly/Matt4:3), [6](https://ref.ly/Matt4:6); [14:33](https://ref.ly/Matt14:33); [16:16](https://ref.ly/Matt16:16); [17:5](https://ref.ly/Matt17:5); [26:63](https://ref.ly/Matt26:63); [27:54](https://ref.ly/Matt27:54); [28:19](https://ref.ly/Matt28:19)). In his unique relationship to the Father, Jesus accomplishes salvation as the trusting and obedient Son. • who brings me great joy: God the Father confirmed his Son’s ministry with language from Isaiah ([Isa 42:1](https://ref.ly/Isa42:1)) and so prepared Israel for his ministry.

Jesus was led by the Spirit: The temptation was providentially arranged by God as a test of the Messiah’s character (see [Deut 8:2](https://ref.ly/Deut8:2)). • to be tempted there by the devil: This test of character, initiated by God (who tempts no one; see [Jas 1:13–14](https://ref.ly/Jas1:13-Jas1:14)), was accomplished through the devil’s own desire to lure Jesus into sin.

## Matthew 4:1–11 (id: 22150)

Parallels between Adam and Jesus are obvious in this account of Jesus’ temptation. Jesus is the second Adam (see [Rom 5:12–19](https://ref.ly/Rom5:12-Rom5:19)) and the second Israel ([Matt 2:15](https://ref.ly/Matt2:15)). In contrast to the ancient Israelites, he fulfilled Israel’s history by successfully wandering through the desert without sinning. He proved himself the obedient Son of God by defeating Satan in spiritual combat. And because he underwent temptation himself as a human, Jesus is able to sympathize with the temptations we face (see [Heb 2:14–18](https://ref.ly/Heb2:14-Heb2:18); [4:15](https://ref.ly/Heb4:15)) and help us overcome them as he did ([1 Cor 10:13](https://ref.ly/1Cor10:13)).

Satan, called the ruler of this world ([John 12:31](https://ref.ly/John12:31)), offered to hand over all the kingdoms of the world and their glory to Jesus to keep him from accomplishing the will of his Father. • Glory refers to political power and dominion (e.g., [Matt 6:29](https://ref.ly/Matt6:29)). Satan’s strategy was to get Jesus to abuse his sonship, thus diverting him from the path of suffering and obedience that climaxed at the cross.

John had been arrested by Herod Antipas (see [14:1–12](https://ref.ly/Matt14:1-Matt14:12)). Antipas was tetrarch of Galilee and Perea, where John was probably working at the time. • When Jesus heard … he left Judea (near Perea, where John was arrested) and returned to Galilee: Jesus withdrew to avoid martyrdom before finishing his work of revealing the Kingdom. As in Joseph’s flight to Nazareth ([2:22–23](https://ref.ly/Matt2:22-Matt2:23)), an escape from danger can also be God’s providential direction and the fulfillment of prophecy ([4:14–16](https://ref.ly/Matt4:14-Matt4:16)).

Many Judeans considered Galileans to be uncultured, with a lazy command of the language (cp.

The Messiah’s ministry has three main features: teaching*,* announcing … the Kingdom*,* and healing. • The synagogues were centers for prayer, study, and exposition of Scripture and tradition. They were the social centers of many Jewish villages. The hypocrisy and hostility of the Jewish leaders was evident at the synagogues ([6:2](https://ref.ly/Matt6:2), [5](https://ref.ly/Matt6:5); [10:17](https://ref.ly/Matt10:17); [12:9–14](https://ref.ly/Matt12:9-Matt12:14); [13:54](https://ref.ly/Matt13:54); [23:6](https://ref.ly/Matt23:6), [34](https://ref.ly/Matt23:34)). • Announcing the Good News means presenting the message about the Kingdom of Heaven ([9:35](https://ref.ly/Matt9:35); [24:14](https://ref.ly/Matt24:14); [26:13](https://ref.ly/Matt26:13); also [Mark 1:1](https://ref.ly/Mark1:1); [Rom 1:16](https://ref.ly/Rom1:16)).

During Jesus’ day, much of Palestine was in the Roman jurisdiction of Syria (a term that could refer to the entire eastern shore of the Mediterranean).

In [17:15](https://ref.ly/Matt17:15), one so described “falls into fire and water,” that is, the boy was unable to control himself. • The Ten Towns was a federation of ten cities, most of which were east of the Jordan and southeast of the Sea of Galilee (Damascus, Raphana, Hippos, Abila \[or Canatha], Gadara, Scythopolis, Pella, Dion, Gerasa, and Philadelphia \[Amman]).

The theme of the Sermon on the Mount is the Messiah’s call to righteousness. Paul understood righteousness in terms of God’s saving acts and of a person’s standing before God. Jesus uses the term for moral behavior that conforms to God’s will, as James does. Specifically, righteousness is doing the will of God as Jesus reveals it. This “revelation of righteousness” unifies the entire Sermon.

poor and realize their need for him (literally *poor in spirit*; cp. [Luke 6:20](https://ref.ly/Luke6:20), [24](https://ref.ly/Luke6:24)): In the Old Testament, the poor are often depicted as especially pious because oppression by the wealthy leads them to trust in the Lord for salvation and deliverance rather than relying on the power of wealth ([Matt 11:5](https://ref.ly/Matt11:5); [Pss 37:14–15](https://ref.ly/Ps37:14-Ps37:15); [40:17](https://ref.ly/Ps40:17); [69:28–33](https://ref.ly/Ps69:28-Ps69:33); [Isa 61:1](https://ref.ly/Isa61:1); [66:2](https://ref.ly/Isa66:2)). In both Matthew’s and Luke’s accounts, the “poor” are indeed physically poor, but their trust in God, not their poverty, is what makes them blessed ([Isa 57:15](https://ref.ly/Isa57:15); [66:2](https://ref.ly/Isa66:2)).

Those who mourn were those who lamented the spiritual and national condition of Israel (see [23:37–39](https://ref.ly/Matt23:37-Matt23:39); [Isa 61:2–3](https://ref.ly/Isa61:2-Isa61:3); [Joel 1:8–13](https://ref.ly/Joel1:8-Joel1:13); [2:12–13](https://ref.ly/Joel2:12-Joel2:13), [18–19](https://ref.ly/Joel2:18-Joel2:19); [Rom 9:1–5](https://ref.ly/Rom9:1-Rom9:5); [1 Cor 5:2](https://ref.ly/1Cor5:2); [Jas 4:9](https://ref.ly/Jas4:9)).

Comfort will accompany the fulfillment of all that God has promised ([Isa 40:1–2](https://ref.ly/Isa40:1-Isa40:2); [61:2–3](https://ref.ly/Isa61:2-Isa61:3)).

those who are humble: See [Ps 37:11](https://ref.ly/Ps37:11), which Jesus practically quotes here. Elsewhere, Jesus describes himself in similar terms—in contrast to other teachers ([Matt 11:29](https://ref.ly/Matt11:29)) and as one who shuns pride ([12:17–21](https://ref.ly/Matt12:17-Matt12:21); [21:5](https://ref.ly/Matt21:5)). This trait of Jesus is exemplified in his death on the cross ([1 Pet 2:23](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:23); [3:9](https://ref.ly/1Pet3:9)). • The whole earth could also be rendered *the land*, thus referring to God’s promise of land to Abraham and his descendants ([Gen 12:7](https://ref.ly/Gen12:7); [17:8](https://ref.ly/Gen17:8); see [Isa 60:21](https://ref.ly/Isa60:21)). A wider sense may also be intended, such as God’s reign over the entire earth ([Matt 19:28](https://ref.ly/Matt19:28); [28:18–20](https://ref.ly/Matt28:18-Matt28:20); [Ps 115:16](https://ref.ly/Ps115:16)).

Abolish would mean to eliminate and replace the law of Moses and the writings of the prophets (i.e., the whole Old Testament) as the revelation of God’s will. • Accomplish their purpose might mean to obey them perfectly, to complete their teaching, or to bring about the fulfillment of their prophecies (see [1:22](https://ref.ly/Matt1:22); [2:15](https://ref.ly/Matt2:15), [17](https://ref.ly/Matt2:17), [23](https://ref.ly/Matt2:23)). Jesus himself is the realization of all that both the Prophets and the Law taught and expected. Now that Christ, the fulfillment, has come, the Old Testament must be understood in light of him ([Luke 24:26](https://ref.ly/Luke24:26), [44](https://ref.ly/Luke24:44)).

The realization of the law in Christ means that obedience to all of his commands (see [28:20](https://ref.ly/Matt28:20)) is the only acceptable response for his disciples. • Commandment refers to the Old Testament commands ([5:18](https://ref.ly/Matt5:18)) as now fulfilled in Christ’s teaching (see [5:21–48](https://ref.ly/Matt5:21-Matt5:48)). • the least in the Kingdom of Heaven: Jesus may mean that such an individual will enter the Kingdom, but only barely and with low status; alternatively, some Jewish evidence suggests that he is referring to damnation (cp. [8:12](https://ref.ly/Matt8:12), where “those for whom the Kingdom was prepared” are eternally excluded).

unless your righteousness is better: Jesus’ disciples must have the substantially new kind of righteousness that Jesus teaches and makes possible (illustrated in [5:21–47](https://ref.ly/Matt5:21-Matt5:47) and summed up in [5:48](https://ref.ly/Matt5:48)); it is both quantitatively and qualitatively distinct. Just as Jesus is greater than the Temple ([12:6](https://ref.ly/Matt12:6)) and Jonah ([12:41](https://ref.ly/Matt12:41)), so the righteousness of his followers far outstrips that of the teachers of religious law and the Pharisees (see [3:7–9](https://ref.ly/Matt3:7-Matt3:9)).

It demands people to live in peace with each other ([Matthew 5:23–24](https://ref.ly/Matt5:23-Matt5:24)). It is not enough to only avoid committing murder ([5:22](https://ref.ly/Matt5:22)).

They did not tolerate unreconciled relationships or any devaluation of others. • If you call someone an idiot: The Aramaic term reqa’ (transliterated as raca) means something like “empty head,” and the clause probably means the same as if you curse someone (literally *if you say, ‘You fool’*; cp.

hell (Greek *Gehenna*): Gehenna originally referred to a valley outside Jerusalem where some of the kings of Judah worshiped idols and performed human sacrifice by fire ([2 Chr 28:3](https://ref.ly/2Chr28:3); [33:6](https://ref.ly/2Chr33:6); [Jer 7:31](https://ref.ly/Jer7:31); [32:35](https://ref.ly/Jer32:35)). The site was eventually destroyed by Josiah ([2 Kgs 23:10](https://ref.ly/2Kgs23:10)). In the New Testament, Gehenna describes the place of punishment by God. Unless disciples have surpassing righteousness, they will not enter the Kingdom ([Matt 5:20](https://ref.ly/Matt5:20)) but will be punished eternally ([5:22](https://ref.ly/Matt5:22); [23:33](https://ref.ly/Matt23:33)).

A notice of divorce is a document stating the legality of a divorce. Evidence suggests that such a document permitted remarriage. “The essential formula in the notice of divorce is, ‘Lo, you are free to marry any man.’ … The essential formula in a writ of emancipation is, ‘Lo, you are a freedwoman: lo, you belong to yourself’” (*Mishnah Gittin* 9:3\).

Jesus challenges the misapplication of the Old Testament provision for divorce (see [Deut 24:1–4](https://ref.ly/Deut24:1-Deut24:4); cp. [Matt 19:3–9](https://ref.ly/Matt19:3-Matt19:9)): Following the rules does not make divorce acceptable. Jesus allows only one legitimate reason for divorce, sexual infidelity, and forbids casual divorce (see also [1 Cor 7:10–11](https://ref.ly/1Cor7:10-1Cor7:11)).

The exception clause permits but does not demand divorce when one partner has been unfaithful (see also [19:9](https://ref.ly/Matt19:9)). Notably, Jesus does not demand death for the guilty party (see [Deut 22:21–22](https://ref.ly/Deut22:21-Deut22:22)). • The implication seems to be that by divorcing his wife for illegitimate reasons, the man causes her to commit adultery by wrongly putting her in a situation where she remarries and so breaks the law. • anyone who marries a divorced woman: It is not clear whether Jesus is referring to any woman who is divorced, regardless of the reason, or only to a woman who is divorced without an acceptable reason (unfaithfulness). The underlying assumption in Jewish divorce law was simple: Legitimate divorces permitted remarriage.

Jesus here summarizes the Old Testament teaching on oaths ([Lev 19:12](https://ref.ly/Lev19:12); [Num 30:2–4](https://ref.ly/Num30:2-Num30:4); [Deut 23:21–23](https://ref.ly/Deut23:21-Deut23:23); [Ps 50:14](https://ref.ly/Ps50:14); [Zech 8:17](https://ref.ly/Zech8:17)). The Pharisees had degrees of commitment for oaths—for example, ones that did not mention God were not as binding. Jesus shows that because God is related to all things (heaven*,* earth*,* Jerusalem*,* my head; see also [Matt 23:16–22](https://ref.ly/Matt23:16-Matt23:22)), breaking any oath breaks God’s command (see [Exod 20:7](https://ref.ly/Exod20:7)). The point is that one must be altogether truthful. Jesus’ righteousness elevates the disciple’s everyday yes and no to the level of binding oath. Oaths become superfluous to the honest person ([Jas 5:12](https://ref.ly/Jas5:12)).

The Old Testament permitted proportionate retribution ([Exod 21:24–25](https://ref.ly/Exod21:24-Exod21:25); [Deut 19:16–21](https://ref.ly/Deut19:16-Deut19:21)), which was to prevent punishments from far exceeding the severity of the offense. Jesus, however, does not permit personal retaliation at all among his followers. Jesus’ way is not to insist on justice but to find victory through suffering and the cross ([1 Pet 2:23](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:23)). Some have taken this passage as a guide for all of life (including politics). Others understand it merely as the willingness to forgo one’s personal rights and to forgive as God has forgiven (see [Matt 5:48](https://ref.ly/Matt5:48); [18:23–35](https://ref.ly/Matt18:23-Matt18:35)). Like the servant in [Isa 50:4–9](https://ref.ly/Isa50:4-Isa50:9) and [53:7](https://ref.ly/Isa53:7) (see also [Matt 12:15–21](https://ref.ly/Matt12:15-Matt12:21)), Jesus’ followers are to apply the same virtue to honor, possessions, time, or property. Righteousness does not insist on its own way.

At the same time, Jesus calls for people to stop oppressively controlling others in the name of pastoral concern. The judgment Jesus prohibits often involves rigorous scrutiny of trivial matters (see [23:23–24](https://ref.ly/Matt23:23-Matt23:24)).

The mysteries of the Kingdom ([13:11](https://ref.ly/Matt13:11)) are holy (see [Exod 29:33](https://ref.ly/Exod29:33); [Lev 2:3](https://ref.ly/Lev2:3); [22:10–16](https://ref.ly/Lev22:10-Lev22:16); [Num 18:8–10](https://ref.ly/Num18:8-Num18:10)). • Don’t waste what is holy on people who are unholy: Literally *Don’t give the sacred to dogs.* Jews often referred to Gentiles as dogs (see [Matt 15:26](https://ref.ly/Matt15:26); see [Ps 22:16](https://ref.ly/Ps22:16), [20](https://ref.ly/Ps22:20)) or pigs because those animals were unclean ([Lev 11](https://ref.ly/Lev11:1-Lev11:47)). Some interpreters understand this statement as warning that the message of the Kingdom would not be well received by many Gentiles. Others see it as a warning about offering the message of the Kingdom to the resistant Jewish leaders (see [Matt 5:20](https://ref.ly/Matt5:20); [10:11–14](https://ref.ly/Matt10:11-Matt10:14); see also [Heb 10:29](https://ref.ly/Heb10:29)) or to unbelievers in general (see [Matt 18:17](https://ref.ly/Matt18:17); see also [1 Cor 2:13–16](https://ref.ly/1Cor2:13-1Cor2:16); [2 Pet 2:21–22](https://ref.ly/2Pet2:21-2Pet2:22)).

False prophets speak what people want to hear rather than calling people to live according to God’s will. [Deuteronomy 13:1–5](https://ref.ly/Deut13:1-Deut13:5) and [18:21–22](https://ref.ly/Matt18:21-Matt18:22) set standards for evaluating a prophet’s truthfulness: His words must conform to God’s word, and his predictions must come true. Jesus unpacks the first requirement: A prophet’s actions must match his words in order to be believable; accordingly, a true prophet’s actions will also match God’s word. Just as the fruit indicates the nature of a tree*,* so one’s life indicates either a regenerate or unregenerate heart. False prophets are expected at the end of the age (see [Matt 24:11](https://ref.ly/Matt24:11), [24](https://ref.ly/Matt24:24); [Acts 20:28–35](https://ref.ly/Acts20:28-Acts20:35); [Rev 13:11–18](https://ref.ly/Rev13:11-Rev13:18); [16:13](https://ref.ly/Rev16:13); [19:20](https://ref.ly/Rev19:20); [20:10](https://ref.ly/Rev20:10)).

In Jesus’ teaching, this day is when all will be judged for their response to him (see [Matt 10:15](https://ref.ly/Matt10:15); [11:20–24](https://ref.ly/Matt11:20-Matt11:24); [12:36](https://ref.ly/Matt12:36); [24:19–50](https://ref.ly/Matt24:19-Matt24:50); [25:13](https://ref.ly/Matt25:13), [31–46](https://ref.ly/Matt25:31-Matt25:46); [Acts 17:31](https://ref.ly/Acts17:31); [Rom 2:16](https://ref.ly/Rom2:16)). • Neither charismatic gifts nor public accomplishments in Jesus’ name will necessarily bring God’s acceptance; the decisive issue is obedience ([Matt 7:21](https://ref.ly/Matt7:21)).

The Jewish people despised Jewish tax collectors ([5:46–47](https://ref.ly/Matt5:46-Matt5:47); [18:15–20](https://ref.ly/Matt18:15-Matt18:20)), who cooperated with Roman oppressors and were considered betrayers of the Israelite nation. Many also considered them unclean because of their frequent contact with Gentiles and because of the idolatrous images on Roman coins. Tax\-collection was a private enterprise. In each district, Rome granted the right to collect taxes to the highest bidder (cp. [Luke 19:1–10](https://ref.ly/Luke19:1-Luke19:10)). Anything collected above the bid was profit for the collectors, who, driven by greed, often used extortion.

I want you to show mercy, not offer sacrifices: God’s desire is applied to the question of table fellowship with sinners; Jesus’ mercy in eating with sinners contrasts with the Pharisees’ separation from sinners (symbolized as sacrifices). • Jesus revealed the true spiritual condition of the Pharisees, who think they are righteous*;* they failed to recognize that they were in fact unrighteous and in need of the Messiah’s salvation.

fast: Fasting expressed personal humility and repentance ([2 Sam 12:16–23](https://ref.ly/2Sam12:16-2Sam12:23); [Dan 9:3](https://ref.ly/Dan9:3)). It called attention to the national need for repentance ([Lev 16:29–31](https://ref.ly/Lev16:29-Lev16:31); [Neh 9:1](https://ref.ly/Neh9:1)) and probably sought to hasten the arrival of the Messiah through purification. The fact that Jesus and his disciples did not fast ([Matt 11:18–19](https://ref.ly/Matt11:18-Matt11:19)) subtly proclaimed that the Messiah had already arrived (see also [6:16](https://ref.ly/Matt6:16)).

Jesus called his twelve disciples as workers in the harvest ([9:37–38](https://ref.ly/Matt9:37-Matt9:38)). The choice of twelve is not accidental—it recalls the twelve tribes of Israel. Jesus was appointing new leaders for the new people of God under his reign as Messiah ([16:18–19](https://ref.ly/Matt16:18-Matt16:19); [18:18](https://ref.ly/Matt18:18); [19:28](https://ref.ly/Matt19:28); [21:43](https://ref.ly/Matt21:43)). • gave them authority ([9:6–8](https://ref.ly/Matt9:6-Matt9:8); [28:18](https://ref.ly/Matt28:18)): Jesus enabled the Twelve to perform ministries that the Jewish leaders could not accomplish ([9:32–34](https://ref.ly/Matt9:32-Matt9:34); [10:5–8](https://ref.ly/Matt10:5-Matt10:8)).

shake its dust from your feet: This prophet\-like gesture is explained by the Israelite custom of expressing displeasure with ungodliness by shaking off Gentile dust whenever crossing the border into Israel.

Now, with a more complete revelation in Jesus Christ, a town that rejected the disciples’ preaching would receive a more complete judgment. • such a town: An entire village or city is culpable when a significant majority rejects the message (see [Acts 13:45–47](https://ref.ly/Acts13:45-Acts13:47), [50–51](https://ref.ly/Acts13:50-Acts13:51); [14:1–7](https://ref.ly/Acts14:1-Acts14:7)).

## Matthew 10:32–33 (id: 21670)

God accepts the one who acknowledges Jesus publicly in the context of trial and persecution ([10:16–25](https://ref.ly/Matt10:16-Matt10:25)). These verses pertain to a person’s pattern of life (see [7:13–27](https://ref.ly/Matt7:13-Matt7:27)) and not to a single confession or a single denial. For example, Judas acknowledged Jesus in individual instances yet was damned ([26:23–24](https://ref.ly/Matt26:23-Matt26:24)), whereas Peter denied Jesus (see [26:69–75](https://ref.ly/Matt26:69-Matt26:75)) yet was saved.

If negative, it might refer to those who imprisoned John (see [Matt 11:2](https://ref.ly/Matt11:2); [14:1–12](https://ref.ly/Matt14:1-Matt14:12)), and *attacking* might mean either that they were trying to attack the Kingdom but were unable to thwart God’s sovereign plans, or that they were attacking it by persecuting its members.

A yoke, which forms a harness between two animals, is a metaphor for the demands of discipleship. In contrast to the “yoke” of the religious leaders, Jesus’ yoke is easy and light, not because it is less demanding (see [7:13–14](https://ref.ly/Matt7:13-Matt7:14)), but because the power of the Messiah (by the Holy Spirit) makes it possible (see [Acts 15:10](https://ref.ly/Acts15:10); [1 Jn 5:3](https://ref.ly/1John5:3)). The religious demands of Israel’s spiritual leaders ([Matt 23:4](https://ref.ly/Matt23:4); [Acts 15:10](https://ref.ly/Acts15:10)) included 613 Old Testament commands and their expansion through tradition. Jesus urged those who were suffering from the burdens of the Pharisees’ stipulations to come to him ([Matt 11:28](https://ref.ly/Matt11:28)) in order to find the salvation their hearts desired. It is a call to salvation involving a life of obedience to Jesus’ new teachings. People are invited to enter a relationship with a humble and gentle teacher.

Those who are true members in Jesus’ family do the will of the Father*,* as expressed in the commands of Jesus (see [7:21](https://ref.ly/Matt7:21)).

Jesus spoke of competing demands in life, (see also [8:18–22](https://ref.ly/Matt8:18-Matt8:22)). The worries of this life can become so great that they divert one from the path of faithful obedience (see [6:19–34](https://ref.ly/Matt6:19-Matt6:34)).

The phrase upon this rock is a pun on Peter’s name. Peter was the foundational rock in that he was the first confessor and leader of the apostles—he was the “founding member” of the church (see [Eph 2:20–22](https://ref.ly/Eph2:20-Eph2:22); [Rev 21:14](https://ref.ly/Rev21:14)). Some scholars have suggested that Jesus was referring to himself when he said this rock*,* but it seems clear that Jesus was referring either to Peter or to his confession. However, it is clearly Jesus’ church (my church), not Peter’s, and Jesus himself will build it. So it is not necessary to conclude that later church leaders must derive their authority from Peter. • Matthew is the only Gospel writer who uses the term church (also [Matt 18:17](https://ref.ly/Matt18:17)).

About that time: Matthew connects the disciples’ questions with the previous discussion concerning the Temple. The disciples began to assume that their new freedom in relation to Jewish authority entitled them to authority of their own. In addition, talk of special revelations ([11:25–27](https://ref.ly/Matt11:25-Matt11:27); [13:11–17](https://ref.ly/Matt13:11-Matt13:17)) and roles of leadership ([10:2–4](https://ref.ly/Matt10:2-Matt10:4); [19:28](https://ref.ly/Matt19:28)) probably gave rise to jealous comparisons and petty desires for power among the disciples, perhaps revolving around the apparent privilege of Peter ([17:25](https://ref.ly/Matt17:25)) or Peter, James, and John ([17:1–3](https://ref.ly/Matt17:1-Matt17:3)).

## Matthew 18:1–35 (id: 21832)

This fourth major discourse in Matthew (see study note on Matt 5:1–7:29) focuses on responses to the Messiah—acceptance by the disciples and rejection by the Jewish leaders and most of the populace. In light of this growing polarization, Jesus began to instruct his followers on the nature of community life. For a community to live according to Jesus’ standards, it must live with humility ([18:1–5](https://ref.ly/Matt18:1-Matt18:5)), sensitivity ([18:6–9](https://ref.ly/Matt18:6-Matt18:9)), compassion ([18:10–14](https://ref.ly/Matt18:10-Matt18:14)), discipline ([18:15–18](https://ref.ly/Matt18:15-Matt18:18)), and forgiveness ([18:21–35](https://ref.ly/Matt18:21-Matt18:35)). As with the other discourses, a concluding formula ([19:1–2](https://ref.ly/Matt19:1-Matt19:2)) bridges to the next section.

The church is the local Christian community. • The unrepentant person is to be considered a pagan or a corrupt tax collector, a wicked transgressor of the law. Church discipline by exclusion (excommunication; see [Acts 5:1–6](https://ref.ly/Acts5:1-Acts5:6); [Rom 16:17](https://ref.ly/Rom16:17); [1 Cor 5:1–13](https://ref.ly/1Cor5:1-1Cor5:13); [2 Cor 6:14–18](https://ref.ly/2Cor6:14-2Cor6:18); [Gal 5:7–12](https://ref.ly/Gal5:7-Gal5:12); [2 Thes 3:14–15](https://ref.ly/2Thess3:14-2Thess3:15)) is rooted in the conviction that God’s people are to be holy and that sin corrupts fellowship, both between people and between the people and God. The goal is neither vindictive retribution nor a public display of power, but restoration of the wayward to holiness and fellowship ([Matt 18:10–15](https://ref.ly/Matt18:10-Matt18:15); [Gal 6:1](https://ref.ly/Gal6:1); [Jas 5:19–20](https://ref.ly/Jas5:19-Jas5:20)).

There were two divergent views on when one was allowed to divorce one’s wife.

why did Moses say (literally *command*): The Pharisees thought Jesus had contradicted a command of the law (see [Deut 24:1–4](https://ref.ly/Deut24:1-Deut24:4)), but Moses permitted divorce only as a concession to their hard hearts. Jesus introduced the revolutionary principle that God’s permission is not necessarily his desire (see [1 Cor 6:12](https://ref.ly/1Cor6:12)). Divorce is never God’s desire ([Mal 2:14–16](https://ref.ly/Mal2:14-Mal2:16)); it is an expression of human sin.

Jesus permits only one legitimate reason for a man to divorce: if his wife has been unfaithful (see [5:32](https://ref.ly/Matt5:32)). In the face of those who thought divorce could be taken lightly, Jesus affirms God’s created order: Marriage was designed to be permanent (see [Mark 10:11–12](https://ref.ly/Mark10:11-Mark10:12)). • commits adultery: This speaks only of the man who divorces his wife unlawfully.

The man’s questions (also [19:20](https://ref.ly/Matt19:20)) show that he was not trusting in the adequacy of God’s revealed will. • only One … is good: The man may have believed he could act with perfect goodness on his own, whereas only God is truly good and thus the source of all goodness. • keep the commandments: Jesus has in mind either leading the man to see his sinfulness by asking him to do the impossible, or more probably, restating that good works are a telling gauge of the truthfulness of a person’s faith (see [7:13–27](https://ref.ly/Matt7:13-Matt7:27)).

What sorrow awaits you: A stark warning of judgment from God. • Hypocrites! In English, hypocrisy describes a contradiction between reality and appearance. But in biblical usage, hypocrisy is misperceiving God’s will, leading people astray, and thus incurring God’s judgment. Coupled with this is often a desire for prestige and power ([23:5–12](https://ref.ly/Matt23:5-Matt23:12)), abuse of teaching authority, false teachings on doctrine or practice ([23:13–22](https://ref.ly/Matt23:13-Matt23:22)), and preoccupation with ethical minutiae ([23:23–28](https://ref.ly/Matt23:23-Matt23:28)). An accurate English term for this combination of factors is *heresy*. The Pharisees and teachers of religious law displayed all of these characteristics. As the Christian church began to grow, these characteristics continued to appear (e.g., [1 Tim 4:1–3](https://ref.ly/1Tim4:1-1Tim4:3); [2 Pet 2:1–22](https://ref.ly/2Pet2:1-2Pet2:22)), so God’s children always need to guard against them ([Jas 4:7–10](https://ref.ly/Jas4:7-Jas4:10); [1 Pet 2:1–3](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:1-1Pet2:3)). • shut the door of the Kingdom: By their false teaching and opposition to Jesus (see [Matt 9:32–34](https://ref.ly/Matt9:32-Matt9:34); [12:22–37](https://ref.ly/Matt12:22-Matt12:37); [15:12–14](https://ref.ly/Matt15:12-Matt15:14); [21:15](https://ref.ly/Matt21:15); [John 9:13–34](https://ref.ly/John9:13-John9:34)), the teachers of religious law and Pharisees prevented others from hearing and believing the truth about the Messiah.

A convert (proselyte) made a full conversion to Judaism, performing such observances as baptism, sacrifice, and circumcision (see [Acts 13:43](https://ref.ly/Acts13:43)). A convert was thus distinct from a “God\-fearer,” who adopted certain Jewish beliefs, most notably monotheism, without fully converting to Judaism (see [Luke 7:4–5](https://ref.ly/Luke7:4-Luke7:5); [Acts 10:2](https://ref.ly/Acts10:2)). It is likely that to make one convert means to persuade God\-fearers to become full converts to Judaism by undergoing circumcision (cp.

the sun will be darkened … will be shaken: This phenomenon can be taken literally, as befitting the climactic self\-disclosure of God’s Son, or metaphorically, as for a cosmically significant event (see [Acts 2:17–21](https://ref.ly/Acts2:17-Acts2:21); [Heb 12:26–27](https://ref.ly/Heb12:26-Heb12:27); [2 Pet 3:10](https://ref.ly/2Pet3:10); [Rev 6:12–13](https://ref.ly/Rev6:12-Rev6:13)). Similar apocalyptic language is used frequently in the Old Testament for describing political disasters and the collapse of a government as cosmic judgments from God (e.g., [Isa 13:9–16](https://ref.ly/Isa13:9-Isa13:16); [Ezek 32:1–10](https://ref.ly/Ezek32:1-Ezek32:10); [Joel 2:1–17](https://ref.ly/Joel2:1-Joel2:17); [Amos 8:7–10](https://ref.ly/Amos8:7-Amos8:10)).

These sayings form the climax of the discourse and answer the second of the disciples’ initial questions (see [24:3](https://ref.ly/Matt24:3)). Some take [24:29–31](https://ref.ly/Matt24:29-Matt24:31) to refer to God’s judgment on the Jewish people in AD 70, using apocalyptic images and metaphors to describe it. Others see a reference to the second coming of Christ at the end of history.

the sign that the Son of Man is coming (literally *the sign of the Son of Man*): The sign is probably the Son of Man himself (see [12:38–42](https://ref.ly/Matt12:38-Matt12:42); [16:4](https://ref.ly/Matt16:4)). His coming expresses his vindication (see [26:64](https://ref.ly/Matt26:64)) and will bring deep mourning to those who experience God’s judgment. • All the peoples of the earth could be translated *all the tribes of the land.* The term used here is not the usual Greek term for Gentile nations (ethnoi), but a term used frequently of the tribes (phulai) of Israel (*the land*), suggesting that a national disaster in Israel might be in view (see [21:43](https://ref.ly/Matt21:43); [Zech 12:10–14](https://ref.ly/Zech12:10-Zech12:14)). • the Son of Man coming on the clouds: See [Dan 7:13](https://ref.ly/Dan7:13). Many believe that this means a descent of the Son of Man from God’s presence to reside on earth as Judge and Deliverer—i.e., the second coming of Christ. Others have argued that this describes the Son of Man coming in judgment, but not necessarily the second coming of Christ (see [Matt 10:23](https://ref.ly/Matt10:23); [16:27](https://ref.ly/Matt16:27); [19:28](https://ref.ly/Matt19:28); [25:31](https://ref.ly/Matt25:31); [26:64](https://ref.ly/Matt26:64); [28:18](https://ref.ly/Matt28:18)).

To meet the bridegroom is an image for the coming of the Messiah (see [Mark 2:19–20](https://ref.ly/Mark2:19-Mark2:20)). • Details of wedding customs during the period are not known. Some think that the bride was led to the home of the bridegroom, who would stay away until the time appointed for the wedding feast. The bridesmaids*,* who had already escorted the bride to the groom’s home, would then wait for news of his arrival and escort him to the feast ([Matt 25:10](https://ref.ly/Matt25:10)). Others think the groom may have come late in the night to the bride’s home, where he was announced. Then, after celebrating with the bride’s guests, the groom would take his bride under torches or lamps to his home.

The Greek term translated eternal can mean either “lasting forever” or “lasting for an age,” in this case “the age to come” ([13:39–40](https://ref.ly/Matt13:39-Matt13:40), [49](https://ref.ly/Matt13:49); [24:3](https://ref.ly/Matt24:3); [John 17:3](https://ref.ly/John17:3); [2 Thes 1:9](https://ref.ly/2Thess1:9); [Phlm 1:15](https://ref.ly/Phlm1:15); [1 Jn 5:11](https://ref.ly/1John5:11), [13](https://ref.ly/1John5:13)). Some hold out hope that the punishment of the damned will, after “an age,” be ended by annihilation or forgiveness. The parallel between eternal life and eternal punishment suggests strongly that it means “lasting forever,” since eternal life does not end (see also [Luke 16:19–31](https://ref.ly/Luke16:19-Luke16:31); [Heb 6:2](https://ref.ly/Heb6:2); [Rev 20:10](https://ref.ly/Rev20:10)).

It is also possible that he was motivated by disappointment over the nature of Jesus’ reign as Messiah, his own humiliation over the anointing of Jesus (see [John 12:1–8](https://ref.ly/John12:1-John12:8)), or resentment over the leadership of the Galilean apostles, Peter, James, and John. Whatever his motivation, Judas’s betrayal was a part of God’s sovereign plan ([Acts 1:16–17](https://ref.ly/Acts1:16-Acts1:17)).

The Last Supper derives its significance in part from the Jewish Passover (see [Exod 12](https://ref.ly/Exod12:1-Exod12:51)). The phases of the Jewish liturgy for Passover are as follows: (1\) Festal blessing; (2\) first cup (see [Luke 22:17–18](https://ref.ly/Luke22:17-Luke22:18)); (3\) eating bitter herbs (see [Matt 26:23](https://ref.ly/Matt26:23) and corresponding study note); (4\) eating unleavened bread ([26:26](https://ref.ly/Matt26:26); [Mark 14:22](https://ref.ly/Mark14:22)); (5\) second cup is mixed; (6\) the Passover *haggadah* (reading) is given ([Exod 12](https://ref.ly/Exod12:1-Exod12:51)); (7\) first part of the *hallel* ([Pss 113–114](https://ref.ly/Ps113:1-Ps114:8); see study note on Pss 113–118); (8\) second cup is taken; (9\) blessing and eating of unleavened bread ([Matt 26:26](https://ref.ly/Matt26:26); [Mark 14:22](https://ref.ly/Mark14:22); [Luke 22:19](https://ref.ly/Luke22:19)); (10\) the Passover lamb is eaten; (11\) third cup ([Matt 26:27–28](https://ref.ly/Matt26:27-Matt26:28); [Mark 14:23–24](https://ref.ly/Mark14:23-Mark14:24); [Luke 22:20](https://ref.ly/Luke22:20)); (12\) fourth cup (see [Matt 26:29](https://ref.ly/Matt26:29)\[?]; [Mark 14:25](https://ref.ly/Mark14:25)\[?]); (13\) time of fellowship; (14\) second part of the *hallel* ([Pss 115–118](https://ref.ly/Ps115:1-Ps118:29); see [Matt 26:30](https://ref.ly/Matt26:30)). None of the New Testament accounts of the Last Supper includes every aspect of a typical Jewish Passover. However, the most important aspects of the Passover that gave meaning to the early Christian celebration of the Lord’s Supper are included (see [1 Cor 11:23–25](https://ref.ly/1Cor11:23-1Cor11:25)). Jesus, the Lamb of God, is the ultimate Passover lamb and the perfect sacrifice for sin. • this is my body … my blood: Ever since the Reformation, there have been three dominant interpretations of Jesus’ statements concerning the bread and the wine: (1\) that the bread and wine change into the actual body and blood of Jesus Christ (*transubstantiation*); (2\) that Christ is mysteriously present in the sacrament either spiritually (*real presence*) or “in, with, and under” the bread and wine (*consubstantiation*); (3\) that the bread and wine symbolize the body and blood of Christ, benefiting the recipient through the Spirit by faith (*symbolism*).

He gave thanks. The traditional blessing for the Passover cup was “Blessed are you, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who creates the fruit of the vine.” An early Christian variant is, “We give thanks to you, our Father, for the Holy Vine of David, your child, whom you made known to us through Jesus your child; glory be to you forever” (*Didache* 9\.2\). • The four cups of the Passover meal correspond to the fourfold promise of [Exod 6:6–7](https://ref.ly/Exod6:6-Exod6:7), with two for deliverance, one for redemption (see [Matt 26:27–28](https://ref.ly/Matt26:27-Matt26:28)), and one for fellowship (see [26:29](https://ref.ly/Matt26:29)).

The blood of Jesus, the sinless Lamb of God, establishes a new covenant (see [Jer 31:31](https://ref.ly/Jer31:31)). The idea of the *covenant* is God’s unilateral commitment to establish salvation for mankind, fulfilling the promise to Abraham (see [Gen 12](https://ref.ly/Gen12:1-Gen12:20); [Gal 3:15–29](https://ref.ly/Gal3:15-Gal3:29); [4:12–31](https://ref.ly/Gal4:12-Gal4:31)). • to forgive the sins of many: Jesus shed his blood as a sacrifice for sin (see [Jer 31:31–34](https://ref.ly/Jer31:31-Jer31:34); [Mark 14:24](https://ref.ly/Mark14:24)).

Or, Matthew might have thought of similar passages in Jeremiah ([Jer 19:1–13](https://ref.ly/Jer19:1-Jer19:13); [18:2–6](https://ref.ly/Jer18:2-Jer18:6); [32:6–15](https://ref.ly/Jer32:6-Jer32:15)) along with [Zech 11:12–13](https://ref.ly/Zech11:12-Zech11:13). • Matthew sees a striking resemblance between Zechariah’s actions and those of the leading priests. Both contexts deal with the rejection of God’s messenger who was to be king of God’s people.

king of the Jews: The Sanhedrin’s original charge of blasphemy ([26:65–66](https://ref.ly/Matt26:65-Matt26:66); [27:1](https://ref.ly/Matt27:1)) held no interest to the Romans, who saw it as a Jewish religious question (cp. [Acts 25:18–20](https://ref.ly/Acts25:18-Acts25:20)). The charge was therefore changed to incriminate Jesus in Roman eyes as a political rebel (see [Luke 23:2](https://ref.ly/Luke23:2)).

However, if Pilate’s position with Caesar was precarious at this point (see study note on John 19:12; see Philo, *On the Embassy to Gaius* 159–161\), then this gesture may have been to keep the peace and thus avoid negative attention from Rome.

they … nailed him to the cross: Crucifixion, though not generally practiced by Jews, was a widespread Roman punishment for military and political offenders, particularly slaves, rebels, and insurrectionists. The sheer cruelty and the public spectacle of crucifixion worked as a powerful social deterrent. Victims were flogged and then crucified naked, adding to the humiliation. It was seen as the most painful of all possible deaths; it involved intense suffering, exposure to weather and insects, suffocation, and often a final violent thrust of a spear to end life. Further, since crucifixion was a curse from God ([Deut 21:22–23](https://ref.ly/Deut21:22-Deut21:23)), the act was particularly heinous to Jewish sensibilities. Paradoxically, what was so despicable among humans has become the instrument of our salvation. Jesus previously had instructed his disciples to take up their crosses and follow him ([Matt 16:24](https://ref.ly/Matt16:24)).

Death was lamented and mourned ([Mark 5:38–39](https://ref.ly/Mark5:38-Mark5:39)); the body was washed ([Acts 9:37](https://ref.ly/Acts9:37)), anointed ([Matt 26:6–13](https://ref.ly/Matt26:6-Matt26:13); [John 12:3](https://ref.ly/John12:3), [7](https://ref.ly/John12:7); [19:39](https://ref.ly/John19:39)), and wrapped in burial cloths ([Matt 27:59](https://ref.ly/Matt27:59); see [Gen 50:2–3](https://ref.ly/Gen50:2-Gen50:3)). The body was placed in a tomb (see [Matt 23:27](https://ref.ly/Matt23:27)) that had been tunneled into a rock or carved into the side of a cave wall.
