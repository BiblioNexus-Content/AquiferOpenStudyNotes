--------------------------------

## Matthew 1:1 (id: 21648)

* *a record of the ancestors*: This phrase introduces [1:1–17](https://ref.ly/Matt1:1-Matt1:17). A similar phrase appears in Genesis to start each section of that book.
* *Jesus … David … Abraham*: These names repeat in reverse order in the list of Jesus' ancestors. This is a literary form called *chiasm* (arrangement of elements in mirror\-image). Identifying Jesus as a descendant of David introduces him as the Messiah (see [Matthew 12:23](https://ref.ly/Matt12:23); [22:42–45](https://ref.ly/Matt22:42-Matt22:45)). The link to Abraham emphasizes God's promise to Israel and how the covenant (agreement) extends to include all nations (see [Matthew 28:16–20](https://ref.ly/Matt28:16-Matt28:20); [Genesis 12:3](https://ref.ly/Gen12:3)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 1:1

## Matthew 1:1–2.23 (id: 21640)

This story shows how certain parts of the life of Jesus fulfilled Old Testament prophecies. This includes: 

* his family history and birth (chapter [1](https://ref.ly/Matt1:1-Matt1:25)), and
* the places he lived as a child (chapter [2](https://ref.ly/Matt2:1-Matt2:23)).

The story also shows how efforts to stop the plan of God do not work ([2:1–15](https://ref.ly/Matt2:1-Matt2:15); see also [27:62–66](https://ref.ly/Matt27:62-Matt27:66)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 1:1–MAT 2:23

## Matthew 1:5 (id: 21653)

Rahab was a gentile prostitute who risked her life to hide the two spies of Joshua in Jericho ([Joshua 2:1–21](https://ref.ly/Josh2:1-Josh2:21)). Her place in the Messiah's family tree emphasizes the grace of God. She is praised for her faith in Israel's God and her good actions ([Hebrews 11:31](https://ref.ly/Heb11:31); [James 2:25](https://ref.ly/Jas2:25)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 1:5

## Matthew 1:7 (id: 21654)

*Asa* (Greek *Asaph*): this likely refers to the Old Testament king ([1 Kings 15:9–24](https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:9-1Kgs15:24); [1 Chronicles 3:10](https://ref.ly/1Chr3:10)) and not the psalmist Asaph ([1 Chronicles 6:39](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:39); [25:1–2](https://ref.ly/1Chr25:1-1Chr25:2); [Psalms 50](https://ref.ly/Ps50:1-Ps50:23), [73–83](https://ref.ly/Ps73:1-Ps83:18)). Matthew focuses on the family line from David to the Messiah.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 1:7

## Matthew 1:8 (id: 21655)

*father of* (or *ancestor of*): Here this term refers to multiple generations ([2 Chronicles 21:1–26:1](https://ref.ly/2Chr21:1-2Chr21:26)). The same is true for Josiah ([Matthew 1:11](https://ref.ly/Matt1:11)) and Shealtiel ([1:12](https://ref.ly/Matt1:12)). The family line skips Ahaziah, Joash, and Amaziah ([2 Kings 8:24](https://ref.ly/2Kgs8:24); [1 Chronicles 3:11](https://ref.ly/1Chr3:11); [2 Chronicles 22:1](https://ref.ly/2Chr22:1), [11](https://ref.ly/2Chr22:11); [24:27](https://ref.ly/2Chr24:27)). Perhaps this is because of their connection to Ahab and Jezebel.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 1:8

## Matthew 1:11 (id: 21641)

*father*: Josiah was Jehoiachin's grandfather.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 1:11

## Matthew 1:12 (id: 21643)

*Shealtiel*: Refer to [1 Chronicles 3:17–19](https://ref.ly/1Chr3:17-1Chr3:19) and [Ezra 3:2](https://ref.ly/Ezra3:2).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 1:12

## Matthew 1:12–16 (id: 21642)

The Old Testament is clearly the source for [Matthew 1:1–11](https://ref.ly/Matt1:1-Matt1:11). Matthew probably also used royal records and oral traditions for [1:12–16](https://ref.ly/Matt1:12-Matt1:16).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 1:12–MAT 1:16

## Matthew 1:16 (id: 21644)

This family history follows Joseph, who is part of the family line of King David (see also study note on Luke 3:23–38).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 1:16
* **Associated Articles:** Luke 3:23-38 (ID: `20936@TyndaleStudyNotes`)

## Matthew 1:17 (id: 21645)

Matthew says each time period has fourteen generations. But the first and third periods list only thirteen. A traditional Jewish and Old Testament method would count King David in both the first and second groups. It would include Jesus in the third group. 

This suggests Matthew is probably emphasizing the *gematria* (a system where letters represent numbers). The letters in the Hebrew word *dawid* (meaning "David") add up to fourteen. Matthew is emphasizing Jesus’ credentials as the Messiah ([1:1](https://ref.ly/Matt1:1)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 1:17

## Matthew 1:18 (id: 21646)

* *Jesus Christ* (literally *Jesus the Christ*)*:* *Christ* is not a personal name. *Christ* is a title that means "Messiah" or "God's chosen one."
* *pledged in marriage*: In Judaism, engagement (or betrothal) was a permanent relationship ([Malachi 2:14](https://ref.ly/Mal2:14)). It could only end through legal action. So, by law, Mary was Joseph’s wife and he was her husband (see [Matthew 1:20](https://ref.ly/Matt1:20); [Deuteronomy 22:23–24](https://ref.ly/Deut22:23-Deut22:24)). This was true even though they had not had sexual relations. Since Mary was a virgin when the Holy Spirit conceived Jesus, it proves Jesus’ divine nature.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 1:18

## Matthew 1:19 (id: 21647)

Joseph was a righteous man. This means he obeyed the law (see [Luke 1:6](https://ref.ly/Luke1:6)). He reconsidered marrying Mary because it appeared she had committed adultery. He could have cleared his name by publicly accusing Mary. This would have led to her trial and possible execution ([Deuteronomy 22:23–27](https://ref.ly/Deut22:23-Deut22:27); compare [Numbers 5:11–31](https://ref.ly/Num5:11-Num5:31)). Or he could pay a fine and end the engagement (see also *Mishnah Sotah* 1:1–5\). Joseph chose to be kind and decided to end the engagement quietly.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 1:19

## Matthew 1:20 (id: 21649)

The angel of the Lord told Joseph in a dream (see [Matthew 2:12–13](https://ref.ly/Matt2:12-Matt2:13), [19](https://ref.ly/Matt2:19), [22](https://ref.ly/Matt2:22)) that no one had seduced or harmed Mary. Instead, the baby was conceived by the Holy Spirit ([Luke 1:34–35](https://ref.ly/Luke1:34-Luke1:35)). The Holy Spirit often plays a creative and life\-giving role ([Genesis 1:2](https://ref.ly/Gen1:2); [Ezekiel 37:1–14](https://ref.ly/Ezek37:1-Ezek37:14); [John 3:5–8](https://ref.ly/John3:5-John3:8)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 1:20

## Matthew 1:21 (id: 21650)

* Jesus is the Greek version of the Hebrew name *Yeshua,* which means "The Lord saves." This name describes his role, that *he will save his people from their sins*.

* *His people* may refer to either Israel as a nation ([Matthew 2:6](https://ref.ly/Matt2:6)) or to the Messiah’s people, the church. This includes both Jews and non\-Jewish (gentile) people ([4:15–16](https://ref.ly/Matt4:15-Matt4:16); [16:18](https://ref.ly/Matt16:18); [28:18–20](https://ref.ly/Matt28:18-Matt28:20)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 1:21

## Matthew 1:22–23 (id: 21651)

Jesus being born from a virgin fulfills [Isaiah 7:14](https://ref.ly/Isa7:14). The Hebrew word *‘almah* can mean “virgin” or “young woman.” In the Greek Old Testament (the Septuagint), it was translated as *parthenos* (“virgin”), which Matthew quotes. Matthew sees the *‘almah* in Isaiah as pointing forward to the Virgin Mary.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 1:22–MAT 1:23

## Matthew 1:25 (id: 21652)

* *he had no union with her until she gave birth to a Son*: this might indicate that Joseph had sexual relations with Mary after Jesus was born. (Some traditions teach that Mary remained a virgin throughout her life.)
* Joseph named him Jesus, showing he accepted the child as his own.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 1:25

## Matthew 2:1 (id: 21879)

* Bethlehem was King David’s hometown ([1 Samuel 16:1–13](https://ref.ly/1Sam16:1-1Sam16:13); [John 7:42](https://ref.ly/John7:42)).
* King Herod was also called "Herod the Great." He had a rapid increase in power. He went from being the governor of Galilee to the king of Galilee, Judea, and Samaria. He was king from 37–4 BC. He was very loyal to Rome. He was famous for impressive building projects. This included a major renovation of the Temple in Jerusalem. His rule also included family conflicts, suspicion, and the murder of his own family members and innocent children (Josephus, *Antiquities* 15\.7\.1–5; [Matthew 2:16–18](https://ref.ly/Matt2:16-Matt2:18)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 2:1

## Matthew 2:1–2 (id: 21872)

The wise men's focus on the star shows they were astrologers. Their knowledge of the Old Testament (possibly [Numbers 24:17](https://ref.ly/Num24:17)) suggests they came from Babylonia, where many Jews lived. These men were gentiles (non\-Jewish people), which hints at God accepting gentiles in his kingdom ([Matthew 8:11–12](https://ref.ly/Matt8:11-Matt8:12); [15:21–28](https://ref.ly/Matt15:21-Matt15:28); [28:16–20](https://ref.ly/Matt28:16-Matt28:20)). 

All through the Gospel, unlikely gentiles worship the Jewish Messiah, while many Jewish leaders (Herod, the high priests, the teachers of religious law, and the Pharisees) oppose him.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 2:1–MAT 2:2

## Matthew 2:2 (id: 21883)

Matthew often describes Jesus as receiving worshipped ([Matthew 2:2](https://ref.ly/Matt2:2), [8](https://ref.ly/Matt2:8), [11](https://ref.ly/Matt2:11); [8:2](https://ref.ly/Matt8:2); [9:18](https://ref.ly/Matt9:18); [14:33](https://ref.ly/Matt14:33); [15:25](https://ref.ly/Matt15:25); [20:20](https://ref.ly/Matt20:20); [28:9](https://ref.ly/Matt28:9), [17](https://ref.ly/Matt28:17)). In this way, Matthew identifies Jesus as God.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 2:2

## Matthew 2:3 (id: 21884)

It worried Herod very much because he thought this child might challenge him as King of the Jews.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 2:3

## Matthew 2:4 (id: 21885)

The leading priests had political and religious influence and mainly served in the temple (see [Matthew 21:23](https://ref.ly/Matt21:23)). Herod gathered the teachers of religious law because they knew Old Testament prophecies and were often influential Pharisees.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 2:4

## Matthew 2:6 (id: 21886)

* Bethlehem was a small village. It was important because it was where King David was born. The religious leaders knew from prophecy ([Matthew 1:22](https://ref.ly/Matt1:22)) that this is where God would cause his Messiah to be born there.

* King David had been a shepherd when he was young. As king, he became the shepherd of Israel ([2 Samuel 5:2](https://ref.ly/2Sam5:2)). [Micah 5:2–4](https://ref.ly/Mic5:2-Mic5:4) predicts the Messiah as a shepherd (compare [Psalm 23:1](https://ref.ly/Ps23:1)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 2:6

## Matthew 2:8–10 (id: 21887)

God placed the star to guide the wise men to the Messiah (see [Numbers 24:17](https://ref.ly/Num24:17)). The details are unclear.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 2:8–MAT 2:10

## Matthew 2:11 (id: 21873)

The wise men gave costly gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh to the king (see [Psalm 72:10–17](https://ref.ly/Ps72:10-Ps72:17); [Isaiah 60](https://ref.ly/Isa60:1-Isa60:22)). The idea of three wise men comes from the number of gifts. But the text does not say how many wise men there were.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 2:11

## Matthew 2:13–15 (id: 21874)

*flee to Egypt … until I tell you*: This action fulfills the prophecy in [Hosea 11:1](https://ref.ly/Hos11:1) (refer to study note on Matthew 4:1–11; see also [Genesis 15:13–16](https://ref.ly/Gen15:13-Gen15:16); [46:1–5](https://ref.ly/Gen46:1-Gen46:5); [Exodus 15:1–21](https://ref.ly/Exod15:1-Exod15:21)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 2:13–MAT 2:15
* **Associated Articles:** Matthew 4:1-11 (ID: `22150@TyndaleStudyNotes`)

## Matthew 2:15 (id: 21875)

*Out of Egypt I called My Son*: See [Hosea 11:1](https://ref.ly/Hos11:1), which refers to when God led the Israelites out of Egypt.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 2:15

## Matthew 2:16 (id: 21876)

* *Put to death all the boys*: Herod was famous for his cruelty. He even killed his own son to protect his throne. This led to the saying, “It is safer to be Herod’s pig \[Greek *hus*] than his son \[Greek *huios*].” This is because Herod followed Jewish kosher laws.

* *two years old and under*: Herod estimated the child's age based on the wise men’s report.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 2:16

## Matthew 2:18 (id: 21877)

*Ramah* was a village near Bethlehem. It is where the patriarch Jacob buried his wife Rachel ([Genesis 35:18–20](https://ref.ly/Gen35:18-Gen35:20); [Jeremiah 31:15–17](https://ref.ly/Jer31:15-Jer31:17)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 2:18

## Matthew 2:19 (id: 21878)

*After Herod died*: Herod the Great died in 4 BC. Caesar (the Roman emperor) divided his kingdom. Herod's son Archelaus ([Matthew 2:22](https://ref.ly/Matt2:22)) became ruler of Judea, Samaria, and Idumea. Herod Antipas ([14:1–12](https://ref.ly/Matt14:1-Matt14:12); [Luke 13:31–32](https://ref.ly/Luke13:31-Luke13:32)) took charge of Galilee and Perea.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 2:19

## Matthew 2:20–21 (id: 21880)

Jesus returned to Israel to fulfill the prophecy in [Hosea 11:1](https://ref.ly/Hos11:1) (see [Hosea 2:13–15](https://ref.ly/Matt2:13-Matt2:15)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 2:20–MAT 2:21

## Matthew 2:22 (id: 21881)

* Archelaus*,* like his father, ruled with cruelty, injustice, and harshness.

* Joseph moved to Galilee to escape the control of Archelaus. This fulfilled a prophecy (see [Matthew 4:12–16](https://ref.ly/Matt4:12-Matt4:16)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 2:22

## Matthew 2:23 (id: 21882)

“*He will be called a Nazarene*”: Matthew connects the name *Nazareth* with words from the prophets (see [Isaiah 11:1](https://ref.ly/Isa11:1), where the Messiah is called a “Branch,” \[Hebrew netser]; and [Judges 13:5](https://ref.ly/Judg13:5), where Samson is called a “Nazirite”).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 2:23

## Matthew 3:1 (id: 22142)

* John the Baptist announced the arrival of Jesus (see [Mark 1:1–11](https://ref.ly/Mark1:1-Mark1:11); [Luke 3:1–22](https://ref.ly/Luke3:1-Luke3:22); [John 1:6–8](https://ref.ly/John1:6-John1:8), [19–34](https://ref.ly/John1:19-John1:34)). John helped people get ready to welcome him ([Matt 3:3](https://ref.ly/Matt3:3)). John drew large crowds ([3:5](https://ref.ly/Matt3:5)) and gathered a group of followers ([9:14](https://ref.ly/Matt9:14)). This group continued for a short time as a movement, even after the Christian church began (see [Acts 18:24–28](https://ref.ly/Acts18:24-Acts18:28)).

* John lived in the Judean wilderness. This was symbolic because the wilderness linked to God giving the law (see [Exodus 19:1](https://ref.ly/Exod19:1)). It also related to God's final redemption of Israel at the end of time (see [Isaiah 40:3](https://ref.ly/Isa40:3)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 3:1

## Matthew 3:2 (id: 22143)

The prophetic call to return to God means turning away from pride and sin and choosing humble obedience to God (compare [Isaiah 1:16–20](https://ref.ly/Isa1:16-Isa1:20) and [Jeremiah 3:11–22](https://ref.ly/Jer3:11-Jer3:22)). John’s message included specific practical advice ([Luke 3:11–14](https://ref.ly/Luke3:11-Luke3:14)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 3:2

## Matthew 3:3 (id: 22144)

Isaiah talked about someone making a path in the desert for God to come back to Israel ([Isaiah 40:1–11](https://ref.ly/Isa40:1-Isa40:11)). John's work got things ready for Jesus to arrive (see [Matthew 11:10](https://ref.ly/Matt11:10); compare [John 12:41](https://ref.ly/John12:41)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 3:3

## Matthew 3:4 (id: 22145)

John wore the same kind of clothes and ate the same kind of food as Elijah, a prophet who had lived many years before ([2 Kings 1:8](https://ref.ly/2Kgs1:8); [Malachi 4:5](https://ref.ly/Mal4:5); *Sirach*48:10–11\).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 3:4

## Matthew 3:5–6 (id: 22146)

* John's ministry became so popular that many people from Jerusalem and Judea came to hear him.
* *Confessing their sins*: Those who listened to John's preaching and turned away from sin were ready to accept the ministry of Jesus ([Luke 7:27](https://ref.ly/Luke7:27), [29](https://ref.ly/Luke7:29)).
* *they were baptized*: John's practice of baptism might have started with the Old Testament idea of purification (see [Isaiah 1:16](https://ref.ly/Isa1:16); [4:4](https://ref.ly/Isa4:4); [Ezekiel 36:25](https://ref.ly/Ezek36:25)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 3:5–MAT 3:6

## Matthew 3:7 (id: 22147)

* The Pahrisees' name comes from the Hebrew word *perushim*, which means *separated ones* or *exact interpreters*.
* The Sadducees, a group of priests, probably got their name from Zadok the priest ([2 Samuel 15:24–29](https://ref.ly/2Sam15:24-2Sam15:29); [Ezekiel 44:10–16](https://ref.ly/Ezek44:10-Ezek44:16)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 3:7

## Matthew 3:8 (id: 22148)

*Produce fruit, then, in keeping with repentance*: John calls for action and real ethical change. Only talking about it is not enough (see [Luke 3:10–14](https://ref.ly/Luke3:10-Luke3:14); compare [Matthew 5:19–20](https://ref.ly/Matt5:19-Matt5:20), [46](https://ref.ly/Matt5:46); [7:21](https://ref.ly/Matt7:21); [23:3](https://ref.ly/Matt23:3)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 3:8

## Matthew 3:9 (id: 22149)

* *Do not presume to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father’*: Some people had wrong assumptions. They thought that being descendants of Abraham meant they were free from God's judgment.
* A key theme in Matthew is that God will create new children of Abraham. He will include non\-Jews (gentiles) in God's people. He will remove Jews who reject the Messiah (see [8:11–12](https://ref.ly/Matt8:11-Matt8:12); [21:43](https://ref.ly/Matt21:43); [22:1–14](https://ref.ly/Matt22:1-Matt22:14); [28:16–20](https://ref.ly/Matt28:16-Matt28:20); [Romans 4:9–25](https://ref.ly/Rom4:9-Rom4:25); [Galatians 3:6–14](https://ref.ly/Gal3:6-Gal3:14), [29](https://ref.ly/Gal3:29)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 3:9

## Matthew 3:11 (id: 22136)

* *One more powerful than I*: Even though he was popular and many people continued to follow him, John knew he was less important than the Messiah.

* *whose sandals I am not worthy to carry*: In Jewish culture, removing and carrying sandals was a task for slaves. Not even a rabbi's disciple would do it.
* *with the Holy Spirit and with fire*: This happened at Pentecost (see [Joel 2:28–29](https://ref.ly/Joel2:28-Joel2:29); [Acts 2:1–47](https://ref.ly/Acts2:1-Acts2:47)). This may include Jesus's ministry, which the Holy Spirit powered (see [Matthew 12:28](https://ref.ly/Matt12:28); [Luke 4:14](https://ref.ly/Luke4:14)). Fire could mean purification ([Zech 13:9](https://ref.ly/Zech13:9)) or judgment ([Malachi 3:2–3;](https://ref.ly/Mal3:2-Mal3:3) [4:1](https://ref.ly/Mal4:1); see [Isaiah 1:25](https://ref.ly/Isa1:25); [4:4](https://ref.ly/Isa4:4)). It is a “Spirit\-and\-fire baptism.” The Messiah completes what John could only start—full judgment and purification.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 3:11

## Matthew 3:12 (id: 22137)

Farmers used a winnowing fork to throw harvested grain into the air, letting the useless husks (chaff) blow away. 

The Messiah's work separates humanity into two groups: 

1. the *wheat*, those who respond and become God's new people; and
2. the *chaff*, those who refuse to repent (see [Matthew 3:8](https://ref.ly/Matt3:8)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 3:12

## Matthew 3:14 (id: 22138)

John had already admitted ([Matthew 3:11–12](https://ref.ly/Matt3:11-Matt3:12)) that he was less important than the Messiah, so he felt unworthy to baptize him.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 3:14

## Matthew 3:15 (id: 22139)

*“It is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness in this way”*: This means completing what the Old Testament required or prophesied (for example, [Jeremiah 31:31–34](https://ref.ly/Jer31:31-Jer31:34)). In Matthew, “righteousness” means acting according to God’s will (see [Matthew 5:20](https://ref.ly/Matt5:20); [6:1](https://ref.ly/Matt6:1), [33](https://ref.ly/Matt6:33); [21:32](https://ref.ly/Matt21:32)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 3:15

## Matthew 3:16 (id: 22140)

The Spirit of God came down like a dove to anoint Jesus, who would bring salvation. This was similar to a king being anointed with oil at his crowning. The Holy Spirit gave Jesus the strength to achieve God's salvation and defeat Satan (see [Matthew 12:18](https://ref.ly/Matt12:18), [28](https://ref.ly/Matt12:28)). This same Spirit gives strength to the disciples of Jesus ([10:20](https://ref.ly/Matt10:20); [Acts 1:8](https://ref.ly/Acts1:8)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 3:16

## Matthew 3:17 (id: 22141)

* *This is My beloved Son* (see [Psalm 2:7](https://ref.ly/Ps2:7)): The title “Son of God” explains the nature and role of Jesus (see [Matthew 4:3](https://ref.ly/Matt4:3), [6](https://ref.ly/Matt4:6); [14:33](https://ref.ly/Matt14:33); [16:16](https://ref.ly/Matt16:16); [17:5](https://ref.ly/Matt17:5); [26:63](https://ref.ly/Matt26:63); [27:54](https://ref.ly/Matt27:54); [28:19](https://ref.ly/Matt28:19)). In his special relationship with God the Father, Jesus achieves salvation as the faithful and obedient Son.

* *in whom I am well pleased*: God the Father confirmed his Son’s work with words from Isaiah ([Isaiah 42:1](https://ref.ly/Isa42:1)) and prepared Israel for the work of Jesus.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 3:17

## Matthew 4:1 (id: 22159)

* *Jesus was led by the Spirit*: God arranged this test to examine the Messiah’s character (see [Deuteronomy 8:2](https://ref.ly/Deut8:2)).

* *to be tempted by the devil*: God started this test of character, using the devil's wish to lead Jesus into sin. God tempts no one ([James 1:13–14](https://ref.ly/Jas1:13-Jas1:14)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 4:1

## Matthew 4:1–11 (id: 22150)

This story of the temptation of Jesus shows clear parallels between Adam and Jesus. Jesus is the second Adam (see [Romans 5:12–19](https://ref.ly/Rom5:12-Rom5:19)) and the second Israel ([Matthew 2:15](https://ref.ly/Matt2:15)). Unlike the ancient Israelites, Jesus completed Israel’s history by wandering through the desert without sinning. He showed he was the obedient Son of God by defeating Satan in spiritual battle. 

Since Jesus faced temptation as a human, he can understand the temptations we encounter (see [Hebrews 2:14–18](https://ref.ly/Heb2:14-Heb2:18); [4:15](https://ref.ly/Heb4:15)). He helps us overcome them as he did ([1 Corinthians 10:13](https://ref.ly/1Cor10:13)).

## Matthew 4:2 (id: 22164)

*Forty days and forty nights* (see [Exodus 24:18](https://ref.ly/Exod24:18); [34:28](https://ref.ly/Exod34:28); [1 Kings 19:8](https://ref.ly/1Kgs19:8)): God tested Israel for forty\-years in the wilderness ([Exodus 16:35](https://ref.ly/Exod16:35); [Deuteronomy 1:3](https://ref.ly/Deut1:3)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 4:2

## Matthew 4:3–4 (id: 22165)

Jesus refused to use his supernatural power to get food, trusting God to provide it. The people of Israel relentlessly tested God with complaints and disbelief (see [Exodus 16](https://ref.ly/Exod16:1-Exod16:36)). But, Jesus refused to doubt God's faithfulness. Instead, he relied on God to meet his real need. This was the spiritual provision that comes from every word of God.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 4:3–MAT 4:4

## Matthew 4:5–7 (id: 22166)

Jesus refused to test God by assuming God would always protect him.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 4:5–MAT 4:7

## Matthew 4:7 (id: 22167)

*It is also written*: Jesus responded to the devil's use of Scripture by emphasizing a more important principle (honoring God) which the devil ignored.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 4:7

## Matthew 4:8–9 (id: 22168)

* Satan is called "the prince of this world" in [John 12:31](https://ref.ly/John12:31). He offered Jesus control over all the world's kingdoms and their power. Satan did this to try to stop Jesus from fulfilling God's will.

* *Glory* means political power and control (for example, [Matthew 6:29](https://ref.ly/Matt6:29)). Satan planned to tempt Jesus to misuse his divine nature as Son. He wanted to distract him from the path of suffering and obedience that led to the crucifixion.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 4:8–MAT 4:9

## Matthew 4:11 (id: 22151)

* *Then the devil left Him*: Jesus rejected Satan. This points ahead to his later victories over demons ([Matthew 12:28](https://ref.ly/Matt12:28)), Satan's defeat through the cross ([Colossians 2:14–15](https://ref.ly/Col2:14-Col2:15)), and the final victory at the end of time ([Romans 16:20](https://ref.ly/Rom16:20); [Revelation 12:7–17](https://ref.ly/Rev12:7-Rev12:17); [20:2–3](https://ref.ly/Rev20:2-Rev20:3), [10](https://ref.ly/Rev20:10)).

* Angelshad already been part of the Messiah's arrival and protection ([Matthew 1:20](https://ref.ly/Matt1:20), [24](https://ref.ly/Matt1:24); [2:13](https://ref.ly/Matt2:13), [19](https://ref.ly/Matt2:19)). Now they came and cared for Jesus after his temptation, fulfilling the Old Testament ([4:6](https://ref.ly/Matt4:6); see [Psalm 91:11–12](https://ref.ly/Ps91:11-Ps91:12)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 4:11

## Matthew 4:12 (id: 22153)

* Herod Antipas was the ruler of Galilee and Perea. He had arrested John the Baptist (see [14:1–12](https://ref.ly/Matt14:1-Matt14:12)). John was probably working in the area at this time.

* When Jesus heard about this, he left Judea. This was near Perea, where Herod had John arrested. Jesus then went back to Galilee. Jesus left to avoid death before he could finish his mission of revealing God's Kingdom. Like Joseph's escape to Nazareth ([Matthew 2:22–23](https://ref.ly/Matt2:22-Matt2:23)), avoiding danger can also be part of God's plan and fulfill prophecy ([4:14–16](https://ref.ly/Matt4:14-Matt4:16)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 4:12

## Matthew 4:12–11.1 (id: 22152)

John the Baptist and the Father announced Jesus as the Messiah ([3:13–17](https://ref.ly/Matt3:13-Matt3:17)). He then endured testing in the wilderness with obedience ([4:1–11](https://ref.ly/Matt4:1-Matt4:11)). After this, the Messiah was ready to begin his work. He first preached the message of the kingdom of God to the people of Galilee.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 4:12–MAT 4:17

## Matthew 4:13 (id: 22154)

Capernaum was in Galilee, a region that the religious leaders in Judea and Jerusalem viewed negatively (see [John 1:46](https://ref.ly/John1:46); [7:41–42](https://ref.ly/John7:41-John7:42), [52](https://ref.ly/John7:52)). Many people from Judea thought Galileans to be unrefined and poorly spoken (compare [Matt 26:73](https://ref.ly/Matt26:73)). The leaders believed these people could make their teachings less accurate. Galilee also had more non\-Jewish people than Judea.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 4:13

## Matthew 4:17 (id: 22155)

Jesus taught that the kingdom of heaven was coming soon and urged people to repent (stop doing what is wrong) in preparation (see [Matthew 3:2](https://ref.ly/Matt3:2); [10:7](https://ref.ly/Matt10:7)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 4:17

## Matthew 4:18 (id: 22157)

Simon, also known as Peter*,* became the leader of the apostles (see [14:28](https://ref.ly/Matt14:28); [15:15](https://ref.ly/Matt15:15); [16:16](https://ref.ly/Matt16:16)) and the representative disciple ([14:29–30](https://ref.ly/Matt14:29-Matt14:30); [16:15–19](https://ref.ly/Matt16:15-Matt16:19), [22–23](https://ref.ly/Matt16:22-Matt16:23)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 4:18

## Matthew 4:18–22 (id: 22156)

The call of the first disciples shows one purpose of the ministry of Jesus: to invite people to follow him with self\-denying obedience (compare [Matthew 4:17](https://ref.ly/Matt4:17), [23–25](https://ref.ly/Matt4:23-Matt4:25)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 4:18–MAT 4:22

## Matthew 4:19 (id: 22158)

* *Come, follow Me*: This meant accepting the beliefs and lifestyle of a teacher as your own ([Matthew 16:24](https://ref.ly/Matt16:24); [Deuteronomy 5:33](https://ref.ly/Deut5:33); [1 Kings 19:19–21](https://ref.ly/1Kgs19:19-1Kgs19:21)).

* *fishers of men*: The disciples would help in the saving and judging work of the kingdom of heaven (see [Matthew 10:5–15](https://ref.ly/Matt10:5-Matt10:15); [13:47–51](https://ref.ly/Matt13:47-Matt13:51); [Ezekiel 29:4–5](https://ref.ly/Ezek29:4-Ezek29:5); [Amos 4:2](https://ref.ly/Amos4:2)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 4:19

## Matthew 4:20–22 (id: 22160)

*They left the boat and their father*: To be disciples of Jesus required both commitment and sacrifice from the brothers (see [Matthew 8:18–22](https://ref.ly/Matt8:18-Matt8:22); [10:38](https://ref.ly/Matt10:38); [16:24](https://ref.ly/Matt16:24); [19:21](https://ref.ly/Matt19:21)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 4:20–MAT 4:22

## Matthew 4:23 (id: 22162)

* The Messiah's work focuses on three main activities: *teaching … preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing*.

* The *synagogues* were Jewish places for prayer, study, and discussing Scripture and tradition. They were also the social centers of many Jewish villages. The hypocrisy and hostility of Jewish leaders were obvious in the synagogues ([Matthew 6:2](https://ref.ly/Matt6:2), [5](https://ref.ly/Matt6:5); [10:17](https://ref.ly/Matt10:17); [12:9–14](https://ref.ly/Matt12:9-Matt12:14); [13:54](https://ref.ly/Matt13:54); [23:6](https://ref.ly/Matt23:6), [34](https://ref.ly/Matt23:34)).
* *Preaching the gospel* involves sharing the message about the kingdom of heaven ([9:35](https://ref.ly/Matt9:35); [24:14](https://ref.ly/Matt24:14); [26:13](https://ref.ly/Matt26:13); also [Mark 1:1](https://ref.ly/Mark1:1); [Romans 1:16](https://ref.ly/Rom1:16)). This message often causes hostility (see [Matthew 9:32–34](https://ref.ly/Matt9:32-Matt9:34); [10:27–28](https://ref.ly/Matt10:27-Matt10:28); [13:1–9](https://ref.ly/Matt13:1-Matt13:9), [18–23](https://ref.ly/Matt13:18-Matt13:23)).

## Matthew 4:23–25 (id: 22161)

This summary highlights the main theme of the section ([Matthew 4:23–9:38](https://ref.ly/Matt4:23-Matt9:38)): the work and message of the Messiah. In ancient writings, chapters did not exist. Authors would start and end a section with the same phrase (called an *inclusio*; see [9:35](https://ref.ly/Matt9:35)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 4:23–MAT 4:25

## Matthew 4:24–25 (id: 22163)

* During the time of Jesus, much of Palestine was under Roman control as part of Syria. At that time, Syria could mean the whole eastern Mediterranean coast. Matthew mentions Syria to show how far news of Jesus spread.

* *those having seizures*: This refers to epilepsy or demonic possession. In [17:15](https://ref.ly/Matt17:15), a person described this way "falls into the fire for into the water," meaning the boy could not control himself.
* *The* *Decapolis* was a group of ten cities, mostly east of the Jordan River and southeast of the Sea of Galilee. These included:

    + Damascus,
        + Raphana,
        + Hippos,
        + Abila (or Canatha),
        + Gadara,
        + Scythopolis,
        + Pella,
        + Dion,
        + Gerasa, and
        + Philadelphia (Amman).
        These cities were mostly gentile (non\-Jewish) and followed Greek culture.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 4:24–MAT 4:25

## Matthew 5:1–7.29 (id: 22169)

This is the first of five long teachings in Matthew (see also [9:35–11:1](https://ref.ly/Matt9:35-Matt11:1); [13:1–53](https://ref.ly/Matt13:1-Matt13:53); [18:1–19:2](https://ref.ly/Matt18:1-Matt19:2); [23:1–26:1](https://ref.ly/Matt23:1-Matt23:26)). The Sermon on the Mount focuses on the Messiah's call for people to become righteousness. Paul considered righteousness to be God's saving actions and a person's status before God. Jesus uses the term to mean moral behavior that obeys God's will, like the apostle James. *Righteousness* means doing God's will as Jesus reveals it. This "revelation of righteousness" connects the whole sermon.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 5:1–MAT 5:2

## Matthew 5:3 (id: 22191)

*The poor in spirit* (compare [Luke 6:20](https://ref.ly/Luke6:20), [24](https://ref.ly/Luke6:24)): in the Old Testament, the poor are often shown as very devoted to God because the rich oppress them. This oppression leads them to trust in the Lord for salvation and help, instead of relying on wealth ([Matthew 11:5](https://ref.ly/Matt11:5); [Psalms 37:14–15](https://ref.ly/Ps37:14-Ps37:15); [40:17](https://ref.ly/Ps40:17); [69:28–33](https://ref.ly/Ps69:28-Ps69:33); [Isaiah 61:1](https://ref.ly/Isa61:1); [66:2](https://ref.ly/Isa66:2)). 

In both Matthew’s and Luke’s writings, the “poor” are indeed financially poor, but their trust in God, not their poverty, makes them blessed ([Isaiah 57:15](https://ref.ly/Isa57:15); [66:2](https://ref.ly/Isa66:2)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 5:3

## Matthew 5:4 (id: 22198)

* *Those who mourn* are the people who felt sad about Israel's spiritual and national condition (see [Matthew 23:37–39](https://ref.ly/Matt23:37-Matt23:39); [Isaiah 61:2–3](https://ref.ly/Isa61:2-Isa61:3); [Joel 1:8–13](https://ref.ly/Joel1:8-Joel1:13); [2:12–13](https://ref.ly/Joel2:12-Joel2:13), [18–19](https://ref.ly/Joel2:18-Joel2:19); [Romans 9:1–5](https://ref.ly/Rom9:1-Rom9:5); [1 Corinthians 5:2](https://ref.ly/1Cor5:2); [James 4:9](https://ref.ly/Jas4:9)). It may also include to personal sorrow, whether from sin or tragedy ([Mark 16:10](https://ref.ly/Mark16:10); [Revelation 18:11](https://ref.ly/Rev18:11), [19](https://ref.ly/Rev18:19)).

* *will be comforted*: The passive voice shows respect for God's holy name. It could also mean God *will comfort them* (see also [Matthew 5:6–7](https://ref.ly/Matt5:6-Matt5:7), [9](https://ref.ly/Matt5:9)). Comfort will come when God fulfills all his promises ([Isaiah 40:1–2](https://ref.ly/Isa40:1-Isa40:2); [61:2–3](https://ref.ly/Isa61:2-Isa61:3)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 5:4

## Matthew 5:5 (id: 22199)

* *the meek:* Jesus almost directly quotes [Psalm 37:11](https://ref.ly/Ps37:11) here. In other places, Jesus describes himself in a similar way, contrasting with other teachers ([Matthew 11:29](https://ref.ly/Matt11:29)). He also avoids pride ([Matthew 12:17–21](https://ref.ly/Matt12:17-Matt12:21); [Matthew 21:5](https://ref.ly/Matt21:5)). Jesus shows this trait through his death on the cross ([1 Peter 2:23](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:23); [1 Peter 3:9](https://ref.ly/1Pet3:9)).

* The whole earth could also mean *the land*, referring to God's promise of land to Abraham and his descendants ([Genesis 12:7](https://ref.ly/Gen12:7); [Genesis 17:8](https://ref.ly/Gen17:8); see [Isaiah 60:21](https://ref.ly/Isa60:21)). It might also mean God's rule over the entire earth ([Matthew 19:28](https://ref.ly/Matt19:28); [Matthew 28:18–20](https://ref.ly/Matt28:18-Matt28:20); [Psalm 115:16](https://ref.ly/Ps115:16)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 5:5

## Matthew 5:6 (id: 22200)

* *Those who hunger and thirst for righteousness*: These are either followers of Jesus whose main purpose in life is to obey him (see [Matthew 3:15](https://ref.ly/Matt3:15); [5:10](https://ref.ly/Matt5:10), [20](https://ref.ly/Matt5:20)), or they could be people who want justice for everyone ([Psalms 11:7](https://ref.ly/Ps11:7); [85:10–12](https://ref.ly/Ps85:10-Ps85:12); [Isaiah 11:1–4](https://ref.ly/Isa11:1-Isa11:4); [Jeremiah 23:5–6](https://ref.ly/Jer23:5-Jer23:6); [33:16](https://ref.ly/Jer33:16)). They often pray, “Your will be done, on earth” ([Matthew 6:10](https://ref.ly/Matt6:10)).

* Christ has brought justice and righteousness ([Romans 3:21–22](https://ref.ly/Rom3:21-Rom3:22); [5:1](https://ref.ly/Rom5:1)), and his followers will find satisfaction in it (compare [Psalms 42:1–2](https://ref.ly/Ps42:1-Ps42:2); [63:1–2](https://ref.ly/Ps63:1-Ps63:2)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 5:6

## Matthew 5:7 (id: 22201)

Jesus emphasized the great importance of being merciful. This means to show kindness to those in need (see [Matthew 6:12](https://ref.ly/Matt6:12), [14–15](https://ref.ly/Matt6:14-Matt6:15); [9:13](https://ref.ly/Matt9:13); [12:7](https://ref.ly/Matt12:7); [18:23–35](https://ref.ly/Matt18:23-Matt18:35); [23:23](https://ref.ly/Matt23:23); [25:31–46](https://ref.ly/Matt25:31-Matt25:46)). Those who are merciful now will receive God's mercy at the final judgment.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 5:7

## Matthew 5:8 (id: 22202)

* *The pure in heart* (see [Psalms 24:3–5](https://ref.ly/Ps24:3-Ps24:5); [51:7](https://ref.ly/Ps51:7); [Isaiah 6:5](https://ref.ly/Isa6:5)) differ from those who believed they could please God by following human traditions (see [Matthew 23:25–26](https://ref.ly/Matt23:25-Matt23:26)). Jesus emphasized simple, genuine righteousness from within (see [6:1–24](https://ref.ly/Matt6:1-Matt6:24); [15:1–20](https://ref.ly/Matt15:1-Matt15:20); [23:23–28](https://ref.ly/Matt23:23-Matt23:28); [Deuteronomy 6:5](https://ref.ly/Deut6:5)).

* *They will see God* and achieve more than Moses did (see [Exodus 33:18–23](https://ref.ly/Exod33:18-Exod33:23); [34:5–7](https://ref.ly/Exod34:5-Exod34:7); see also [Psalm 73:1](https://ref.ly/Ps73:1)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 5:8

## Matthew 5:9 (id: 22203)

* This teaching likely addressed zealots. These were Jewish revolutionaries who wanted to overthrow Roman rule with violence. The Messiah’s kingdom would come through different methods.

* *the peacemakers*: Jesus was not calling for complete pacifism. Instead, he called for a new kind of action.
* Peace means no hostility and the presence of God’s salvation ([Leviticus 26:6](https://ref.ly/Lev26:6); [1 Samuel 16:4–5](https://ref.ly/1Sam16:4-1Sam16:5); [Isaiah 9:5–6](https://ref.ly/Isa9:5-Isa9:6); [Zechariah 8:16](https://ref.ly/Zech8:16); [Ephesians 2:14](https://ref.ly/Eph2:14); [Colossians 1:20](https://ref.ly/Col1:20)). Those who follow Jesus should work for justice, righteousness, reconciliation, and mercy. These should be the *effects* of God’s salvation through Christ ([Matthew 5:43–47](https://ref.ly/Matt5:43-Matt5:47); [Luke 10:5–6](https://ref.ly/Luke10:5-Luke10:6)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 5:9

## Matthew 5:10–11 (id: 22170)

The first followers of Jesus were persecuted by Jewish leaders who were offended by the new teaching of Jesus, which revealed God’s truth with authority (see [Matthew 10:17–23](https://ref.ly/Matt10:17-Matt10:23); [11:2–6](https://ref.ly/Matt11:2-Matt11:6); [12:1–8](https://ref.ly/Matt12:1-Matt12:8); [15:1–20](https://ref.ly/Matt15:1-Matt15:20); [23:34–36](https://ref.ly/Matt23:34-Matt23:36)). Since then, following Jesus and his teachings has often led to persecution ([10:24–25](https://ref.ly/Matt10:24-Matt10:25); [2 Timothy 3:12](https://ref.ly/2Tim3:12)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 5:10–MAT 5:11

## Matthew 5:12 (id: 22171)

* The *great …* *reward* Jesus talks about is not earned by suffering for doing right. It is God's blessing for those who show his grace to others (see [Matthew 10:41–42](https://ref.ly/Matt10:41-Matt10:42); [20:1–16](https://ref.ly/Matt20:1-Matt20:16)).

* The ancient *prophets* are closely connected with the New Testament apostles (see also [13:16–17](https://ref.ly/Matt13:16-Matt13:17); [23:29–36](https://ref.ly/Matt23:29-Matt23:36); [Ephesians 2:20](https://ref.ly/Eph2:20)).

## Matthew 5:13 (id: 22173)

* People used salt for a number of reasons:

    + to clean and prevent decay ([Ezekiel 16:4](https://ref.ly/Ezek16:4)),
        + in making agreements ([Leviticus 2:13](https://ref.ly/Lev2:13); [Numbers 18:19](https://ref.ly/Num18:19); see study note on 2 Chronicles 13:5), and
        + to flavor food ([Job 6:6](https://ref.ly/Job6:6); [Mark 9:50](https://ref.ly/Mark9:50)).

* *Salt* that *loses its savor*becomes useless or tasteless (see [Mark 9:50](https://ref.ly/Mark9:50); [Luke 14:34](https://ref.ly/Luke14:34)).

## Matthew 5:14 (id: 22174)

*Light of the world … city on a hill*: How the disciples live will inspire others to live the same way and honor God (see [Isaiah 2:2–5](https://ref.ly/Isa2:2-Isa2:5); [42:6](https://ref.ly/Isa42:6); [49:6](https://ref.ly/Isa49:6); [51:4](https://ref.ly/Isa51:4); [56:6–8](https://ref.ly/Isa56:6-Isa56:8); [60:1–3](https://ref.ly/Isa60:1-Isa60:3); [Philippians 2:15](https://ref.ly/Phil2:15)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 5:16

## Matthew 5:17 (id: 22176)

* To *abolish* would mean to remove and replace the Law of Moses and the writings of the prophets (that is, the whole Old Testament) as God’s revelation of his will.

* *until everything is accomplished*: This could mean to obey the Old Testament perfectly, complete their teachings, or fulfill their prophecies (see [Matthew 1:22](https://ref.ly/Matt1:22); [2:15](https://ref.ly/Matt2:15), [17](https://ref.ly/Matt2:17), [23](https://ref.ly/Matt2:23)). Jesus himself embodies everything the Prophets and the Law taught and expected. Now that Christ has arrived, who fulfills these writings, we must understand the Old Testament in relation to him ([Luke 24:26](https://ref.ly/Luke24:26), [44](https://ref.ly/Luke24:44)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 5:17

## Matthew 5:19 (id: 22177)

* The fulfillment of the Law in Christ means that his disciples must obey all of his commands (see [Matthew 28:20](https://ref.ly/Matt28:20)).

* *commandments:* This refers to Old Testament commands ([5:18](https://ref.ly/Matt5:18)) now fulfilled in Christ's teachings (see [5:21–48](https://ref.ly/Matt5:21-Matt5:48)).
* *least in the kingdom of heaven:* Jesus may mean that such a person will still enter the kingdom, but only barely and with low status. Another view, based on some Jewish evidence, is that he means eternal exclusion or damnation (compare [8:12](https://ref.ly/Matt8:12), where “those for whom the Kingdom was prepared” are shut out forever).

## Matthew 5:20 (id: 22178)

*Unless your righteousness exceeds:* The disciples of Jesus need a new kind of righteousness that only he teaches and makes possible. [Matthew 5:21–47](https://ref.ly/Matt5:21-Matt5:47) shows this and [5:48](https://ref.ly/Matt5:48) summarizes what it is. 

This righteousness is different in amount and quality. Jesus is greater than the temple ([12:6](https://ref.ly/Matt12:6)) and Jonah ([12:41](https://ref.ly/Matt12:41)). So, the righteousness of his disciples must greatly surpass that of the Jewish religious teachers and Pharisees (see [3:7–9](https://ref.ly/Matt3:7-Matt3:9)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 5:20

## Matthew 5:21 (id: 22180)

*it was said to the ancients*: The expression refers to the traditional interpretation of the teachers of religious law and Pharisees. Their traditions did not allow murder*,* but they did allow hatred. The righteous way of life required by Jesus surpasses this attitude. It demands people to live in peace with each other ([Matthew 5:23–24](https://ref.ly/Matt5:23-Matt5:24)). It is not enough to only avoid committing murder ([5:22](https://ref.ly/Matt5:22)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 5:21

## Matthew 5:21–47 (id: 22179)

*You have heard …**But I tell you*: Jesus contrasts his teachings to six misunderstandings of the law. Each example shows the surpassing righteousness of Jesus. Jesus reveals God's will, which contrasts with human traditions.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 5:21–MAT 5:47

## Matthew 5:22 (id: 22181)

* *Judgment … Sanhedrin … hell*: The second and third punishments are more severe than usual in the time of Jesus. This emphasizes the surpassing righteousness of Jesus and his followers (see [Matthew 5:20](https://ref.ly/Matt5:20)). They did not accept unresolved conflicts or treating other people as unimportant.

* *anyone who says to his brother, ‘Raca’*: The Aramaic term *reqa’* (transliterated as *raca*) means something like "empty head." This probably means the same thing as cursing someone (literally *if you say, ‘You fool’;* compare [James 2:20](https://ref.ly/Jas2:20)). Thinking that other people are unimportant is a sin that expresses itself in different ways.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 5:22

## Matthew 5:23–26 (id: 22182)

Jesus provides two examples of making peace in communities and society.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 5:23–MAT 5:26

## Matthew 5:27–30 (id: 22183)

The righteousness of Jesus exposes sin beyond only outward actions. He shows the true purpose of the law.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 5:27–MAT 5:30

## Matthew 5:29 (id: 22185)

*Hell* (Greek *Gehenna*): *Gehenna* was the name of a valley outside Jerusalem. Some kings of Judah used this place to worship idols and even offered children as sacrifices by fire ([2 Chronicles 28:3](https://ref.ly/2Chr28:3); [33:6](https://ref.ly/2Chr33:6); [Jeremiah 7:31](https://ref.ly/Jer7:31); [32:35](https://ref.ly/Jer32:35)). King Josiah eventually destroyed this site ([2 Kings 23:10](https://ref.ly/2Kgs23:10)). 

In the New Testament, *Gehenna* refers to the place where God punishes. Jesus taught that unless his followers live with greater righteousness (living in the right way before God), they will not enter God’s kingdom ([Matthew 5:20](https://ref.ly/Matt5:20)). Instead, they will face eternal punishment ([5:22](https://ref.ly/Matt5:22); [23:33](https://ref.ly/Matt23:33)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 5:29

## Matthew 5:29–30 (id: 22184)

*If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away*: These vivid images demand a complete rejection of sin. But even extreme actions like self\-harm cannot stop a lustful mind. Jesus calls for a greater righteousness that only he can provide.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 5:29–MAT 5:30

## Matthew 5:31 (id: 22187)

*A certificate of divorce* is a document that makes a divorce legal. Evidence shows this document allowed remarriage. “The essential formula in the notice of divorce is, ‘Lo, you are free to marry any man.’ … The essential formula in a writ of emancipation is, ‘Lo, you are a freedwoman: lo, you belong to yourself’” (*Mishnah Gittin* 9:3\).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 5:31

## Matthew 5:31–32 (id: 22186)

Jesus challenges how people misuse the Old Testament rules about divorce (see [Deuteronomy 24:1–4](https://ref.ly/Deut24:1-Deut24:4); compare [Matthew 19:3–9](https://ref.ly/Matt19:3-Matt19:9)). Only following the rules does not make divorce right. Jesus permits divorce only for sexual infidelity and bans casual divorce (see also [1 Corinthians 7:10–11](https://ref.ly/1Cor7:10-1Cor7:11)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 5:31–MAT 5:32

## Matthew 5:32 (id: 22188)

* The exception clause allows, but does not require divorce if a spouse is unfaithful (see also [Matthew 19:9](https://ref.ly/Matt19:9)). Importantly, Jesus does not require death for the guilty person (see [Deuteronomy 22:21–22](https://ref.ly/Deut22:21-Deut22:22)).

* The idea is that if a man divorces his wife for the wrong reasons, he forces her into adultery by making her remarry. This would violate the law.
* *he who marries a divorced woman*: It is unclear if Jesus means any divorced woman or only those divorced without a valid reason (like unfaithfulness). Jewish divorce law assumed that legitimate divorces allowed remarriage.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 5:32

## Matthew 5:33–37 (id: 22189)

Jesus explains the Old Testament's teachings on oaths ([Leviticus 19:12](https://ref.ly/Lev19:12); [Numbers 30:2–4](https://ref.ly/Num30:2-Num30:4); [Deuteronomy 23:21–23](https://ref.ly/Deut23:21-Deut23:23); [Psalm 50:14](https://ref.ly/Ps50:14); [Zechariah 8:17](https://ref.ly/Zech8:17)). 

The Pharisees had different levels of commitment for oaths. For example, oaths not mentioning God were less serious. Jesus teaches that everything connects to God. This includes heaven, earth, Jerusalem, my head (see also [Matthew 23:16–22](https://ref.ly/Matt23:16-Matt23:22)). So, breaking any oath disobeys God's command (see [Exodus 20:7](https://ref.ly/Exod20:7)). 

The main idea is to always be truthful. The teachings of Jesus make a disciple's simple "yes or no" as serious as an oath. Honest people do not need oaths ([James 5:12](https://ref.ly/Jas5:12)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 5:33–MAT 5:37

## Matthew 5:38–42 (id: 22190)

The Old Testament allowed fair retribution (payback) ([Exodus 21:24–25](https://ref.ly/Exod21:24-Exod21:25); [Deuteronomy 19:16–21](https://ref.ly/Deut19:16-Deut19:21)) to keep punishments from being too severe. Yet, Jesus does not allow personal revenge for his disciples. Instead, Jesus teaches finding victory through suffering and the cross ([1 Peter 2:23](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:23)). 

Some consider this teaching as a guide for all aspects of life, including politics. Others consider it to apply to personal willingness to give up rights and forgive as God forgives (see [Matt 5:48](https://ref.ly/Matt5:48); [18:23–35](https://ref.ly/Matt18:23-Matt18:35)). Like the servant in [Isaiah 50:4–9](https://ref.ly/Isa50:4-Isa50:9) and [53:7](https://ref.ly/Isa53:7) (see also [Matthew 12:15–21](https://ref.ly/Matt12:15-Matt12:21)), the followers of Jesus should apply this virtue to honor, possessions, time, or property. True righteousness does not demand its own way.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 5:38–MAT 5:42

## Matthew 5:41 (id: 22192)

Forced labor was a humiliating part of Roman rule (see [Matthew 27:32](https://ref.ly/Matt27:32)). Jesus transformed it into a chance to joyfully serve God. This saying shows that Jesus opposed Jewish revolutionaries, who called for violent resistance (see [5:9](https://ref.ly/Matt5:9)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 5:41

## Matthew 5:42 (id: 22193)

See [Deuteronomy 15:7–11](https://ref.ly/Deut15:7-Deut15:11).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 5:42

## Matthew 5:43–47 (id: 22194)

*Hate your enemy*: Jesus is not rejecting the Old Testament. Instead, he is correcting a traditional interpretation that was mistaken (see [Exodus 23:4–5](https://ref.ly/Exod23:4-Exod23:5)). The Old Testament never commands people to “hate your enemy.” The closest verses are in [Psalm 139:21–22](https://ref.ly/Ps139:21-Ps139:22), where hatred is expressed toward God’s enemies.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 5:43–MAT 5:47

## Matthew 5:45 (id: 22195)

By loving everyone, the followers of Jesus would not *become* children of God. Their actions would demonstrate that they are already God's true children, living according to his nature and will (see [Deuteronomy 10:18–19](https://ref.ly/Deut10:18-Deut10:19)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 5:45

## Matthew 5:47 (id: 22196)

*If you greet only your brothers*: Jews were taught to greet gentiles (non\-Jews) to keep peaceful relations. But such greetings were not the same as those given to “brothers,” meaning fellow Jews.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 5:47

## Matthew 5:48 (id: 22197)

* This verse connects [5:20–48](https://ref.ly/Matt5:20-Matt5:48) as a single unit (see study note on Matthew 4:23–25).

* *be perfect*: The word “perfect” means maturity, wholeness, and full devotion to God. It describes a complete response to the message of Jesus about the kingdom ([19:21](https://ref.ly/Matt19:21); [Ephesians 4:13](https://ref.ly/Eph4:13); [Philippians 3:15](https://ref.ly/Phil3:15); [Colossians 1:28](https://ref.ly/Col1:28); [4:12](https://ref.ly/Col4:12); [1 John 4:18](https://ref.ly/1John4:18)). True perfection has love at its center (see [Luke 6:36](https://ref.ly/Luke6:36)).

## Matthew 6:1 (id: 22209)

* This verse begins the teaching in [Matthew 6:2–18](https://ref.ly/Matt6:2-Matt6:18). Jesus explains that righteousness (living in line with God’s will) should not be done for public recognition. It should be offered as service to God.

* *Righteous acts* are actions that follow God’s way of living. Examples include:

    + giving gifts to those in need ([6:2–4](https://ref.ly/Matt6:2-Matt6:4)),
        + praying ([6:5–15](https://ref.ly/Matt6:5-Matt6:15)), and
        + fasting ([6:16–18](https://ref.ly/Matt6:16-Matt6:18)).
        Jesus encourages keeping these actions private to avoid seeking personal praise instead of honoring God (compare [5:16](https://ref.ly/Matt5:16)).

## Matthew 6:4 (id: 22219)

*Your Father … will reward you*: This is true both now and at the final judgment, which is at the end of history (see [Matthew 25:31–46](https://ref.ly/Matt25:31-Matt25:46)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 6:4

## Matthew 6:5 (id: 22220)

*When you pray*: Jews prayed regularly at 9 am and 3 pm (see [Acts 3:1](https://ref.ly/Acts3:1)). They often gathered for public prayer. Hypocrites purposely chose public places at these times so everyone would notice them.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 6:5

## Matthew 6:6 (id: 22221)

*Go into your inner room*: Jesus is not opposed to group prayer (see [Matthew 18:19–20](https://ref.ly/Matt18:19-Matt18:20); [Luke 11:2–4](https://ref.ly/Luke11:2-Luke11:4)). He tells his disciples not to use prayer to seek attention.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 6:6

## Matthew 6:7–8 (id: 22222)

God cannot be persuaded by repeating words over and over. The Lord’s Prayer is a simple and authoritative model ([Matthew 6:9–13](https://ref.ly/Matt6:9-Matt6:13)), unlike the lengthy prayers of pagans.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 6:7–MAT 6:8

## Matthew 6:9 (id: 22224)

* *This is how you should pray*: This introduces what is often called the Lord’s Prayer. Unlike the long and repeated prayers of pagan worshipers ([6:7–8](https://ref.ly/Matt6:7-Matt6:8)).

* Most Jewish prayers did not call God “Father.” But Jesus did so in nearly every prayer. The only exception is his cry on the cross ([Mark 15:34](https://ref.ly/Mark15:34)).
* *hallowed be Your name*: This means that God’s name should be honored. In the Old Testament, God’s name was dishonored when his people sinned ([Isaiah 29:22–24](https://ref.ly/Isa29:22-Isa29:24); [Jeremiah 34:15–16](https://ref.ly/Jer34:15-Jer34:16); [Ezekiel 39:7](https://ref.ly/Ezek39:7); [Amos 2:7](https://ref.ly/Amos2:7)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 6:9

## Matthew 6:9–13 (id: 22223)

The Lord’s Prayer is similar to a typical Jewish prayer called the *qaddish*. Jesus taught this prayer to his disciples as a brief summary of their new faith.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 6:9–MAT 6:13

## Matthew 6:10 (id: 22204)

* When the disciples of Jesus pray for God’s kingdom to come soon, they are asking for his justice, righteousness, peace, and mercy to be established.

* No one rejecting the will of God can enter God's presence ([Matthew 7:21](https://ref.ly/Matt7:21); [12:50](https://ref.ly/Matt12:50); [21:28–32](https://ref.ly/Matt21:28-Matt21:32)).
* *on earth as it is in heaven*: This probably refers to all three petitions, not just the third.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 6:10

## Matthew 6:11 (id: 22205)

*Give us this day our daily bread*: A disciple can confidently ask God to provide for daily needs. Then the disciple can continue the work of the kingdom without worry ([Matthew 6:25–34](https://ref.ly/Matt6:25-Matt6:34)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 6:11

## Matthew 6:12 (id: 22206)

*As we also have forgiven* (see also [Matthew 6:14–15](https://ref.ly/Matt6:14-Matt6:15); [18:21–35](https://ref.ly/Matt18:21-Matt18:35)): Forgiving others shows that a person has repented and received new life from God. This makes our own forgiveness possible. Those who have experienced God’s forgiveness will also forgive. Jesus warns that people who refuse to forgive have not understood God’s mercy and may not have truly repented.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 6:12

## Matthew 6:13 (id: 22207)

* *And lead us not into temptation*: Just as Jesus was tested ([Matthew 4:1–11](https://ref.ly/Matt4:1-Matt4:11)), temptation will test a disciple's character. Jesus encourages prayer for God's help to withstand the test (see [26:41](https://ref.ly/Matt26:41); [Psalm 141:4](https://ref.ly/Ps141:4)).

* *from the evil one*: This phrase can also be translated “from evil.” The first reading points to Satan, the one who tempts people (see [James 1:13](https://ref.ly/Jas1:13)). The second reading points to sin in general.
* "*for Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory, forever. Amen*": Some later manuscripts add a doxology (a short hymn of praise) at the end of the Lord’s Prayer. It was probably taken from [1 Chronicles 29:11–13](https://ref.ly/1Chr29:11-1Chr29:13) and used to shape the prayer for public worship.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 6:13

## Matthew 6:16 (id: 22208)

People often connect prayer and fasting ([Leviticus 23:27–32](https://ref.ly/Lev23:27-Lev23:32); [Nehemiah 9:1–2](https://ref.ly/Neh9:1-Neh9:2); [Zechariah 7:3–5](https://ref.ly/Zech7:3-Zech7:5); [8:19](https://ref.ly/Zech8:19); [Luke 18:12](https://ref.ly/Luke18:12)). Before the time of Jesus, some Israelites misused this practice ([Isaiah 58:3–12](https://ref.ly/Isa58:3-Isa58:12)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 6:16

## Matthew 6:20 (id: 22210)

*Treasures in heaven*: For Jews during the time of Jesus, this was a common image. Obeying God’s commands was seen as storing up treasures with God. The context ([6:19](https://ref.ly/Matt6:19); [Luke 12:33](https://ref.ly/Luke12:33)) shows that Jesus was mainly referring to acts of charity.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 6:20

## Matthew 6:22 (id: 22211)

* *The eye is the lamp*: The eye gives light to the body and helps guide the whole person.

* A "good" eye means a morally healthy outlook. It points to simple and wholehearted devotion to God ([6:24](https://ref.ly/Matt6:24)). Here, it also means being generous.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 6:22

## Matthew 6:24 (id: 22212)

The word translated "money" is traditionally translated *mammon.* This is an Aramaic term for profits or material possessions. God does not tolerate rivals, so Jesus often warns about the danger of gathering wealth ([Matthew 13:22](https://ref.ly/Matt13:22); [19:16–30](https://ref.ly/Matt19:16-Matt19:30); [26:14–16](https://ref.ly/Matt26:14-Matt26:16); [27:3–10](https://ref.ly/Matt27:3-Matt27:10); [28:11–15](https://ref.ly/Matt28:11-Matt28:15)). This can become an idol (see [Ephesians 5:5](https://ref.ly/Eph5:5); [Colossians 3:5](https://ref.ly/Col3:5)). We must trust God to provide our needs ([Matthew 4:3–4](https://ref.ly/Matt4:3-Matt4:4); [6:8](https://ref.ly/Matt6:8), [11](https://ref.ly/Matt6:11), [25–34](https://ref.ly/Matt6:25-Matt6:34); [7:7–11](https://ref.ly/Matt7:7-Matt7:11); [10:9–14](https://ref.ly/Matt10:9-Matt10:14); [14:15–21](https://ref.ly/Matt14:15-Matt14:21); [15:32–38](https://ref.ly/Matt15:32-Matt15:38)). The community of disciples should support each other ([6:2–4](https://ref.ly/Matt6:2-Matt6:4); [10:40–42](https://ref.ly/Matt10:40-Matt10:42); [19:21](https://ref.ly/Matt19:21); [23:23–24](https://ref.ly/Matt23:23-Matt23:24); [25:31–46](https://ref.ly/Matt25:31-Matt25:46); [26:6–13](https://ref.ly/Matt26:6-Matt26:13); [27:57–61](https://ref.ly/Matt27:57-Matt27:61)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 6:24

## Matthew 6:25–34 (id: 22213)

Jesus taught people to live without worry by trusting God to provide for them. His disciples abandoned everything ([Matthew 4:18–22](https://ref.ly/Matt4:18-Matt4:22); [9:9](https://ref.ly/Matt9:9); [10:5–14](https://ref.ly/Matt10:5-Matt10:14)). Jesus encouraged them that God would provide their needs.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 6:25–MAT 6:34

## Matthew 6:26 (id: 22214)

Jesus teaches by moving from lesser to greater: If God the Father cares for the birds (the lesser), he will surely care for his disciples (the greater). Because the disciples are much more valuable to him, they can trust that he will provide for their needs (see also [Matthew 10:29–31](https://ref.ly/Matt10:29-Matt10:31)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 6:26

* *Gentiles*: This word refers to people who do not know God and do not follow his will (see also [Matthew 20:19](https://ref.ly/Matt20:19)).

* *your heavenly Father knows*: Prayer does not give God new information about needs. Prayer shows trust in God to provide what is needed.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 6:32

## Matthew 6:33 (id: 22218)

Here, Jesus offers a positive alternative to worrying. His disciples should focus on their commitment to God and seek his kingdom through Christ (see [Matthew 6:19–24](https://ref.ly/Matt6:19-Matt6:24)). This should be their main concern.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 6:33

## Matthew 7:1 (id: 22232)

* Mercy is a key theme in the teachings and actions of Jesus ([Matthew 9:9–13](https://ref.ly/Matt9:9-Matt9:13); [12:1–7](https://ref.ly/Matt12:1-Matt12:7)). But Jesus also clearly opposes sin ([18:15–20](https://ref.ly/Matt18:15-Matt18:20); [23:13–33](https://ref.ly/Matt23:13-Matt23:33)). Jesus also warns against controlling or condemning others in the name of care. The kind of judgment he forbids is often harsh criticism of small or trivial matters([23:23–24](https://ref.ly/Matt23:23-Matt23:24)). Only God has the right to judge ([James 4:11–12](https://ref.ly/Jas4:11-Jas4:12)).

* *do not judge, or you will be judged*: This may refer to God's judgment at the end of time ([Matthew 5:7](https://ref.ly/Matt5:7)). God evaluates us based on how we treat others ([6:12](https://ref.ly/Matt6:12); [18:21–35](https://ref.ly/Matt18:21-Matt18:35)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 7:1

## Matthew 7:3–5 (id: 22240)

Jesus encourages his disciples to serve others instead of condemning them. The contrast of a speck (speck of dust, chip of wood) to a log in the eye is an exaggerated image meant to show the huge difference (see [Matthew 5:29](https://ref.ly/Matt5:29); [23:23–24](https://ref.ly/Matt23:23-Matt23:24); compare [Micah 6:6–8](https://ref.ly/Mic6:6-Mic6:8)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 7:3–MAT 7:5

## Matthew 7:6 (id: 22241)

* Rabbis often referred to important ideas or Scripture verses as pearls. The mysteries of the kingdom of God ([13:11](https://ref.ly/Matt13:11)) are holy (see [Exodus 29:33](https://ref.ly/Exod29:33); [Leviticus 2:3](https://ref.ly/Lev2:3); [22:10–16](https://ref.ly/Lev22:10-Lev22:16); [Numbers 18:8–10](https://ref.ly/Num18:8-Num18:10)).

* *do not give dogs what is holy*: Jews often referred to non\-Jewish (gentile) people as dogs or pigs because these animals were ceremonially unclean ([Matthew 15:26](https://ref.ly/Matt15:26); [Psalm 22:16](https://ref.ly/Ps22:16), [20](https://ref.ly/Ps22:20); [Leviticus 11](https://ref.ly/Lev11:1-Lev11:47)). Some think this means that many gentiles would not accept the message of the kingdom. Others see it as a warning about sharing the message of the kingdom with resistant Jewish leaders (see [Matthew 5:20](https://ref.ly/Matt5:20); [10:11–14](https://ref.ly/Matt10:11-Matt10:14); see also [Hebrews 10:29](https://ref.ly/Heb10:29)). It could be a warning to unbelievers in general (see [Matthew 18:17](https://ref.ly/Matt18:17); see also [1 Corinthians 2:13–16](https://ref.ly/1Cor2:13-1Cor2:16); [2 Peter 2:21–22](https://ref.ly/2Pet2:21-2Pet2:22)).

## Matthew 7:7–8 (id: 22242)

This passage teaches persistence in prayer. But Jesus does not say God will fulfill extravagant desires. God's people should seek daily needs and spiritual blessings ([Matthew 6:10–11](https://ref.ly/Matt6:10-Matt6:11)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 7:7–MAT 7:8

## Matthew 7:12 (id: 22225)

*The Law and the Prophets*: The teachings of Jesus in [5:21–7:6](https://ref.ly/Matt5:21-Matt7:6) show the true purpose and way to express the law of Moses. Love is central for the disciples of Jesus (see also [Galatians 5:13–14](https://ref.ly/Gal5:13-Gal5:14), [18](https://ref.ly/Gal5:18)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 7:12

## Matthew 7:13 (id: 22227)

* *Enter through the narrow gate*: This means deciding to obey Jesus as the Messiah. The wide gate and broad road represent the choice not to follow Jesus or his teachings.

* This path leads to *destruction*. This means being thrown into fire, being kept out of the kingdom of heaven, being banished from the presence of Jesus, and finally being ruined ([Matthew 7:19–23](https://ref.ly/Matt7:19-Matt7:23), [27](https://ref.ly/Matt7:27)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 7:13

## Matthew 7:13–27 (id: 22226)

The Sermon on the Mount ends with a call to decide about Jesus and his teachings (see [Matthew 4:23](https://ref.ly/Matt4:23); [9:35](https://ref.ly/Matt9:35)). Those who hear the message of Jesus about the kingdom must obey him to gain eternal life. Or else, they reject him and God will condemn them. There is no third way ([Deuteronomy 30:15–20](https://ref.ly/Deut30:15-Deut30:20); [Psalm 1](https://ref.ly/Ps1:1-Ps1:6); [Proverbs 12:28](https://ref.ly/Prov12:28); [Jeremiah 21:8](https://ref.ly/Jer21:8)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 7:13–MAT 7:27

## Matthew 7:14 (id: 22228)

Only a few people accept the truth shown in Christ (see [Matthew 19:23](https://ref.ly/Matt19:23); [20:16](https://ref.ly/Matt20:16); [22:14](https://ref.ly/Matt22:14); see also [John 3:19](https://ref.ly/John3:19); [6:66–71](https://ref.ly/John6:66-John6:71)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 7:14

## Matthew 7:15–20 (id: 22229)

*False prophets* tell people what they want to hear instead of calling them to obey God's will. [Deuteronomy 13:1–5](https://ref.ly/Deut13:1-Deut13:5) and [18:21–22](https://ref.ly/Matt18:21-Matt18:22) provide guidelines to determine if someone is a true prophet. A prophet's words must match with God's word, and a prophet's prophecies must come true. 

Jesus explains the first rule. A prophet's actions must match his words to be trustworthy. So, a true prophet's actions will also match God's word. In the same way that fruit shows what kind of tree it comes from, a person's life shows if their inner being is good or not. 

Christians should expect false prophets at the end of time (see [Matthew 24:11](https://ref.ly/Matt24:11), [24](https://ref.ly/Matt24:24); [Acts 20:28–35](https://ref.ly/Acts20:28-Acts20:35); [Revelation 13:11–18](https://ref.ly/Rev13:11-Rev13:18); [16:13](https://ref.ly/Rev16:13); [19:20](https://ref.ly/Rev19:20); [20:10](https://ref.ly/Rev20:10)). Christians can avoid these false prophets misleading them. But Christians must be careful and wise (see [1 Corinthians 12:10](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:10); [14:29](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:29); [1 Thessalonians 5:21](https://ref.ly/1Thess5:21); [1 John 4:1–3](https://ref.ly/1John4:1-1John4:3); [Revelation 2:20](https://ref.ly/Rev2:20)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 7:15–MAT 7:20

## Matthew 7:16–17 (id: 22230)

Good fruit and bad fruit symbolize moral behavior (see [Matthew 3:8](https://ref.ly/Matt3:8), [10](https://ref.ly/Matt3:10); [12:33–37](https://ref.ly/Matt12:33-Matt12:37); [13:8](https://ref.ly/Matt13:8); [21:43](https://ref.ly/Matt21:43); [Galatians 5:19–23](https://ref.ly/Gal5:19-Gal5:23)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 7:16–MAT 7:17

## Matthew 7:18 (id: 22231)

Spiritual rebirth is essential to produce the good actions that Jesus demands. Good works come from faith, and they are inseparable (see [James 2:14–26](https://ref.ly/Jas2:14-Jas2:26)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 7:18

## Matthew 7:21 (id: 22233)

*The will of My Father*: The teachings of Jesus show what the will of the Father is (see also [12:50](https://ref.ly/Matt12:50); [21:28–32](https://ref.ly/Matt21:28-Matt21:32); [Romans 2:13](https://ref.ly/Rom2:13); [James 1:22–27](https://ref.ly/Jas1:22-Jas1:27)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 7:21

## Matthew 7:22 (id: 22234)

* *On that day*: The Old Testament concept behind this idea is the "day of the Lord." On this day, God will save the faithful and condemn those who oppress others ([Isaiah 13–14](https://ref.ly/Isa13:1-Isa14:32); [Joel 2:1–32](https://ref.ly/Joel2:1-Joel2:32); [Zephaniah 1:14–16](https://ref.ly/Zeph1:14-Zeph1:16)). In the teachings of Jesus, this day is when everyone will be judged based on how they respond to him (see [Matthew 10:15](https://ref.ly/Matt10:15); [11:20–24](https://ref.ly/Matt11:20-Matt11:24); [12:36](https://ref.ly/Matt12:36); [24:19–50](https://ref.ly/Matt24:19-Matt24:50); [25:13](https://ref.ly/Matt25:13), [31–46](https://ref.ly/Matt25:31-Matt25:46); [Acts 17:31](https://ref.ly/Acts17:31); [Romans 2:16](https://ref.ly/Rom2:16)).

* Neither spiritual gifts or public accomplishments in the name of Jesus will guarantee God's approval. The decisive issue is obedience ([Matthew 7:21](https://ref.ly/Matt7:21)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 7:22

## Matthew 7:23 (id: 22235)

*I never knew you*: These people were never truly converted, even though they did great works in the name of God. They refused to follow the Father's will as taught by Jesus, and they continued to break Gods commands. Because they never knew Christ, they never learned to do what he commanded.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 7:23

## Matthew 7:24 (id: 22237)

* A wise person realizes that Jesus fulfills the Old Testament promises. So a wise person willingly obeys Jesus and chooses to live in such a way that leads to blessings ([Matthew 5:3–12](https://ref.ly/Matt5:3-Matt5:12); [7:13–14](https://ref.ly/Matt7:13-Matt7:14)).

* *built his house on the rock:* Building a house directly on rock provides a much stronger foundation than would a dry, sandy riverbed or floodplain ([7:26](https://ref.ly/Matt7:26)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 7:24

## Matthew 7:24–27 (id: 22236)

This entire sermon ([Matthew 5:3–7:27](https://ref.ly/Matt5:3-Matt7:27)) focuses on following the teachings of Jesus by living righteously ([5:20](https://ref.ly/Matt5:20)). Listening without obedience is like choosing the wide gate and broad way that leads to ruin ([James 1:22–25](https://ref.ly/Jas1:22-Jas1:25); [2:14–26](https://ref.ly/Jas2:14-Jas2:26)). A decision is necessary in light of what God has revealed (see [Leviticus 26](https://ref.ly/Lev26:1-Lev26:46); [Deuteronomy 28](https://ref.ly/Deut28:1-Deut28:68), [30](https://ref.ly/Deut30:1-Deut30:20)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 7:24–MAT 7:27

## Matthew 7:25–27 (id: 22238)

The storm symbolizes God's all\-knowing judgment (see [Jeremiah 23:19](https://ref.ly/Jer23:19); [Ezekiel 1:4](https://ref.ly/Ezek1:4)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 7:25–MAT 7:27

## Matthew 7:28–29 (id: 22239)

* At first, Jesus began teaching only his disciples ([Matthew 5:1](https://ref.ly/Matt5:1)). But large crowds soon followed him up the mountainside.

* The teachers of religious law based their authority on Scripture they quoted or on the traditions of earlier scholars. In contrast, Jesus taught with direct authority.

    He did quote Scripture in the Sermon on the Mount. Yet his words carried the weight of his own authority as the Messiah (God’s chosen one).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 7:28–MAT 7:29

## Matthew 8:1–9.34 (id: 22243)

Here, the kingdom of God appears with supernatural power (see [Matthew 4:23–25](https://ref.ly/Matt4:23-Matt4:25); [11:2–6](https://ref.ly/Matt11:2-Matt11:6)). It reaches people who were previously excluded from God's blessings. This included: 

* non\-Jewish people,
* lepers,
* blind people,
* sick women,
* people possessed by demons,
* tax collectors,
* those with long\-term bleeding, and
* the dead.

Jesus showed compassion to people in need. But the religious leaders reacted with anger and opposition. Jesus called his followers to respond with faith and to walk in discipleship (living as his learners and followers).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 8:1–MAT 9:34

## Matthew 8:2 (id: 22259)

Leprosy refers to various skin diseases. People with leprosy (lepers) were ceremonially unclean and excluded from society. They could only return once they had no symptoms and a priest declared them clean (see [Matthew 8:4](https://ref.ly/Matt8:4); [Leviticus 14:2–32](https://ref.ly/Lev14:2-Lev14:32)). Sometimes leprosy was a judgment from God ([Numbers 12:9–15](https://ref.ly/Num12:9-Num12:15); [2 Kings 5:27](https://ref.ly/2Kgs5:27); [15:5](https://ref.ly/2Kgs15:5)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 8:2

## Matthew 8:3 (id: 22263)

*Be clean*: When Jesus healed lepers, it showed the presence of God's kingdom in him and his work ([Matthew 11:2–6](https://ref.ly/Matt11:2-Matt11:6)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 8:3

## Matthew 8:4 (id: 22264)

The healed leper would show everyone that the religious leaders were wrong not to trust the Messiah ([Matthew 10:18](https://ref.ly/Matt10:18)) or that Jesus followed the law of Moses ([5:17](https://ref.ly/Matt5:17)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 8:4

## Matthew 8:5 (id: 22266)

* *Capernaum* is on the Sea of Galilee, four kilometers (about two and a half miles) west of where the Jordan River flows out. In the time of Jesus, it was a thriving fishing village. Located at an important crossroads on the Great Trunk Road, it connected Mesopotamia and Egypt. It was an international village. Much of the ministry Jesus did in Galilee happened there (for example, [Matthew 4:13](https://ref.ly/Matt4:13); [8:14–17](https://ref.ly/Matt8:14-Matt8:17)).

* *The centurion*: He was one of sixty commanders in a legion and led 100 Roman soldiers (see also [Mark 15:39](https://ref.ly/Mark15:39); [Acts 10:1](https://ref.ly/Acts10:1); [27:1](https://ref.ly/Acts27:1)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 8:5

## Matthew 8:5–13 (id: 22265)

Jesus once again served people who were pushed aside or rejected. The centurion was a gentile soldier. Helping him would have caused strong anger from both nationalistic Jews and separatist Jews.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 8:5–MAT 8:13

## Matthew 8:7 (id: 22267)

*I will go* (compare [Acts 10:9–35](https://ref.ly/Acts10:9-Acts10:35); [Galatians 2:11–14](https://ref.ly/Gal2:11-Gal2:14)): Some scholars interpret this as a question: *Should I* \[a Jew] *enter* \[a gentile's house, risking impurity] *and heal him?*

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 8:7

## Matthew 8:8–10 (id: 22268)

The centurion recognized the authority of Jesus. From his own experience, he knew his soldiers quickly obeyed his orders. He realized that God had given Jesus the authority to perform miracles. The centurion’s faith demonstrates that the kingdom of God includes people from all nations ([8:11](https://ref.ly/Matt8:11)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 8:8–MAT 8:10

## Matthew 8:11–12 (id: 22244)

The coming of gentiles fulfills Old Testament promises ([Isaiah 2:2–3](https://ref.ly/Isa2:2-Isa2:3)). God promised Abraham that he would be a blessing to many nations, not just the Jewish people ([Genesis 18:18](https://ref.ly/Gen18:18)). Christ fulfills this promise ([Galatians 3:8](https://ref.ly/Gal3:8), [16](https://ref.ly/Gal3:16)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 8:11–MAT 8:12

## Matthew 8:16 (id: 22246)

*with a word:* Jesus showed his powerful authority. His words alone could heal and give life.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 8:16

## Matthew 8:16–17 (id: 22245)

Jesus has authority to heal every disease and rule over every demon.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 8:16–MAT 8:17

## Matthew 8:17 (id: 22247)

*He took on our infirmities and carried our diseases*: When he took on the sins of humanity, the Messiah also carried our sickness (infirmities and diseases). Diseases exist because sin is in the world. One effect of Jesus taking our sin on the cross is physical healing ([1 Peter 2:24](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:24)). When Jesus healed people and cast out evil spirits, he showed that he is the Messiah (God's chosen one) as Scripture promised (see [Matthew 11:2–6](https://ref.ly/Matt11:2-Matt11:6); [12:28](https://ref.ly/Matt12:28); [1 Corinthians 11:29–30](https://ref.ly/1Cor11:29-1Cor11:30); [James 5:13–16](https://ref.ly/Jas5:13-Jas5:16)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 8:17

## Matthew 8:18–22 (id: 22248)

Jesus once met two people who said they wanted to be his followers. Jesus explained what it really means to follow him. He wanted them to understand that following him required serious commitment.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 8:18–MAT 8:22

## Matthew 8:19 (id: 22249)

The teachers of religious law had an honored job. They preserved, learned, and explained the Scriptures to benefit society. People thought the way to God was through them ([Matthew 15:13–14](https://ref.ly/Matt15:13-Matt15:14); [23:13](https://ref.ly/Matt23:13)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 8:19

## Matthew 8:20 (id: 22250)

Being a disciple of Jesus is not easy. It requires more than knowing the right things. Following Jesus includes being willing to give up life’s normal comforts.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 8:20

## Matthew 8:21 (id: 22251)

* *Another of His disciples*: This statement suggests that the teacher in verse [19](https://ref.ly/Matt8:19) was also a disciple. Calling Jesus "Lord" shows a strong commitment to him.

* *bury my father*: In Judaism, this was a very important religious duty. But Jesus requires complete dedication to him.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 8:21

## Matthew 8:22 (id: 22252)

*Let the dead bury their own dead*. Those who opposed Jesus might have seen these words as ignoring the commandment to honor parents ([Exodus 20:12](https://ref.ly/Exod20:12)). But it actually reinforces the first commandment ([Exodus 20:1–3](https://ref.ly/Exod20:1-Exod20:3)). The authority of Jesus as the Messiah justified this statement. Living for the kingdom of heaven influences normal human life, including family ties and commitments (see [Matthew 10:34–39](https://ref.ly/Matt10:34-Matt10:39); [12:46–50](https://ref.ly/Matt12:46-Matt12:50); [19:29](https://ref.ly/Matt19:29); [Zechariah 13:3](https://ref.ly/Zech13:3); [Luke 14:26–27](https://ref.ly/Luke14:26-Luke14:27)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 8:22

## Matthew 8:23–27 (id: 22253)

This story continues the theme of true discipleship. In the storm, the disciples had to trust Jesus with their very lives for safety and rescue. Jesus showed that he even has authority over dangerous weather and the sea (see [Job 38:8–11](https://ref.ly/Job38:8-Job38:11); [Psalms 29](https://ref.ly/Ps29:1-Ps29:11); [65:1–13](https://ref.ly/Ps65:1-Ps65:13); [89:9](https://ref.ly/Ps89:9); [107:23–32](https://ref.ly/Ps107:23-Ps107:32)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 8:23–MAT 8:27

## Matthew 8:24 (id: 22254)

A fierce storm came upon the lake. Sudden strong winds are common on the Sea of Galilee since mountains surround it.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 8:24

## Matthew 8:27 (id: 22255)

*What kind of man is this?:* To receive salvation, people must recognize who Jesus is and put their trust in him. At this point, his disciples still did not understand.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 8:27

## Matthew 8:28 (id: 22257)

*demon\-possessed …* *so violent*: When people were possessed by demons, they often became violent. Other signs included:

* fear of the Son of God ([Matthew 8:29](https://ref.ly/Matt8:29)),
* being unable to speak ([9:32](https://ref.ly/Matt9:32); [12:22](https://ref.ly/Matt12:22)),
* blindness ([12:22](https://ref.ly/Matt12:22)),
* seizures ([17:15](https://ref.ly/Matt17:15)),
* and doing things to hurt themselves ([17:15](https://ref.ly/Matt17:15)).

When Jesus cast out demons, it showed that the power of God’s kingdom had entered human history ([12:28](https://ref.ly/Matt12:28)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 8:28

## Matthew 8:28–34 (id: 22256)

This event focuses on the authorityof Jesus and the cost of being his disciple. Those who have faith, like the Messiah, will experience opposition.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 8:28–MAT 8:34

## Matthew 8:29 (id: 22258)

* Those controlled by Satan immediately recognized Jesus as the Son of God (see [Mark 1:24](https://ref.ly/Mark1:24)). This answered the question asked by the disciples of Jesus when he calmed the storm ([Matthew 8:27](https://ref.ly/Matt8:27)). In other places, the true nature and identity of Jesus are acknowledged by the Father ([3:17](https://ref.ly/Matt3:17); [17:5](https://ref.ly/Matt17:5)), Satan ([4:3](https://ref.ly/Matt4:3), [6](https://ref.ly/Matt4:6)), people ([14:33](https://ref.ly/Matt14:33); [16:16](https://ref.ly/Matt16:16); [27:54](https://ref.ly/Matt27:54)), and Christ himself ([11:27](https://ref.ly/Matt11:27); [24:36](https://ref.ly/Matt24:36); [28:19](https://ref.ly/Matt28:19)).

* *the appointed time*: This phrase points to the final judgment. At that time, God will condemn forever all who oppose him (see [Jude 1:6](https://ref.ly/Jude1:6); [Revelation 20:10](https://ref.ly/Rev20:10)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 8:29

## Matthew 8:31 (id: 22260)

The demons could not resist the power of Jesus. They begged to escape their coming destruction.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 8:31

## Matthew 8:32 (id: 22261)

* The words of Jesus had power to drive out demons.

* *died in the waters*: This showed that Jesus had begun to defeat the enemy ([Matthew 12:28](https://ref.ly/Matt12:28); [Luke 10:17–20](https://ref.ly/Luke10:17-Luke10:20); [Romans 16:20](https://ref.ly/Rom16:20); [Colossians 2:15](https://ref.ly/Col2:15)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 8:32

## Matthew 8:34 (id: 22262)

The sad part is that people who saw the Son of God's power to save were afraid of change, so they rejected him.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 8:34

## Matthew 9:1 (id: 22277)

Jesus lived in Capernaum ([Mark 2:1](https://ref.ly/Mark2:1)). He seems to have moved there from Nazareth after the people of Nazareth rejected him ([Matthew 4:13](https://ref.ly/Matt4:13); [Luke 4:16–31](https://ref.ly/Luke4:16-Luke4:31)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 9:1

## Matthew 9:1–17 (id: 22269)

There was debate and conflict among Jesus opponents. This included the teachers of the law and the Pharisees ([Matthew 9:1–13](https://ref.ly/Matt9:1-Matt9:13)), and also the disciples of John the Baptist ([9:14–17](https://ref.ly/Matt9:14-Matt9:17)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 9:1–MAT 9:17

## Matthew 9:3 (id: 22290)

*This man is blaspheming*: Only God can forgive sins ([Psalm 103:3](https://ref.ly/Ps103:3); [Isaiah 43:25](https://ref.ly/Isa43:25); [Jeremiah 50:20](https://ref.ly/Jer50:20)). The teachers of religious law failed to understand the mission of Jesus as God's Son who became human ([Matthew 3:17](https://ref.ly/Matt3:17); [11:25–27](https://ref.ly/Matt11:25-Matt11:27)). As God's Messiah ([1:1](https://ref.ly/Matt1:1); [11:2–6](https://ref.ly/Matt11:2-Matt11:6)), Jesus was saving humanity ([8:17](https://ref.ly/Matt8:17); [26:26–28](https://ref.ly/Matt26:26-Matt26:28)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 9:3

## Matthew 9:5 (id: 22291)

It may seem easier for Jesus to say, “Your sins are forgiven,” since no one can see immediate proof. But it is much harder to heal a paralyzed man so that he can walk. The visible miracle proved that Jesus had the authority to forgive sins. It forced those who saw it to decide what they believed about him.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 9:5

## Matthew 9:6 (id: 22292)

*So that you may know:* Jesus performed the miracle to demonstrate his authority and identity as God's Messiah (see [Matthew 11:2–6](https://ref.ly/Matt11:2-Matt11:6); [12:28](https://ref.ly/Matt12:28)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 9:6

## Matthew 9:8 (id: 22293)

The crowd responded with fear and admiration because they realized a powerful truth about Jesus. He is truly the Son of God with the authority to forgive sins on earth ([9:6](https://ref.ly/Matt9:6)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 9:8

## Matthew 9:9 (id: 22295)

Another name for the apostle Matthew was Levi ([Mark 2:14](https://ref.ly/Mark2:14)). He might have had two names, or Jesus might have given him a new name.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 9:9

## Matthew 9:9–13 (id: 22294)

Jesus, as Lord and Messiah, removed the obstacles that stopped righteous Jews from interacting with people considered ceremonially unclean or sinful.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 9:9–MAT 9:13

## Matthew 9:10 (id: 22270)

The Jewish people hated Jewish tax collectors ([Matthew 5:46–47](https://ref.ly/Matt5:46-Matt5:47); [18:15–20](https://ref.ly/Matt18:15-Matt18:20)). This was because they worked with Roman rulers. Jews considered them traitors against Israel. Many also considered them ceremonially unclean because of their contact with gentiles and the images on Roman coins. 

Tax collection was a private business. In each area, Rome gave the right to collect taxes to the highest bidder (compare [Luke 19:1–10](https://ref.ly/Luke19:1-Luke19:10)). Collectors kept any money they gathered above their bid. Out of greed, they often used threats to get the money.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 9:10

## Matthew 9:13 (id: 22271)

* *I desire mercy, not sacrifice*: Jesus applies this desire of God to eating with sinners. Jesus showed mercy by eating with them. This contrasted with the Pharisees who avoided sinners. They considered their avoidance to symbolize sacrifices.

* Jesus exposed the Pharisees' true spiritual state. The Pharisees considered themselves to be righteous. But they were actually unrighteous and needed the Messiah to save them ([Matthew 7:1–5](https://ref.ly/Matt7:1-Matt7:5); [8:11–12](https://ref.ly/Matt8:11-Matt8:12); [19:30](https://ref.ly/Matt19:30); [20:16](https://ref.ly/Matt20:16); [21:43](https://ref.ly/Matt21:43)).

## Matthew 9:14 (id: 22272)

*Fast*: Fasting was a way to show humility and repentance before God ([2 Samuel 12:16–23](https://ref.ly/2Sam12:16-2Sam12:23); [Daniel 9:3](https://ref.ly/Dan9:3)). It also reminded the nation of their need to repent ([Leviticus 16:29–31](https://ref.ly/Lev16:29-Lev16:31); [Nehemiah 9:1](https://ref.ly/Neh9:1)). Some believed fasting would help bring the Messiah more quickly by purifying God’s people.

Jesus and his disciples did not fast ([Matthew 11:18–19](https://ref.ly/Matt11:18-Matt11:19)) This was a quiet but clear message: the Messiah had already come (see also [6:16](https://ref.ly/Matt6:16)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 9:14

## Matthew 9:15 (id: 22273)

* *The guests of the bridegroom*: John the Baptist described the Messiah and his disciples this way ([John 3:29](https://ref.ly/John3:29)). He used Old Testament images to show who Jesus really was (see [Matthew 25:1–13](https://ref.ly/Matt25:1-Matt25:13); [Isaiah 54:5–6](https://ref.ly/Isa54:5-Isa54:6)).

* *taken away*: This is the first prediction Jesus made about his violent death (see [Matthew 16:21](https://ref.ly/Matt16:21); [17:12](https://ref.ly/Matt17:12), [22–23](https://ref.ly/Matt17:22-Matt17:23); [20:18–19](https://ref.ly/Matt20:18-Matt20:19); [26:2](https://ref.ly/Matt26:2), [26–35](https://ref.ly/Matt26:26-Matt26:35); [Isaiah 53:8](https://ref.ly/Isa53:8)).
* *then they will fast*: Jesus might be talking about the disciples' sadness right after his crucifixion, or their way of living after his death and resurrection (see [Acts 9:9](https://ref.ly/Acts9:9); [13:2–3](https://ref.ly/Acts13:2-Acts13:3); [14:23](https://ref.ly/Acts14:23); [27:9](https://ref.ly/Acts27:9), [33](https://ref.ly/Acts27:33)).

## Matthew 9:16–17 (id: 22274)

These short parables compare the new covenant (the promises between God and his people) that Jesus began ([Matthew 6:26–29](https://ref.ly/Matt26:26-Matt26:29)) with the old covenant. The comparison focuses especially on religious ceremonies like fasting. Jesus completes the law, but he does not cancel it ([5:17–20](https://ref.ly/Matt5:17-Matt5:20); see [Galatians 2:21](https://ref.ly/Gal2:21); [5:4](https://ref.ly/Gal5:4)). At the same time, the new covenant brings new practices.

## Matthew 9:18 (id: 22276)

* *Place Your hand on her*: Placing hands on someone is a visible sign of praying for God's power to help them. It often results in new life or ministries ([Matthew 19:13](https://ref.ly/Matt19:13); [Numbers 27:18–23](https://ref.ly/Num27:18-Num27:23); [Deuteronomy 34:9](https://ref.ly/Deut34:9)).

* The man believed Jesus could raise the dead (see [1 Kings 17:8–24](https://ref.ly/1Kgs17:8-1Kgs17:24); [2 Kings 4:18–37](https://ref.ly/2Kgs4:18-2Kgs4:37)).

## Matthew 9:20 (id: 22278)

* Because of her constant bleeding, the woman was always considered ceremonially unclean. Anyone she touched was also unclean ([Leviticus 15:25–30](https://ref.ly/Lev15:25-Lev15:30)). But when she touched Jesus, instead of making him unclean, she was made clean. This surprising reversal shows the power to heal, redeem, and make holy (see [Matthew 14:36](https://ref.ly/Matt14:36); [Mark 3:10](https://ref.ly/Mark3:10)).

* *fringe*: The tassels at the bottom of a tunic ([Matthew 23:5](https://ref.ly/Matt23:5); [Numbers 15:37–41](https://ref.ly/Num15:37-Num15:41)) reminded Jews to obey God's law.

The Old Testament prophesies that when the Messiah came he would restore sight to the blind ([Matthew 11:4–5](https://ref.ly/Matt11:4-Matt11:5); [Isaiah 29:18–19](https://ref.ly/Isa29:18-Isa29:19); [35:5–6](https://ref.ly/Isa35:5-Isa35:6)).

* *Son of David* is a title connected to the Messiah and miraculous healings (see [Matthew 1:1](https://ref.ly/Matt1:1); [12:23](https://ref.ly/Matt12:23); [15:22](https://ref.ly/Matt15:22); [20:30–31](https://ref.ly/Matt20:30-Matt20:31); [2 Samuel 7:12–16](https://ref.ly/2Sam7:12-2Sam7:16)).

Jesus expands his ministry (see [Matthew 4:23–9:34](https://ref.ly/Matt4:23-Matt9:34)) by sending his disciples to other people in Israel ([10:5–6](https://ref.ly/Matt10:5-Matt10:6)). The instructions Jesus gives his disciples ([10:5–42](https://ref.ly/Matt10:5-Matt10:42)) emphasizes missionary work and the opposition and challenges they will encounter.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 9:35–MAT 11:1

*Like sheep without a shepherd*: Jesus grieved the failure of the Pharisees to guide the people with care (see [Matthew 12:11–12](https://ref.ly/Matt12:11-Matt12:12); [18:12](https://ref.ly/Matt18:12)). Their constant attacks against him showed their hard\-hearted rejection of God. Because of this neglect and mistreatment, the crowds suffered greatly ([10:5–6](https://ref.ly/Matt10:5-Matt10:6); [15:12–14](https://ref.ly/Matt15:12-Matt15:14); [23:4](https://ref.ly/Matt23:4); [Zechariah 11:16](https://ref.ly/Zech11:16)).

* *Harvest* refers to the great number of people who are ready to hear and respond to God’s message (see also [Matthew 13:24–30](https://ref.ly/Matt13:24-Matt13:30), [36–43](https://ref.ly/Matt13:36-Matt13:43); [Mark 4:26–29](https://ref.ly/Mark4:26-Mark4:29); [John 4:35–38](https://ref.ly/John4:35-John4:38); [Revelation 14:15–20](https://ref.ly/Rev14:15-Rev14:20)).

* *the Lord of the harvest*: God is the true master of the harvest. All ministries are under his call (see [Matthew 23:8–10](https://ref.ly/Matt23:8-Matt23:10), [13](https://ref.ly/Matt23:13)). So Jesus encourages his disciples to pray for God to send out more workers.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 9:37–MAT 9:38

## Matthew 10:1 (id: 21662)

* Jesus called his twelve disciples as workers in the harvest ([Matthew 9:37–38](https://ref.ly/Matt9:37-Matt9:38)). Choosing twelve was on purpose, reminding people of the twelve tribes of Israel. Jesus was appointing new leaders for God's new people under his rule as the Messiah ([16:18–19](https://ref.ly/Matt16:18-Matt16:19); [18:18](https://ref.ly/Matt18:18); [19:28](https://ref.ly/Matt19:28); [21:43](https://ref.ly/Matt21:43)).

* *Jesus gave them authority* ([9:6–8](https://ref.ly/Matt9:6-Matt9:8); [28:18](https://ref.ly/Matt28:18)): Jesus empowered the twelve apostles to perform tasks that Jewish leaders could not do ([9:32–34](https://ref.ly/Matt9:32-Matt9:34); [10:5–8](https://ref.ly/Matt10:5-Matt10:8)). Jesus shows his authority to cast out evil spirits ([8:28](https://ref.ly/Matt8:28)) and to heal in similar ways ([4:23](https://ref.ly/Matt4:23); [8:1–9:35](https://ref.ly/Matt8:1-Matt9:35)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 10:1

## Matthew 10:2 (id: 21669)

* The *apostles* are ambassadors sent by Christ's authority to represent him and complete specific tasks (see [Matthew 10:1–8](https://ref.ly/Matt10:1-Matt10:8), [40](https://ref.ly/Matt10:40); [28:16–20](https://ref.ly/Matt28:16-Matt28:20)). The term *apostle* also refers to Paul ([Galatians 1:1](https://ref.ly/Gal1:1)).

* *first Simon, called Peter*: Peter was the first apostle chosen by Jesus ([Matthew 4:18–22](https://ref.ly/Matt4:18-Matt4:22); [16:17–19](https://ref.ly/Matt16:17-Matt16:19)). He served as the leader of the apostles (see [19:27](https://ref.ly/Matt19:27); [26:33](https://ref.ly/Matt26:33); [Acts 2:14](https://ref.ly/Acts2:14)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 10:2

## Matthew 10:2–4 (id: 21663)

The New Testament contains four lists of the apostles (see also [Mark 3:16–19](https://ref.ly/Mark3:16-Mark3:19); [Luke 6:14–16](https://ref.ly/Luke6:14-Luke6:16); [Acts 1:13](https://ref.ly/Acts1:13)). These lists are slightly different.

The order of names changes, but the groups remain the same. The main difference is between “Thaddaeus” ([10:3](https://ref.ly/Matt10:3); [Mark 3:18](https://ref.ly/Mark3:18)) and “Judas son of James” ([Luke 6:16](https://ref.ly/Luke6:16); [Acts 1:13](https://ref.ly/Acts1:13)). These may be two names for the same person.

Matthew, the tax collector (see [Matthew 9:9](https://ref.ly/Matt9:9)), is also known as Levi ([Mark 2:14](https://ref.ly/Mark2:14)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 10:3

## Matthew 10:4 (id: 21677)

* *the Zealot*: Zealots were militant Jews who believed violence and war could achieve God's will. As a Jewish nationalist, Simon was probably passionate about the law ([Acts 22:3–5](https://ref.ly/Acts22:3-Acts22:5); [Galatians 1:14](https://ref.ly/Gal1:14); [Philippians 3:6](https://ref.ly/Phil3:6)). The Jewish historian Josephus blamed the Zealot party for the major war with Rome from AD 66–70\.

* *Iscariot* might refer to someone from Kerioth in southern Judea ([Joshua 15:25](https://ref.ly/Josh15:25)) or from Kerioth in Perea ([Jeremiah 48:24](https://ref.ly/Jer48:24)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 10:4

## Matthew 10:5 (id: 21678)

* *Do not go onto the road of the Gentiles*: At this time, Jesus' mission was limited to the Jews ([Matthew 15:24](https://ref.ly/Matt15:24)). God would reach gentiles (non\-Jewish people) through the Jews ([Isaiah 2:2–4](https://ref.ly/Isa2:2-Isa2:4); [42:6–7](https://ref.ly/Isa42:6-Isa42:7); [49:6](https://ref.ly/Isa49:6); [60:3](https://ref.ly/Isa60:3)).
* Jews saw *Samaritans* as impure Jews ([Luke 17:18](https://ref.ly/Luke17:18)) because they married gentiles during and after the Assyrian and Babylonian exiles ([2 Kings 17:24–41](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:24-2Kgs17:41)). The tension between Jews and Samaritans grew worse in 128 BC when John Hyrcanus, a Jewish leader, destroyed the Samaritan temple on Mount Gerizim (Josephus, *Antiquities* 13\.9\.1\).

Jesus' disciples should trust God to provide ([6:11](https://ref.ly/Matt6:11), [25–34](https://ref.ly/Matt6:25-Matt6:34); [7:7–11](https://ref.ly/Matt7:7-Matt7:11)). They should avoid greed, which could harm God's reputation. They should also encourage new communities to provide what their leaders need (see [1 Corinthians 9:3–19](https://ref.ly/1Cor9:3-1Cor9:19)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 10:9–MAT 10:10

*greet its occupants*: Greetings meant more than just saying "hello." They often included a blessing for the person receiving it (see [Ruth 2:4](https://ref.ly/Ruth2:4)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 10:12

## Matthew 10:13 (id: 21657)

* The disciples’ blessing was an offer of salvation. Taking back the blessing was a sign of judgment as the offer was removed.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 10:13

## Matthew 10:14 (id: 21658)

*Shake the dust off your feet*: This act was like the actions of a prophet. It came from an Israelite custom: when crossing back into Israel, they would shake off the dust of Gentile lands to show rejection of ungodliness.

For the disciples, the gesture meant rejecting those who opposed God’s work (see [Acts 18:6](https://ref.ly/Acts18:6)). Speaking judgment on those who refuse the message was part of proclaiming the good news about God’s kingdom (see [Matthew 11:20–24](https://ref.ly/Matt11:20-Matt11:24); [13:10–15](https://ref.ly/Matt13:10-Matt13:15); [23:37–39](https://ref.ly/Matt23:37-Matt23:39); [24:1–36](https://ref.ly/Matt24:1-Matt24:36)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 10:14

## Matthew 10:15 (id: 21659)

* God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah because of their evil actions ([Genesis 18:16–19:29](https://ref.ly/Gen18:16-Gen19:29)). With the fuller revelation through Jesus Christ, a town that rejected the disciples' message would receive a more severe judgment.

* *that town*: A whole village or city is responsible when most people reject the message (see [Acts 13:45–47](https://ref.ly/Acts13:45-Acts13:47), [50–51](https://ref.ly/Acts13:50-Acts13:51); [14:1–7](https://ref.ly/Acts14:1-Acts14:7)). But God will save individuals who trust in him (for example, Lot; see [Genesis 19:1–29](https://ref.ly/Gen19:1-Gen19:29); [2 Peter 2:6–9](https://ref.ly/2Pet2:6-2Pet2:9)).

## Matthew 10:19–20 (id: 21661)

Just as God gave Moses a spokesman in Aaron ([Exodus 4:10–17](https://ref.ly/Exod4:10-Exod4:17)), God would also give Jesus disciples the right words at the right time through the Spirit ([John 14:26](https://ref.ly/John14:26); [Acts 4:8](https://ref.ly/Acts4:8)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 10:19–MAT 10:20

## Matthew 10:21–22 (id: 21664)

* Jewish people often connected family conflict with the end times (see [Matthew 24:9–10](https://ref.ly/Matt24:9-Matt24:10)). Jesus himself went through such conflict ([12:46–50](https://ref.ly/Matt12:46-Matt12:50)).
* The *one who perseveres to the end* means those who stay loyal to Jesus, even to death or until he returns ([10:23](https://ref.ly/Matt10:23)).
* *will be saved*: Some interpret this as being freed from persecution, like release from prison. But here it refers to eternal salvation for those who stay faithful.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 10:21–MAT 10:22

## Matthew 10:23 (id: 21665)

* *before the Son of Man comes*: Scholars disagree on whether this refers to Christ's second coming for his church or an earlier judgment, specifically the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70 (see [16:28](https://ref.ly/Matt16:28)).
* *you will not reach*: Jesus might mean “before you have *fled* through all the towns” or “before you have *spread the gospel* in all the towns.” The focus on persecution in the context (see [10:17–39](https://ref.ly/Matt10:17-Matt10:39)) supports the first idea. It suggests the towns were like cities of refuge ([Numbers 35:9–32](https://ref.ly/Num35:9-Num35:32)). This emphasizes how widely they will reject the message. It means “not until the whole nation has expelled you.”

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 10:23

## Matthew 10:25 (id: 21666)

In the time of Jesus, people often called Satan "the prince of demons." The Greek word used is *Beelzeboul*, which comes from the name of an Old Testament pagan god, Baal\-zebul (“lord, the prince”). In the Latin Bible, the name appears as *Beelzebub*. This form reflects a Hebrew phrase meaning “lord of flies.” It was likely a Jewish insult against Baal\-zebul (see [2 Kings 1:2](https://ref.ly/2Kgs1:2)).

God accepts those who publicly acknowledge Jesus in times of trial and persecution ([Matthew 10:16–25](https://ref.ly/Matt10:16-Matt10:25)). These verses describe a person’s overall way of life, not just a single confession or denial (see [7:13–27](https://ref.ly/Matt7:13-Matt7:27)). For example, Judas sometimes acknowledged Jesus but was still condemned ([26:23–24](https://ref.ly/Matt26:23-Matt26:24)). Peter denied Jesus (see [26:69–75](https://ref.ly/Matt26:69-Matt26:75)), but he was restored and saved.

Jesus did bring peace ([John 14:27](https://ref.ly/John14:27)), but not the kind of social or political peace people often expect. Instead, he called people to make a decision about him. This decision would bring a sword, meaning division, even within families (see [Matt 8:21–22](https://ref.ly/Matt8:21-Matt8:22); [12:46–50](https://ref.ly/Matt12:46-Matt12:50); [Luke 12:51](https://ref.ly/Luke12:51)).

The cross was a tool used by the Romans for torture and execution ([Matthew 27:27–55](https://ref.ly/Matt27:27-Matt27:55)). To *take up your cross and follow* Jesus means loving him more than anything else. It also means being ready to obey him, no matter the physical or social consequences.

* *a righteous man*: This is someone who follows God’s law as taught by John the Baptist ([Matthew 21:32](https://ref.ly/Matt21:32)) and Jesus (see [3:15](https://ref.ly/Matt3:15)). This is why God approves of them ([13:43](https://ref.ly/Matt13:43), [49](https://ref.ly/Matt13:49); [25:37–46](https://ref.ly/Matt25:37-Matt25:46)).

## Matthew 10:42 (id: 21676)

*One of these little ones:* Thisprobably refers to the low social status of most of the disciples of Jesus (see [Matthew 5:3](https://ref.ly/Matt5:3); [18:1–5](https://ref.ly/Matt18:1-Matt18:5) and [6:5](https://ref.ly/Matt6:5); [23:5–12](https://ref.ly/Matt23:5-Matt23:12)).

## Matthew 11:2 (id: 21698)

* Herod Antipas arrested John ([Matthew 4:12](https://ref.ly/Matt4:12)) because John criticized Herod's immoral relationship with Herodias, the wife of his half\-brother ([14:1–12](https://ref.ly/Matt14:1-Matt14:12)).

* *the works of Christ*: These actions showed that Jesus is the Messiah (Christ) ([8:1–9:34](https://ref.ly/Matt8:1-Matt9:34)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 11:2

## Matthew 11:2–19 (id: 21688)

This section starts with John the Baptist’s doubt. It ends by honoring his faith and his work ([Matthew 11:7–19](https://ref.ly/Matt11:7-Matt11:19)). The people's rejection of John ([11:16–19](https://ref.ly/Matt11:16-Matt11:19)) hints at their future rejection of Jesus.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 11:2–MAT 11:19

## Matthew 11:2–20.34 (id: 21689)

This section focuses on two main reactions to Jesus: acceptance and rejection. The first part ([Matthew 11:2–12:50](https://ref.ly/Matt11:2-Matt12:50)) shows Jewish leaders rejecting Jesus, while his disciples are learning to understand and accept him.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 11:2

## Matthew 11:5 (id: 21699)

The miracles of compassion that Jesus did showed that the kingdom of God had begun (see [12:28](https://ref.ly/Matt12:28); [Isaiah 29:18–19](https://ref.ly/Isa29:18-Isa29:19); [35:5–6](https://ref.ly/Isa35:5-Isa35:6); [61:1](https://ref.ly/Isa61:1)). Jesus expected John to realize he was fulfilling Old Testament prophecies.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 11:5

## Matthew 11:6 (id: 21700)

*Who does not fall away on account of Me*: Jesus intended that the works mentioned in [verse 5](https://ref.ly/Matt11:5) were meant to help John the Baptist and his disciples decide about Jesus. But Jesus knew that some unexpected parts of his ministry would cause people to reject him.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 11:6

## Matthew 11:7 (id: 21701)

*A reed swaying in the wind*: This refers to an unstable person. The implied answer to this rhetorical question is "no."

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 11:7

## Matthew 11:11 (id: 21683)

John the Baptist was the greatest person ever to have lived. Yet the least of the followers of Jesus are greater than John because they live in the new covenant of salvation through Jesus (see [4:17](https://ref.ly/Matt4:17)). The new covenant refers to God's new agreement with people that came through Jesus. Salvation (being saved from sin and its consequences) comes through death and resurrection of Jesus.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 11:11

## Matthew 11:12 (id: 21684)

* *The kingdom of heaven has been subject to violence*: The Greek verb can mean either that the kingdom suffers violence (negative) or that it forcefully advances (positive). In [Luke 16:16](https://ref.ly/Luke16:16), a different verb (“preached”) makes the statement clearly positive.
* *the violent lay claim to it*: This phrase can also have either a negative or positive sense. Negatively, it may point to those who opposed John (see [Matthew 11:2](https://ref.ly/Matt11:2); [14:1–12](https://ref.ly/Matt14:1-Matt14:12)) and persecuted the kingdom’s messengers. Positively, it may refer to people “forcing their way in” (see [Luke 16:16](https://ref.ly/Luke16:16)), urgently pressing into the kingdom through radical trust and obedience.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 11:12

## Matthew 11:14–15 (id: 21685)

*He is the Elijah who was to come:* John fulfills the Old Testament prophecy about the prophet Elijah's return ([Matthew 17:10–13](https://ref.ly/Matt17:10-Matt17:13); see [Malachi 4:5](https://ref.ly/Mal4:5)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 11:14–MAT 11:15

## Matthew 11:16–19 (id: 21686)

John’s message was like funeral songs. He lived with strict self\-denial, fasting often and not drinking wine ([Matthew 11:18](https://ref.ly/Matt11:18); see [3:4](https://ref.ly/Matt3:4)). The message of Jesus is more like wedding songs, with feasting and drinking (see [9:9–17](https://ref.ly/Matt9:9-Matt9:17)). In both cases, the people of this time respond to God's messenger with indifference and rejection.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 11:16–MAT 11:19

## Matthew 11:18–19 (id: 21687)

Here Jesus describes how both John and he himself offended the people of that generation.

John lived in the wilderness, eating locusts and honey ([Matthew 3:1](https://ref.ly/Matt3:1), [4](https://ref.ly/Matt3:4)). People accused him of having a demon. 

Jesus, by contrast, ate and drank freely with others. People accused him of being like a rebellious son (see [Deuteronomy 21:18–21](https://ref.ly/Deut21:18-Deut21:21)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 11:18–MAT 11:19

## Matthew 11:20–24 (id: 21690)

The miracles Jesus performed showed he was the Messiah ([Matthew 11:5–6](https://ref.ly/Matt11:5-Matt11:6)). These miracles demanded people to repent ([11:20](https://ref.ly/Matt11:20)). Those who rejected the Messiah faced great judgment, because Jesus had clearly shown who he is.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 11:20–MAT 11:24

## Matthew 11:21–24 (id: 21691)

As Jesus traveled through the villages of Galilee (Korazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum) he revealed more of himself to the people. Because of this greater revelation, their refusal to listen brought a more severe judgment. Jesus compared their judgment to that of the pagan cities Tyre ([Isaiah 23](https://ref.ly/Isa23:1-Isa23:18); [Ezekiel 26:1–28:19](https://ref.ly/Ezek26:1-Ezek28:19)), Sidon ([Ezekiel 28:20–23](https://ref.ly/Ezek28:20-Ezek28:23)), and Sodom ([Genesis 18:22–19:29](https://ref.ly/Gen18:22-Gen19:29)).

## Matthew 11:25 (id: 21694)

*The wise and learned*: The Pharisees and teachers of religious law thought their access to God was guaranteed through their knowledge and practice of the law. The disciples of Jesus were more childlike (see [Matthew 21:15–16](https://ref.ly/Matt21:15-Matt21:16)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 11:25

## Matthew 11:25–30 (id: 21693)

This passage is about the small group of people who accept the Messiah and follow his teachings, even though most of their generation does not.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 11:25–MAT 11:30

## Matthew 11:27 (id: 21695)

Jesus showed his close relationship with the Father. Everything he said and did came from his unity with his Father (see [John 10:14–15](https://ref.ly/John10:14-John10:15); [14:6–7](https://ref.ly/John14:6-John14:7); [15:23–24](https://ref.ly/John15:23-John15:24); [16:15](https://ref.ly/John16:15); [17:25–26](https://ref.ly/John17:25-John17:26)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 11:27

## Matthew 11:28 (id: 21696)

* The heavy burdens were probably caused by the legal demands of the religious teachers and Pharisees (see [Matthew 23:4](https://ref.ly/Matt23:4)).

* *rest*: This means spiritual refreshment, either now or in the future (compare [1:21](https://ref.ly/Matt1:21); [Hebrews 4:8–11](https://ref.ly/Heb4:8-Heb4:11)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 11:28

## Matthew 11:29–30 (id: 21697)

A *yoke*, which connects two animals, symbolizes the demands of being a disciple of Jesus. Unlike the "yoke" of religious leaders, the yoke of Jesus is *easy* and *light*. This is not because it demands less of a person (see [7:13–14](https://ref.ly/Matt7:13-Matt7:14)). But it is because the Messiah's power through the Holy Spirit makes it possible (see [Acts 15:10](https://ref.ly/Acts15:10); [1 John 5:3](https://ref.ly/1John5:3)). 

Israel's spiritual leaders imposed religious demands (see [Matthew 23:4](https://ref.ly/Matt23:4); [Acts 15:10](https://ref.ly/Acts15:10)). This included 613 Old Testament commands and added traditions. Jesus urged those burdened by the Pharisees' rules to come to him (see [Matthew 11:28](https://ref.ly/Matt11:28)) to find the salvation for which they deeply longed. This call to salvation involves living obediently to the new teachings of Jesus. Jesus invites people to build a relationship with a humble and gentle teacher.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 11:29–MAT 11:30

## Matthew 12:1 (id: 21708)

*The Sabbath* was the seventh day of the week. God intended it to be a day of complete rest according to Old Testament laws ([Genesis 2:2–3](https://ref.ly/Gen2:2-Gen2:3); [Exodus 20:8–11](https://ref.ly/Exod20:8-Exod20:11)). Christ fulfills the Sabbath (compare [Hebrews 4:1–11](https://ref.ly/Heb4:1-Heb4:11)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 12:1

## Matthew 12:1–8 (id: 21703)

This exchange shows the Pharisees' lack of compassion as they placed a heavy burden on others ([Matthew 11:29–30](https://ref.ly/Matt11:29-Matt11:30)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 12:1–MAT 12:8

## Matthew 12:1–14 (id: 21702)

Matthew closely connects the offer of rest Jesus gives ([Matthew 11:28–30](https://ref.ly/Matt11:28-Matt11:30)) with a discussion about the Sabbath. The rest Jesus offers liberates people from human traditions about the Sabbath (see [Hebrews 4:1–11](https://ref.ly/Heb4:1-Heb4:11)). The Pharisees rejected Jesus because they had a commitment to their tradition.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 12:1–MAT 12:14

## Matthew 12:3–4 (id: 21717)

Sometimes it was right to suspend ceremonial laws ([1 Samuel 21:1–6](https://ref.ly/1Sam21:1-1Sam21:6)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 12:3–MAT 12:4

## Matthew 12:3–7 (id: 21718)

The Pharisees did not understand that God designed the Sabbath to benefit people. They made it a heavy burden instead.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 12:3–MAT 12:7

## Matthew 12:5–6 (id: 21730)

Priests worked on the Sabbath ([Leviticus 24:8–9](https://ref.ly/Lev24:8-Lev24:9); [Numbers 28:9–10](https://ref.ly/Num28:9-Num28:10)), and the Pharisees did not find this offensive. If the priests’ work for the temple on the Sabbath is allowed, then certainly Jesus can do the same because he is greater than the temple (see [Matthew 4:23](https://ref.ly/Matt4:23); [9:35](https://ref.ly/Matt9:35); [11:2–6](https://ref.ly/Matt11:2-Matt11:6), [20–30](https://ref.ly/Matt11:20-Matt11:30)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 12:5–MAT 12:6

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 12:9–MAT 12:14

## Matthew 12:10 (id: 21704)

*Is it lawful*: Jewish teachers of the law said healing on the Sabbath was allowed only if someone’s life was in danger. Because the person’s life was not in danger, the Pharisees believed that healing was not allowed.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 12:10

## Matthew 12:11–12 (id: 21705)

They rescued animals but ignored people, which was inconsistent.

## Matthew 12:18 (id: 21707)

* This quote is similar to the story of the baptism of Jesus ([Matthew 3:13–17](https://ref.ly/Matt3:13-Matt3:17)).

* *Justice* (or *judgment*): This can be good or bad. Here, it probably means something positive ([12:20](https://ref.ly/Matt12:20); compare [23:23](https://ref.ly/Matt23:23)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 12:18

## Matthew 12:20 (id: 21709)

Jesus does not add to people’s spiritual burdens. Instead, he gives them forgiveness with compassion and the sustenance (nourishment and strength) they need (see [Matthew 11:28–30](https://ref.ly/Matt11:28-Matt11:30); [12:1–14](https://ref.ly/Matt12:1-Matt12:14)).

## Matthew 12:26 (id: 21713)

Jesus said in essence, “If I drive out demons by the power of Satan, then Satan is fighting against his own kingdom. That would be foolish for him to do.”

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 12:26

## Matthew 12:27 (id: 21714)

*your sons*: Jesus forced them to think consistently. If Satan's power casts out demons, then the disciples of the Pharisees were just as guilty, since they too cast out demons (see [Acts 19:13–16](https://ref.ly/Acts19:13-Acts19:16)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 12:27

## Matthew 12:28 (id: 21715)

The Pharisees were confronted with the kingdom of God and chose to reject it (see [Luke 17:20–21](https://ref.ly/Luke17:20-Luke17:21); [1 John 3:8](https://ref.ly/1John3:8)). Through his miracles, Jesus showed the power of the kingdom in the present world. But the kingdom will reach its full completion when Christ comes again.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 12:28

## Matthew 12:29 (id: 21716)

* This parable forced the Pharisees to answer a simple question. Can anyone drive out demons without first controlling Satan's powers and opposing him (see [Isaiah 49:24–26](https://ref.ly/Isa49:24-Isa49:26); [53:12](https://ref.ly/Isa53:12))?

* *ties up the strong man*: This points to how Jesus defeated Satan. He overcame him in the wilderness temptation ([Matthew 4:1–11](https://ref.ly/Matt4:1-Matt4:11)), continued to overcome him throughout his ministry (see [Luke 10:17–20](https://ref.ly/Luke10:17-Luke10:20)), and won the final victory at the cross (see [Colossians 2:14–15](https://ref.ly/Col2:14-Col2:15)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 12:29

## Matthew 12:31 (id: 21719)

The Pharisees accused Jesus of being under the influence of Satan. Jesus explained that he, as the Messiah, cast out demons through the power of the Holy Spirit. In this context, blasphemy against the Holy Spirit can only mean attributing the ministry and exorcisms of Jesus to Satan’s power.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 12:31

## Matthew 12:32 (id: 21720)

God can forgive people who are confused about Jesus calling himself the "Son of Man." But, God will not forgive a person that says the Holy Spirit's work comes from Satan. Today, this is like completely rejecting the conviction of the Holy Spirit about Jesus. This refers to when an unbeliever ultimately rejects the good news about Jesus (see [Hebrews 6:4–6](https://ref.ly/Heb6:4-Heb6:6); [1 John 5:16–21](https://ref.ly/1John5:16-1John5:21)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 12:32

## Matthew 12:33–37 (id: 21721)

Jesus addressed the main issue. The Pharisees did not accept him or believe his work came from God because they were wicked (see [7:15–27](https://ref.ly/Matt7:15-Matt7:27)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 12:33–MAT 12:37

## Matthew 12:36–37 (id: 21722)

* The *careless word*, in this context, was the claim that demons empowered Jesus.
* What a person says will either free or condemn them on the day of judgment. What people say shows the true state of their hearts.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 12:36–MAT 12:37

## Matthew 12:38 (id: 21723)

*See a sign*: People expected the Messiah to perform amazing miracles. This expectation was probably inspired by stories about Moses ([Exodus 4:1–9](https://ref.ly/Exod4:1-Exod4:9); see also [Isaiah 7:11](https://ref.ly/Isa7:11), [14](https://ref.ly/Isa7:14); [38:7–8](https://ref.ly/Isa38:7-Isa38:8)). They believed the Messiah would show these miracles on demand (see [Matthew 16:1–4](https://ref.ly/Matt16:1-Matt16:4); [Luke 23:8](https://ref.ly/Luke23:8); [John 2:18](https://ref.ly/John2:18); [4:48](https://ref.ly/John4:48); [6:30](https://ref.ly/John6:30); [7:31](https://ref.ly/John7:31); [9:16](https://ref.ly/John9:16); [11:47](https://ref.ly/John11:47); [1 Corinthians 1:22](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:22)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 12:38

## Matthew 12:39–40 (id: 21724)

* To demand a sign shows a lack of faith.

* The sign of the prophet Jonah was his "resurrection" from the large fish after three days and nights. It also referred to his preaching ([12:41](https://ref.ly/Matt12:41); [Luke 11:32](https://ref.ly/Luke11:32)). This was similar to the burial, resurrection, and preaching of Jesus. Jesus compared Jonah's experience to what he would experience. He was not predicting the exact timing of his death and resurrection.
* *Heart of the earth* is another way of saying "the grave."

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 12:39–MAT 12:40

## Matthew 12:41–42 (id: 21725)

*One greater*: Jesus is greater than the temple ([Matthew 12:6](https://ref.ly/Matt12:6)), the prophet Jonah, and King Solomon. So, rejecting him brings more severe judgment on this "wicked and adulterous generation" ([12:39](https://ref.ly/Matt12:39)).

## Matthew 12:43–45 (id: 21727)

The Messiah came in victory over evil spirits. But instead of turning back to God, the nation as a whole rejected him. Jesus said that when an evil spirit is cast out, it may return if the person is not ready to resist it. In the same way, judgment would come on this evil generation because they rejected the Messiah (God’s chosen one).

Those who are true members in the family of Jesus obey the will of God. They show this obedience by obeying the commands of Jesus (see [Matthew 7:21](https://ref.ly/Matt7:21)). Obedience does not earn entrance into this family, but a person cannot be a member of this family if they do not obey him (see [3:15](https://ref.ly/Matt3:15); [5:17–48](https://ref.ly/Matt5:17-Matt5:48); [6:10](https://ref.ly/Matt6:10), [12](https://ref.ly/Matt6:12); [7:13–27](https://ref.ly/Matt7:13-Matt7:27); [21:31](https://ref.ly/Matt21:31)).

In the third major speech recorded by Matthew (see study note on Matthew 5:1–7:29), Jesus here recognized the separation of his followers from others ([Matthew 13:14](https://ref.ly/Matt13:14),[16](https://ref.ly/Matt13:16)). He began to reveal the secrets of the kingdom of heaven privately to them through parables.

* This parable (explained in [Matthew 13:18–23](https://ref.ly/Matt13:18-Matt13:23)) discusses the mostly negative reactions of the Jewish people to Jesus and his message.

* *Parables* (Greek *parabolē*): These are stories that use everyday life to explain a spiritual truth. To understand a parable, find the main comparison (analogy) and consider its historical and gospel context. Then a person can understand the main message. Avoid finding unintended symbolic meanings in every part of a parable.

## Matthew 13:10 (id: 21736)

* From this point on, Jesus rarely taught the general public. Instead, he focused on teaching those who had committed themselves to him ([Matthew 13:1–20:34](https://ref.ly/Matt13:1-Matt20:34)). But he would once again confront Israel ([21:1–23:39](https://ref.ly/Matt21:1-Matt23:39)).

* *The people* were the unbelieving opponents mentioned again in [13:11](https://ref.ly/Matt13:11) (“them”) and [13:12](https://ref.ly/Matt13:12) (“whoever does not have”).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 13:10

## Matthew 13:11 (id: 21738)

* *The knowledge … has been given to you:* God allowed the disciples to understand the importance of Jesus. God also allowed them to respond to the message of Jesus about the kingdom of heaven with faith and obedience (see [13:19](https://ref.ly/Matt13:19), [23](https://ref.ly/Matt13:23)).

* *the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven*: Salvation is available through Jesus as the fulfillment of Old Testament promises.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 13:11

## Matthew 13:11–15 (id: 21737)

Jesus answered the disciples question in [verse 10](https://ref.ly/Matt13:10). He told them that the Jews' stubborn disbelief and rejection of him brought God's condemnation.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 13:11–MAT 13:15

## Matthew 13:13 (id: 21739)

* Jesus told parables, and those who believed him understood them. Yet, those who rejected Jesus found that his parables increased their disbelief.

* *Though seeing, they do not see … hear or understand:* They lacked the faith to recognize the truth ([Matthew 13:19](https://ref.ly/Matt13:19), [23](https://ref.ly/Matt13:23)) and respond ([Mark 8:18](https://ref.ly/Mark8:18); [John 12:40](https://ref.ly/John12:40); see also [Jeremiah 5:21](https://ref.ly/Jer5:21)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 13:13

## Matthew 13:14–15 (id: 21740)

Similar to the message of the prophet Isaiah, the message of Jesus has two effects:

1. It judges those who do not believe or obey, and
2. it creates a small group of faithful people who do the Lord's will ([Matthew 21:43](https://ref.ly/Matt21:43)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 13:14–MAT 13:15

## Matthew 13:16–17 (id: 21741)

Jesus fulfilled what the prophets and Old Testament believers wanted to see and hear. He fulfills the Old Testament promises (see [Isaiah 52:15](https://ref.ly/Isa52:15); [John 8:56](https://ref.ly/John8:56); [1 Peter 1:10](https://ref.ly/1Pet1:10)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 13:16–MAT 13:17

## Matthew 13:19 (id: 21742)

*Does not understand it*: Responding to God's message directly relates to understanding its importance.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 13:19

## Matthew 13:20–21 (id: 21743)

*Has no root, he remains for only a season*: The issue is a lack of enduring faith and obedience (see [Matthew 7:13–27](https://ref.ly/Matt7:13-Matt7:27); [10:22](https://ref.ly/Matt10:22)), especially when confronted by persecution.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 13:20–MAT 13:21

## Matthew 13:22 (id: 21744)

Jesus talked about the competing demands in life (see also [Matthew 8:18–22](https://ref.ly/Matt8:18-Matt8:22)). The worries of life can become overwhelming and lead people away from faithful obedience (see [6:19–34](https://ref.ly/Matt6:19-Matt6:34)). The temptation of wealth, especially its deceptive nature, is a common theme in Matthew (for example, [4:8–10](https://ref.ly/Matt4:8-Matt4:10); [6:24](https://ref.ly/Matt6:24); [13:44–45](https://ref.ly/Matt13:44-Matt13:45)). God values faith, obedience, and helping those in need more than wealth (for example, [19:21](https://ref.ly/Matt19:21); [25:31–46](https://ref.ly/Matt25:31-Matt25:46)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 13:22

## Matthew 13:23 (id: 21745)

*Produces a crop*: This probably refers to faithfully obeying the commands of Jesus (for example, [Matthew 5:1–7:27](https://ref.ly/Matt5:1-Matt7:27); [28:20](https://ref.ly/Matt28:20)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 13:23

## Matthew 13:24–30 (id: 21746)

[Matthew 13:36–43](https://ref.ly/Matt13:36-Matt13:43) explains this story.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 13:24–MAT 13:30

## Matthew 13:25 (id: 21747)

*Weeds*, also known as *tares* or bearded darnel, look a lot like wheat. Farmers waited until the plants grew to tell them apart. Intentionally contaminating crops like this was against the law.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 13:25

## Matthew 13:28–30 (id: 21748)

Jesus rebuked the sons of Zebedee for wanting to destroy villages that did not believe in him ([Luke 9:54–55](https://ref.ly/Luke9:54-Luke9:55)). He told his disciples not to seek revenge against enemies. Judgment is God's responsibility (see [Matthew 7:1–5](https://ref.ly/Matt7:1-Matt7:5)). Jesus urges his disciples to wait patiently for God's righteous judgment ("the harvest"; see [Luke 13:6–9](https://ref.ly/Luke13:6-Luke13:9)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 13:28–MAT 13:30

## Matthew 13:31–33 (id: 21750)

Jesus used surprising and vivid images in these parables. He probably wanted to show how the kingdom of Heaven would grow through preaching the good news. More probably, he wanted to highlight the contrast between small beginnings and a glorious end. He also encouraged the disciples to be patient (see also [Matthew 16:24–17:13](https://ref.ly/Matt16:24-Matt17:13)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 13:31–MAT 13:33

## Matthew 13:33 (id: 21751)

Usually, yeast refers to the influence of evil (for example, [16:6](https://ref.ly/Matt16:6); [1 Corinthians 5:6](https://ref.ly/1Cor5:6); [Galatians 5:9](https://ref.ly/Gal5:9)). But in this context it represents the positive and widespread influence of the kingdom of Heaven.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 13:33

## Matthew 13:34–35 (id: 21752)

Even the way Jesus taught fulfilled prophecies from the Old Testament. [Psalm 78:2–3](https://ref.ly/Ps78:2-Ps78:3) talks about sharing the history of God's revelation with future generations. What Jesus revealed in his teachings are the most important part of that history ([Matthew 13:10–17](https://ref.ly/Matt13:10-Matt13:17); [1 Corinthians 2:7](https://ref.ly/1Cor2:7)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 13:34–MAT 13:35

## Matthew 13:36 (id: 21754)

* They *went into the house* (see [Matthew 13:1](https://ref.ly/Matt13:1)). Jesus taught in public using parables, but he explained their meanings privately to his disciples.
* *Explain*: The disciples had the special opportunity to learn the secrets of the kingdom ([13:11–17](https://ref.ly/Matt13:11-Matt13:17)). But they did not understand the parables until Jesus explained them.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 13:36

## Matthew 13:36–43 (id: 21753)

These verses explain the parable from [Matthew 13:24–30](https://ref.ly/Matt13:24-Matt13:30). The people of the kingdom (like wheat) live side by side with those who do not belong to it (like weeds). The “field” is the world, and this will continue until the end of history. 

The mystery of the kingdom is that it is already present in the world, but God has not yet removed the wicked in judgment. The disciples of Jesus must learn patience and trust God’s timing.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 13:36–MAT 13:43

## Matthew 13:38 (id: 21755)

* *The field is the world*: The kingdom of heaven includes all nations ([Matthew 28:16–20](https://ref.ly/Matt28:16-Matt28:20)).
* The *sons of the kingdom* are those who obey Jesus ([13:11–17](https://ref.ly/Matt13:11-Matt13:17), [23](https://ref.ly/Matt13:23); [21:43](https://ref.ly/Matt21:43)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 13:38

## Matthew 13:40–42 (id: 21756)

The harvest of judgment, which began with the first coming of the Son of Man ([Matthew 3:12](https://ref.ly/Matt3:12)) will be completed when he returns ([Revelation 14:14–16](https://ref.ly/Rev14:14-Rev14:16)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 13:40–MAT 13:42

## Matthew 13:41 (id: 21757)

*His kingdom*: The rule of the Son of Man will be visible over everything at the "end of the age" ([Matthew 13:40](https://ref.ly/Matt13:40)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 13:41

## Matthew 13:43 (id: 21758)

The righteous people will obey God's will as Jesus showed, unlike those "who practice lawlessness" ([Matthew 13:41](https://ref.ly/Matt13:41)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 13:43

## Matthew 13:44 (id: 21760)

* *Treasure hidden in a field*: People buried treasures to protect them from thieves and military enemies ([Matthew 25:25](https://ref.ly/Matt25:25)).

* *in his joy*: Those who find the kingdom of heaven experience more joy from it than any temporary pleasure can offer (see [1 Peter 1:8](https://ref.ly/1Pet1:8)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 13:44

## Matthew 13:44–46 (id: 21759)

Another mystery of the kingdom of heaven ([13:11](https://ref.ly/Matt13:11)) is that it is more valuable than any treasure. So, a person should give up everything to get it (see [19:21](https://ref.ly/Matt19:21), [29](https://ref.ly/Matt19:29); [Philippians 3:7](https://ref.ly/Phil3:7)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 13:44–MAT 13:46

## Matthew 13:47–50 (id: 21761)

This parable is about God's judgment on the last day ([Matthew 25:31–46](https://ref.ly/Matt25:31-Matt25:46)). Then he will forever separate the wicked from the righteous. This warning emphasizes the importance of the two earlier invitations to make a decision to trust Jesus.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 13:47–MAT 13:50

## Matthew 13:49 (id: 21762)

The wicked are people who do not obey God's will revealed by Jesus. The righteous are those who obey God's will (see [Matthew 5:21–48](https://ref.ly/Matt5:21-Matt5:48); [6:1](https://ref.ly/Matt6:1), [33](https://ref.ly/Matt6:33); [7:13–27](https://ref.ly/Matt7:13-Matt7:27); [12:33–37](https://ref.ly/Matt12:33-Matt12:37); [16:27](https://ref.ly/Matt16:27)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 13:49

## Matthew 13:51 (id: 21763)

Understanding the secrets of the kingdom of heaven is a gift from God ([Matthew 13:10–17](https://ref.ly/Matt13:10-Matt13:17), [23](https://ref.ly/Matt13:23)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 13:51

## Matthew 13:52 (id: 21764)

* A teacher of religious law who becomes a disciple in the kingdom of God changes allegiance. He now looks to Jesus as the way of salvation.

* *new treasures as well as old*: This order shows that the new covenant brought by Jesus takes first place. It is greater than the old covenant that God gave through Abraham and Moses ([Matthew 5:17–20](https://ref.ly/Matt5:17-Matt5:20); [19:16–22](https://ref.ly/Matt19:16-Matt19:22)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 13:52

## Matthew 13:54–58 (id: 21765)

That Jesus was rejected at home is part of the ongoing theme of the Messiah’s rejection by his own people (see chapter [Matthew 12](https://ref.ly/Matt12:1-Matt12:50); [15:1–20](https://ref.ly/Matt15:1-Matt15:20); [16:1–12](https://ref.ly/Matt16:1-Matt16:12)).

They felt very insulted. Focusing on the ordinary social status of Jesus ([John 6:42](https://ref.ly/John6:42)), they missed his unique importance.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 13:57

## Matthew 13:58 (id: 21768)

To understand the message of Jesus ([13:10–17](https://ref.ly/Matt13:10-Matt13:17)) and experience his miracles, you need faith.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 13:58

## Matthew 14:1 (id: 21770)

Herod Antipas’s official title was *tetrarch*, which means a ruler of a fourth part of a kingdom. He ruled Galilee and Perea from 4 BC to AD 39 (see [Matthew 2:19–22](https://ref.ly/Matt2:19-Matt2:22)). Jesus called Antipas “that fox” ([Luke 13:32](https://ref.ly/Luke13:32)). John the Baptist rightly condemned him for adultery ([Matthew 14:3–12](https://ref.ly/Matt14:3-Matt14:12); [Luke 3:19–20](https://ref.ly/Luke3:19-Luke3:20)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 14:1

## Matthew 14:2 (id: 21777)

People were saying that John had been resurrected from the dead (see [16:14](https://ref.ly/Matt16:14)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 14:2

## Matthew 14:3–12 (id: 21778)

John the Baptist’s message drew large crowds, which leaders saw as a political threat (see Josephus, *Antiquities* 18\.5\.2\). Years after John was executed, many Jews believed that Herod’s military defeat by King Aretas in AD 36 was God’s judgment for killing an innocent man.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 14:3–MAT 14:12

## Matthew 14:4 (id: 21780)

John kept warning Herod about his sin (see [Leviticus 18:6](https://ref.ly/Lev18:6); [20:21](https://ref.ly/Lev20:21)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 14:4

Herod Antipas often made extravagant and foolish promises.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 14:7

In ancient times, presenting a head on a tray was a known practice (see Josephus, *Antiquities* 13\.4\.8; 14\.15\.13; 18\.5\.1; 20\.5\.1\).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 14:8

## Matthew 14:13–21 (id: 21769)

What Jesus did consistently fulfilled Old Testament promises about the kingdom of heaven and the Messiah ([Matthew 11:5–6](https://ref.ly/Matt11:5-Matt11:6); [12:28](https://ref.ly/Matt12:28)). Here, Jesus reminded people of God's gift of *manna* to the Israelites ([Exodus 16](https://ref.ly/Exod16:1-Exod16:36); see [John 6:32](https://ref.ly/John6:32)). This showed that he is the promised prophet of the end times (see [Deuteronomy 18:15–16](https://ref.ly/Deut18:15-Deut18:16)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 14:13–MAT 14:21

## Matthew 14:22 (id: 21773)

After Jesus miraculously fed the crowd, they wanted to make him king ([John 6:15](https://ref.ly/John6:15)). He withdrew from the crowd because it was not the right time.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 14:22

## Matthew 14:22–33 (id: 21772)

Jesus showed his power over nature, giving the disciples a chance to trust him as the Son of God ([Mathhew 14:33](https://ref.ly/Matt14:33); see also [8:23–27](https://ref.ly/Matt8:23-Matt8:27); [Psalm 8:6](https://ref.ly/Ps8:6); [Hebrews 2:8–9](https://ref.ly/Heb2:8-Heb2:9)).

## Matthew 15:1 (id: 21787)

The temple was in Jerusalem, which made it the center of authority in Judaism. This gave these ambassadors from the Pharisees and scribes more influence in their discussions with Jesus.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 15:1

## Matthew 15:1–20 (id: 21784)

Jesus accused the Pharisees of disobeying God's law because of their focus on preserving traditions.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 15:1–MAT 15:20

## Matthew 15:2 (id: 21793)

* Jewish teachers developed long\-standing traditions to explain how the written Torah should guide daily life. These traditions were memorized and passed from teacher to student by word of mouth(see [1 Corinthians 11:23](https://ref.ly/1Cor11:23); [15:1–5](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:1-1Cor15:5)).
* *break the tradition of* … *wash their hands* (see [Mark 7:2–4](https://ref.ly/Mark7:2-Mark7:4); [Luke 11:38](https://ref.ly/Luke11:38)): The tradition of hand washing was seen as important. Ignoring this practice was considered disobedience to the Torah and unfaithfulness to God’s will for Israel (see [Matthew 23:25–26](https://ref.ly/Matt23:25-Matt23:26)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 15:2

## Matthew 15:5 (id: 21796)

*A gift devoted to God*: The people would probably donate a gift like this at the temple (see [Mark 7:11](https://ref.ly/Mark7:11); see also [Proverbs 28:24](https://ref.ly/Prov28:24)) but it served as a way to avoid financially providing for one's parents.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 15:5

## Matthew 15:11 (id: 21785)

* *What enters his mouth*: Jesus may have been speaking about foods that the law did not allow (such as pork or shellfish) or food made unclean by unwashed hands ([Matthew 15:20](https://ref.ly/Matt15:20)).
* What makes a person *defiled* also makes them unfit to be with God. Jesus moved the focus from outward rules of purity to the true purity of the heart (see [15:18–19](https://ref.ly/Matt15:18-Matt15:19); [23:25–26](https://ref.ly/Matt23:25-Matt23:26); [Acts 10:1–48](https://ref.ly/Acts10:1-Acts10:48); [Romans 14:14](https://ref.ly/Rom14:14)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 15:13

## Matthew 15:21–28 (id: 21788)

This encounter brings up another debated issue. It is about whether Gentiles (non\-Jews) can share in the kingdom of the Messiah (see [Matthew 8:11](https://ref.ly/Matt8:11)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 15:21–MAT 15:28

## Matthew 15:22 (id: 21789)

* *Canaanite woman:* Matthew uses this old expression to describe the woman as a pagan.
* *Lord, Son of David*: The woman seemed to understand that Jesus was the Messiah (see [Matthew 1:1](https://ref.ly/Matt1:1); [9:27](https://ref.ly/Matt9:27); [17:15](https://ref.ly/Matt17:15); [20:30](https://ref.ly/Matt20:30)).

## Matthew 15:23 (id: 21790)

*Did not answer a word*: Jesus stayed silent to test the woman's faith ([Matthew 5:28](https://ref.ly/Matt15:28); compare [8:24](https://ref.ly/Matt8:24); [14:16](https://ref.ly/Matt14:16)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 15:23

## Matthew 15:26 (id: 21791)

Jews often referred to pagans as *dogs*, which were considered ceremonially unclean ([Leviticus 11:27](https://ref.ly/Lev11:27)). When Jesus spoke to the woman, he was speaking of her condition as a gentile. She was seen as ceremonially unclean and separated from God (see [Matthew 7:6](https://ref.ly/Matt7:6)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 15:26

## Matthew 15:29–31 (id: 21792)

* Jesus returned to an area with mostly gentiles (non\-Jews) and performed many miracles. Although God mainly sent Jesus for Israel ([Matthew 15:21–28](https://ref.ly/Matt15:21-Matt15:28)), Jesus also started a new era for gentile salvation ([1:3](https://ref.ly/Matt1:3), [5–6](https://ref.ly/Matt1:5-Matt1:6); [2:1–12](https://ref.ly/Matt2:1-Matt2:12); [4:12–16](https://ref.ly/Matt4:12-Matt4:16); [8:5–13](https://ref.ly/Matt8:5-Matt8:13); [15:21–28](https://ref.ly/Matt15:21-Matt15:28); [28:16–20](https://ref.ly/Matt28:16-Matt28:20)).
* These healings show that God's kingdom began with the work of Jesus ([8:1–9:34](https://ref.ly/Matt8:1-Matt9:34); [11:5–6](https://ref.ly/Matt11:5-Matt11:6); [12:28](https://ref.ly/Matt12:28)).
* *the God of Israel*: This suggests that the crowd ([15:30](https://ref.ly/Matt15:30)) was mostly gentile.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 15:29–MAT 15:31

## Matthew 15:32–39 (id: 21794)

The earlier feeding miracle (see [Matthew 14:13–21](https://ref.ly/Matt14:13-Matt14:21)) was for the Jews. This miracle extended the blessing to the gentiles. It continues the theme found in [Matthew 15:27](https://ref.ly/Matt15:27). By this miracle, Jesus showed that he is the true "bread of life" (see [16:5–12](https://ref.ly/Matt16:5-Matt16:12); [John 6](https://ref.ly/John6:1-John6:71)).

*Magadan* is a place whose location is unknown. It may be the same as Magdala, as some Greek manuscripts say (see also [Mark 8:10](https://ref.ly/Mark8:10)).

## Matthew 16:1–12 (id: 21799)

After being welcomed among the gentiles (non\-Jews), Jesus returned to his own people. There he faced rejection again.

## Matthew 16:2–3 (id: 21807)

The leaders asked Jesus for a sign from heaven ([Matthew 16:1](https://ref.ly/Matt16:1)). Jesus made a wordplay with their request. They could read signs in the sky to predict the weather (the Greek word *ouranos* means both “sky” and “heaven”). But they failed to recognize the Messiah, even though many signs had already been given (see [11:1–6](https://ref.ly/Matt11:1-Matt11:6)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 16:2–MAT 16:3

## Matthew 16:3 (id: 21817)

*The signs of the times* were Jesus himself and the miracles he performed (see [Matthew 16:4](https://ref.ly/Matt16:4); [11:2–6](https://ref.ly/Matt11:2-Matt11:6); [12:28](https://ref.ly/Matt12:28)).

## Matthew 16:9–10 (id: 21818)

Jesus had shown his disciples that he is the true "bread of life" ([15:32–39](https://ref.ly/Matt15:32-Matt15:39); [John 6:35](https://ref.ly/John6:35), [48](https://ref.ly/John6:48)). In contrast, the Jewish leaders taught things that were wrong. Their false teaching spread everywhere, like yeast (or leaven) spreads through bread dough (see study note on Matt 16:11–12).

## Matthew 16:11–12 (id: 21800)

*Leaven* (or yeast) often symbolizes sin and evil (see [Exodus 12:8](https://ref.ly/Exod12:8), [15](https://ref.ly/Exod12:15); [Leviticus 6:16–17](https://ref.ly/Lev6:16-Lev6:17); [Galatians 5:9](https://ref.ly/Gal5:9)). Here, it represents how deceptive teaching spreads.

## Matthew 16:13 (id: 21801)

*Caesarea Philippi* was about forty kilometers (twenty\-five miles) north of Capernaum. It had many shrines (holy places) dedicated to Pan, the Roman god of nature.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 16:13

## Matthew 16:14 (id: 21802)

* Some, like Herod Antipas, thought Jesus was John the Baptist raised from the dead ([Matthew 14:1–2](https://ref.ly/Matt14:1-Matt14:2)).
* Others expected Elijah to return before the Messiah came ([11:14](https://ref.ly/Matt11:14); [17:10–12](https://ref.ly/Matt17:10-Matt17:12); [Malachi 3:1](https://ref.ly/Mal3:1); [4:5–6](https://ref.ly/Mal4:5-Mal4:6)).
* *Jeremiah or one of the prophets*: Some thought Jesus was Jeremiah or another prophet. Certain Jews believed Jeremiah would rise again (see *2 Maccabees* 15:13–16\). Because Jesus spoke strongly on sensitive issues ([Matthew 5:17](https://ref.ly/Matt5:17); [15:1–20](https://ref.ly/Matt15:1-Matt15:20)), some thought he was Jeremiah.

    At this point, people did not yet understand that Jesus was the Messiah (God’s chosen one).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 16:14

## Matthew 16:16 (id: 21803)

Peter acknowledges Jesus as "the Christ, the Son of the living God" ([Matthew 3:17](https://ref.ly/Matt3:17)). This showed that God had opened Peter’s eyes through faith (see [11:25–27](https://ref.ly/Matt11:25-Matt11:27); [14:33](https://ref.ly/Matt14:33); [27:54](https://ref.ly/Matt27:54)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 16:16

## Matthew 16:17 (id: 21804)

God revealed to Peter his plan for saving people through Jesus, the Messiah. This moment of revelation was key in showing God's will for humanity (see [Galatians 1:16](https://ref.ly/Gal1:16); [3:23](https://ref.ly/Gal3:23); [Ephesians 3:5](https://ref.ly/Eph3:5)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 16:17

## Matthew 16:18 (id: 21805)

* In Greek, Peter’s name is *Petros*, which means “rock” or “stone.” When Jesus says, *on this rock* (Greek *petra*), he is making a play on words between Peter’s name (*Petros*) and the word for rock (*petra*).

    Peter was the foundational "rock" because he was the first to confess Jesus as the Christ and was leader of the apostles. He was the "founding member" of the Church (see [Ephesians 2:20–22](https://ref.ly/Eph2:20-Eph2:22); [Revelation 21:14](https://ref.ly/Rev21:14)).

    Some scholars think Jesus was talking about himself when he mentioned this rock. But it seems Jesus was referring to Peter or Peter's confession. However, it is clearly the church of Jesus, not of Peter. Jesus himself will build it. So, later church leaders do not need to get their authority from Peter.

* Matthew is the only gospel writer who uses the term "church" (also [Matthew 18:17](https://ref.ly/Matt18:17)). Here, it means "the community of God’s people" rather than the expanded idea of an organized church.
* *will not prevail against it*: The church will not be defeated by Satan's attacks (see [Matthew 11:12](https://ref.ly/Matt11:12); [13:24–30](https://ref.ly/Matt13:24-Matt13:30), [36–43](https://ref.ly/Matt13:36-Matt13:43)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 16:18

## Matthew 16:19 (id: 21806)

* *Keys* symbolize access to special knowledge that gives someone authority (see [Matthew 13:16–17](https://ref.ly/Matt13:16-Matt13:17); [23:13](https://ref.ly/Matt23:13); [Isaiah 22:22](https://ref.ly/Isa22:22); [Revelation 3:7](https://ref.ly/Rev3:7)).
* *bind … loose*: Jesus gave Peter (and later the rest of the twelve apostles, [Matthew 18:18](https://ref.ly/Matt18:18)) the authority to teach God's will as Jesus Christ revealed it ([13:52](https://ref.ly/Matt13:52); [18:15–20](https://ref.ly/Matt18:15-Matt18:20); [23:2–12](https://ref.ly/Matt23:2-Matt23:12); [28:16–20](https://ref.ly/Matt28:16-Matt28:20)).
* *will be*: You could also translate this as *will have been.* This emphasizes that God’s sovereign decision comes first.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 16:19

## Matthew 16:21 (id: 21809)

* This is the first of three times Jesus told his disciples that he would suffer. He said he would be betrayed, crucified, and killed (see also [Matthew 17:22–23](https://ref.ly/Matt17:22-Matt17:23); [20:18–19](https://ref.ly/Matt20:18-Matt20:19)). Each of these predictions also taught a lesson about the cost of following him (see [16:24–27](https://ref.ly/Matt16:24-Matt16:27); [20:20–28](https://ref.ly/Matt20:20-Matt20:28)).
* The suffering of Jesus was part of God’s plan and was necessary for the Messiah (see [17:12](https://ref.ly/Matt17:12)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 16:21

## Matthew 16:21–28 (id: 21808)

Jesus was now officially recognized by his disciples as the Messiah. He then began to reveal a surprising part of his mission. He must suffer before entering his glory ([Matthew 16:21–23](https://ref.ly/Matt16:21-Matt16:23)). Those who follow him will also face suffering ([16:24–28](https://ref.ly/Matt16:24-Matt16:28)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 16:21–MAT 16:28

## Matthew 16:22 (id: 21810)

*began to rebuke Him*: Peter realized that Jesus was God's Messiah. But he did not understand that the Messiah had to suffer.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 16:22

## Matthew 16:23 (id: 21811)

* Just as Satan tempted Jesus to take royal privileges without first going to the cross (see [Matthew 4:8–10](https://ref.ly/Matt4:8-Matt4:10)), so now Jesus saw Peter’s words as stirred up by satanic forces.
* *a stumbling block:* This is something that causes a person to fall.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 16:23

## Matthew 16:24 (id: 21812)

* *deny* … *take up* … *follow*: These three commands symbolize an extreme commitment. They mean confessing sins to God with humility, giving personal goals to God, and living by his will (see also [Matthew 5:20](https://ref.ly/Matt5:20); [10:34–39](https://ref.ly/Matt10:34-Matt10:39); [18:1–5](https://ref.ly/Matt18:1-Matt18:5); [20:20–28](https://ref.ly/Matt20:20-Matt20:28)).
* *take up his cross:* This is a metaphor for devotion (see [Luke 9:23](https://ref.ly/Luke9:23)). It is not necessarily a command to die for one's faith, though that is always a possibility for the disciples of Jesus ([Matthew 5:10–12](https://ref.ly/Matt5:10-Matt5:12); [10:21](https://ref.ly/Matt10:21)).
* Matthew uses *follow* both literally (see [Matthew 9:19](https://ref.ly/Matt9:19); [26:58](https://ref.ly/Matt26:58)) and as a metaphor. Metaphorically, it shows interest in a teacher ([4:25](https://ref.ly/Matt4:25); [8:1](https://ref.ly/Matt8:1), [10](https://ref.ly/Matt8:10); [12:15](https://ref.ly/Matt12:15); [14:13](https://ref.ly/Matt14:13); [19:2](https://ref.ly/Matt19:2); [20:29](https://ref.ly/Matt20:29); [21:9](https://ref.ly/Matt21:9)) or personal loyalty to Jesus. This involves him summoning, a response to commit, and significant ongoing struggles ([4:20](https://ref.ly/Matt4:20), [22](https://ref.ly/Matt4:22); [8:19](https://ref.ly/Matt8:19), [22–23](https://ref.ly/Matt8:22-Matt8:23); [9:9](https://ref.ly/Matt9:9); [10:38](https://ref.ly/Matt10:38); [16:24](https://ref.ly/Matt16:24); [19:21](https://ref.ly/Matt19:21), [27](https://ref.ly/Matt19:27)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 16:24

## Matthew 16:25 (id: 21813)

The disciples of Jesus need to give up control of their own lives, even being willing to suffer or die for him. Jesus promised that those who follow him in this way may suffer now, but at the final judgment God will show them to be right, clear away every false charge, and welcome them into his kingdom with honor (see [1 Peter 2:23](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:23)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 16:25

## Matthew 16:26 (id: 21814)

*His soul*: "Soul" and "life" ([Matthew 16:25](https://ref.ly/Matt16:25)) both translate the same Greek word *psuchē.* It refers to the essence or being of a person—the self.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 16:26

## Matthew 16:27 (id: 21815)

The command to deny oneself and follow Jesus has its basis in the fact that Jesus will return to judge all people according to what they have done (see [Matthew 19:28](https://ref.ly/Matt19:28); [24:29–31](https://ref.ly/Matt24:29-Matt24:31); [25:31](https://ref.ly/Matt25:31); [Psalm 62:12](https://ref.ly/Ps62:12); [Proverbs 24:12](https://ref.ly/Prov24:12)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 16:27

## Matthew 16:28 (id: 21816)

* This saying might refer to:

    1. the transfiguration that follows ([Matthwe 17:1–13](https://ref.ly/Matt17:1-Matt17:13));
        2. the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ ([27:50–53](https://ref.ly/Matt27:50-Matt27:53); [28:1–10](https://ref.ly/Matt28:1-Matt28:10));
        3. Pentecost ([Acts 2:1–47](https://ref.ly/Acts2:1-Acts2:47));
        4. the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70 ([Matt 24:1–31](https://ref.ly/Matt24:1-Matt24:31));
        5. the future second coming of Christ ([24:29–31](https://ref.ly/Matt24:29-Matt24:31)); or
        6. an ongoing revelation of God’s kingdom, including worldwide evangelism.
        In the fourth view, *coming* would mean "coming in judgment" on sinful Israel.

* The term Son of Man ([16:27–28](https://ref.ly/Matt16:27-Matt16:28)) creates an *inclusio* (bracketing expression) with [16:13](https://ref.ly/Matt16:13). This creates a unified section ([16:13–28](https://ref.ly/Matt16:13-Matt16:28)) together around the question of who the Son of Man is. He is the Messiah who would first suffer, then be exalted by God, and finally return as Judge.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 16:28

## Matthew 17:1 (id: 21821)

* *Peter, James, and John* later went with Jesus to Gethsemane ([Matthew 26:37](https://ref.ly/Matt26:37); [2 Peter 1:16–19](https://ref.ly/2Pet1:16-2Pet1:19)).
* We cannot know the exact location of this high mountain. The traditional site, Mount Tabor, is about 580 meters high (1,900 feet). It is not on the way if leaving from Caesarea Philippi ([Matthew 16:13](https://ref.ly/Matt16:13)) to go to Capernaum ([17:24](https://ref.ly/Matt17:24)).

    Mount Hermon is another option. It is about 2,800 meters high (9,200 feet) and located in Syria, about sixty\-four kilometers (forty miles) north of Capernaum. Yet, it is improbable that “scribes” ([Mark 9:14](https://ref.ly/Mark9:14)) would have gathered at the base of a mountain in non\-Jewish territory. A likely location is Mount Meron, about 1,220 meters high (4,000 feet). It is located between Caesarea Philippi and Capernaum.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 17:1

## Matthew 17:2 (id: 21826)

*He was transfigured*: In this moment, the inner and divine nature of Jesus, normally hidden, was now revealed. The three disciples were given a glimpse of his glory (see [Exodus 34:29–35](https://ref.ly/Exod34:29-Exod34:35); [Psalm 104:2](https://ref.ly/Ps104:2); [2 Corinthians 3:12–18](https://ref.ly/2Cor3:12-2Cor3:18); [Revelation 1:16](https://ref.ly/Rev1:16)). All of the disciples of Jesus will share in this glory one day ([Matthew 13:43](https://ref.ly/Matt13:43)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 17:2

## Matthew 17:3 (id: 21827)

Moses represents the law, and Elijah represents the prophets. They appeared as witnesses to Christ. Their presence showed that Jesus, the Son of God, fulfills everything written in the law and the prophets (see [Matthew 5:17–20](https://ref.ly/Matt5:17-Matt5:20); [11:2–6](https://ref.ly/Matt11:2-Matt11:6); [12:28](https://ref.ly/Matt12:28)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 17:3

## Matthew 17:4 (id: 21828)

*Three shelters* (Or *three tabernacles*): Peter probably thought the kingdom of heaven was about to arrive in full glory (compare [Acts 1:6](https://ref.ly/Acts1:6)). He wanted to remember the moment by building shelters.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 17:4

## Matthew 17:5 (id: 21829)

* *A bright cloud enveloped them:* In the Old Testament, a cloud often showed God’s presence with Israel during the time of Moses (see [Exodus 24:15–18](https://ref.ly/Exod24:15-Exod24:18); [25:8](https://ref.ly/Exod25:8); [29:45–46](https://ref.ly/Exod29:45-Exod29:46); [40:34–38](https://ref.ly/Exod40:34-Exod40:38)).
* *My beloved Son*: This confirmed what Peter had already declared about Jesus ([Matthew 16:16–17](https://ref.ly/Matt16:16-Matt16:17)).
* The disciples were told to listen to Jesus because he is God’s Son. As a prophet, he reveals God’s will ([11:27](https://ref.ly/Matt11:27); see [Deuteronomy 18:15](https://ref.ly/Deut18:15), [18](https://ref.ly/Deut18:18); [Acts 3:22–23](https://ref.ly/Acts3:22-Acts3:23); [7:37](https://ref.ly/Acts7:37)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 17:5

## Matthew 17:6–7 (id: 21830)

People often react this way when they experience God's glory (for example, [Isaiah 6:5](https://ref.ly/Isa6:5); [Daniel 8:17](https://ref.ly/Dan8:17); [10:9](https://ref.ly/Dan10:9), [15–19](https://ref.ly/Dan10:15-Dan10:19); [Revelation 1:17](https://ref.ly/Rev1:17)).

People could not fully understand Jesus until he completed his work, especially his death and resurrection.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 17:9

## Matthew 17:10–13 (id: 21819)

Elijah’s appearance made the disciples ask about the belief that Elijah must return before the Messiah comes (see [Malachi 4:5–6](https://ref.ly/Mal4:5-Mal4:6)). Jesus pointed to John the Baptist as the one who fulfilled that role. In doing so, he reminded them of the surprising truth that the Messiah must suffer, just as John, his forerunner, had also suffered ([Matthew 14:3–12](https://ref.ly/Matt14:3-Matt14:12)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 17:10–MAT 17:13

## Matthew 17:17 (id: 21820)

*O unbelieving and perverse generation*: This phrase often describes moral corruption (see [Deuteronomy 32:5](https://ref.ly/Deut32:5), [19–22](https://ref.ly/Deut32:19-Deut32:22)). Jesus usually directed this exclamation at unbelieving Jewish crowds or leaders who refused to recognize God's presence in him (see [Matthew 12:39](https://ref.ly/Matt12:39)). But here the phrase sharply criticizes his disciples for not trusting in Jesus and his power to save and heal.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 17:17

## Matthew 17:20 (id: 21822)

* Here, the phrase *so little faith* means the same as *no faith*.
* *faith the size of a mustard seed*: This suggests that even a tiny amount of faith can help the disciples achieve great things ([Hebrews 21:21](https://ref.ly/Matt21:21); compare [1 Corinthians 13:2](https://ref.ly/1Cor13:2)). It also suggests that if they let their faith increase (see [Matthew 13:31–32](https://ref.ly/Matt13:31-Matt13:32)), they could act with strong belief.
* "Moving mountains" is a saying that means overcoming obstacles and achieving God's goals ([Isaiah 40:4](https://ref.ly/Isa40:4); [49:11](https://ref.ly/Isa49:11); [54:10](https://ref.ly/Isa54:10); [1 Corinthians 13:2](https://ref.ly/1Cor13:2)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 17:22

## Matthew 17:24 (id: 21824)

* Every adult citizen of Israel had to pay the temple tax of one\-half shekel. This was a coin weighing 4 grams. In the time of Jesus, priests and some rabbis did not pay this tax.
* Peter spoke on behalf of the twelve apostles (see [Matthew 10:2](https://ref.ly/Matt10:2)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 17:24

## Matthew 17:25–26 (id: 21825)

As an obedient Jew, Jesus would have paid the tax every year, and he did pay it. The lesson Jesus wanted to teach was that as God's Son, he is greater than the temple ([Matthew 12:5–6](https://ref.ly/Matt12:5-Matt12:6)). By this, he showed that a decisive break with the temple was coming (see [16:18–19](https://ref.ly/Matt16:18-Matt16:19); [21:33–46](https://ref.ly/Matt21:33-Matt21:46)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 17:25–MAT 17:26

## Matthew 18:1 (id: 21844)

*At that time:* Matthew connects the disciples' questions to the earlier teaching about the temple. The disciples started to think their new freedom from Jewish authority gave them their own authority. 

Jesus had also spoken about special revelations ([Matthew 11:25–27](https://ref.ly/Matt11:25-Matt11:27); [13:11–17](https://ref.ly/Matt13:11-Matt13:17)) and about leadership roles ([10:2–4](https://ref.ly/Matt10:2-Matt10:4); [19:28](https://ref.ly/Matt19:28)). This may have caused jealousy and arguments about power among the disciples. Their disputes may have centered on the importance of Peter ([17:25](https://ref.ly/Matt17:25)) or the special place of Peter, James, and John ([17:1–3](https://ref.ly/Matt17:1-Matt17:3)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 18:1

## Matthew 18:1–35 (id: 21832)

This fourth major teaching in Matthew (see study note on Matthew 5:1–7:29) focuses on how people responded to the Messiah. The disciples accepted him, while the Jewish leaders and most people did not. As this division increased, Jesus taught his disciples about community life. 

To follow the standards of Jesus, a community should live with:

* humility ([18:1–5](https://ref.ly/Matt18:1-Matt18:5)),
* sensitivity ([18:6–9](https://ref.ly/Matt18:6-Matt18:9)),
* compassion ([18:10–14](https://ref.ly/Matt18:10-Matt18:14)),
* discipline ([18:15–18](https://ref.ly/Matt18:15-Matt18:18)), and
* forgiveness ([18:21–35](https://ref.ly/Matt18:21-Matt18:35)).

Like the other teachings, a closing statement ([19:1–2](https://ref.ly/Matt19:1-Matt19:2)) connects to the next section.

*Like little children* means being humble ([Matthew 18:4](https://ref.ly/Matt18:4)). The disciples had been focused on status and ambition.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 18:3

## Matthew 18:5 (id: 21854)

Jesus then talked about unity in the community. Welcoming a humble disciple of Jesus is the same as welcoming Jesus himself (see [Matthew 10:40–42](https://ref.ly/Matt10:40-Matt10:42)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 18:5

## Matthew 18:6 (id: 21855)

* *Cause one … to stumble*: This means to lead believers to turn away from Christ, whether children or adults who have become “like children” in faith (see [Matthew 18:3](https://ref.ly/Matt18:3)).
* The title *little ones* emphasizes their humility (see [5:3–12](https://ref.ly/Matt5:3-Matt5:12); [18:4](https://ref.ly/Matt18:4); [19:13–15](https://ref.ly/Matt19:13-Matt19:15)).
* The thought of being drowned with a large millstone around the neck is terrifying. But Jesus warned that causing someone to lose faith will bring even greater suffering ([18:7](https://ref.ly/Matt18:7); [26:24](https://ref.ly/Matt26:24); [Revelation 18:21](https://ref.ly/Rev18:21); [Matthew 22:13](https://ref.ly/Matt22:13)).

## Matthew 18:8–9 (id: 21856)

Jesus shifts his concern to the person. You must remove anything that leads you to sin (see [Matthew 5:29–30](https://ref.ly/Matt5:29-Matt5:30); [Colossians 3:5–17](https://ref.ly/Col3:5-Col3:17)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 18:8–MAT 18:9

## Matthew 18:10 (id: 21833)

* *Do not look down on any of these:* This can happen by refusing to welcome them ([Matthew 18:5–6](https://ref.ly/Matt18:5-Matt18:6)) or by not providing pastoral care when needed ([18:12–14](https://ref.ly/Matt18:12-Matt18:14); see [19:13–15](https://ref.ly/Matt19:13-Matt19:15)).
* *their angels*: See [Matthew 4:5–7](https://ref.ly/Matt4:5-Matt4:7); [Hebrews 1:14](https://ref.ly/Heb1:14).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 18:10

## Matthew 18:12 (id: 21834)

Just as a shepherd works to find a lost sheep*,* we must not despise or ignore the “little ones” ([Matthew 18:6](https://ref.ly/Matt18:6)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 18:12

## Matthew 18:14 (id: 21835)

The shepherd's joy is the same as the Father's joy. The goal of pastoral care is to ensure God keeps all his sheep.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 18:14

## Matthew 18:15 (id: 21838)

If another believer sins, love means we should talk to them privately and point out the wrong ([Leviticus 19:17](https://ref.ly/Lev19:17); [Luke 17:3](https://ref.ly/Luke17:3); [Galatians 6:1](https://ref.ly/Gal6:1); [1 Timothy 5:20](https://ref.ly/1Tim5:20); [Titus 3:10](https://ref.ly/Titus3:10)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 18:15

## Matthew 18:15–20 (id: 21836)

Resolving issues should be private at first and only made public if absolutely necessary.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 18:15–MAT 18:20

## Matthew 18:15–35 (id: 21837)

The community of believers should stay united and avoid conflicts. Members should seek reconciliation ([Matthew 18:15–20](https://ref.ly/Matt18:15-Matt18:20)) and be ready to forgive ([18:21–35](https://ref.ly/Matt18:21-Matt18:35)). Sometimes, strict discipline might be necessary ([18:17](https://ref.ly/Matt18:17)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 18:15–MAT 18:35

## Matthew 18:16 (id: 21839)

By requiring one or two others to be present*,* Jesus stopped slander and false accusations among the congregation (see [John 8:17](https://ref.ly/John8:17); [2 Corinthians 13:1](https://ref.ly/2Cor13:1); [1 Timothy 5:19](https://ref.ly/1Tim5:19); [Hebrews 10:28](https://ref.ly/Heb10:28)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 18:16

## Matthew 18:17 (id: 21840)

* The church is the local Christian community.
* An unrepentant person (someone refusing to turn from sin) is to be treated as an outsider, like a lawbreaker. Excluding a person from fellowship (sometimes called excommunication) comes from the belief that God’s people must be holy ([Acts 5:1–6](https://ref.ly/Acts5:1-Acts5:6); [Romans 16:17](https://ref.ly/Rom16:17); [1 Corinthians 5:1–13](https://ref.ly/1Cor5:1-1Cor5:13); [2 Corinthians 6:14–18](https://ref.ly/2Cor6:14-2Cor6:18); [Galatians 5:7–12](https://ref.ly/Gal5:7-Gal5:12); [2 Thessalonians 3:14–15](https://ref.ly/2Thess3:14-2Thess3:15)). Sin harms fellowship with both other believers and with God. The goal is not revenge or control, but to restore the sinner to holiness and community ([Matthew 18:10–15](https://ref.ly/Matt18:10-Matt18:15); [Galatians 6:1](https://ref.ly/Gal6:1); [James 5:19–20](https://ref.ly/Jas5:19-Jas5:20)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 18:17

## Matthew 18:18 (id: 21842)

*Bind … loose*: The privilege and authority Jesus gave to Peter ([Matthew 16:19](https://ref.ly/Matt16:19)) are here given to the church (or possibly to the twelve apostles, [18:1](https://ref.ly/Matt18:1)). The community's decisions, when they are in agreement with God's will, are eternally binding.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 18:18

## Matthew 18:18–20 (id: 21841)

These sayings guide how to discipline and restore members in the community of disciples.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 18:18–MAT 18:20

## Matthew 18:19 (id: 21843)

*Anything you ask for*: In the context of church discipline ([18:15–17](https://ref.ly/Matt18:15-Matt18:17)), this means discipline must be done in a prayerful way.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 18:19

## Matthew 18:20 (id: 21845)

Christ is present in the process of church discipline, so this process confirms God's decision.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 18:20

## Matthew 18:21–35 (id: 21846)

Peter thought forgiving seven times was generous, but Jesus surprised him. A disciple should graciously forgive like God does, without limits and freely (see [Matthew 18:10–14](https://ref.ly/Matt18:10-Matt18:14)). If someone does not forgive in this way, it shows they have not experienced God's forgiveness for themselves ([18:35](https://ref.ly/Matt18:35); see [6:12](https://ref.ly/Matt6:12)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 18:21–MAT 18:35

## Matthew 18:22 (id: 21847)

*Seventy\-seven times*: sus teaches that forgiveness should have no limit. His followers must forgive sincerely, not only in words but also in attitude and actions ([Matthew 18:35](https://ref.ly/Matt18:35); see also [Genesis 4:23–24](https://ref.ly/Gen4:23-Gen4:24)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 18:22

## Matthew 18:24 (id: 21848)

*Ten thousand talents*: The talent was the largest unit of currency, but its value changed over time. This debt was impossible to repay. This amount was more than all of Galilee's tax revenue.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 18:24

## Matthew 18:26 (id: 21849)

*I will pay back everything:* the slave's promise to pay the huge debt emphasizes the king's great mercy and the slave's lack of forgiveness ([Matthew 18:29–30](https://ref.ly/Matt18:29-Matt18:30)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 18:26

## Matthew 18:28 (id: 21850)

*A hundred denarii*: The first servant owed a debt about one million times larger than this amount owed to him.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 18:28

## Matthew 18:34 (id: 21851)

* This is how God reacts to those who refuse to forgive ([Matthew 18:35](https://ref.ly/Matt18:35)).
* *until he should repay all that he owed*: This means permanently, because he could never repay the debt.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 18:34

## Matthew 18:35 (id: 21852)

*That is how My heavenly Father will treat each of you*: Prison and torture ([Matthew 18:34](https://ref.ly/Matt18:34)) is a metaphor for hell (see [5:22](https://ref.ly/Matt5:22)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 18:35

## Matthew 19:1–20.34 (id: 21857)

Jesus was traveling to Jerusalem ([Matthew 19:1](https://ref.ly/Matt19:1); [20:29](https://ref.ly/Matt20:29); [21:1](https://ref.ly/Matt21:1)). This was another chance to teach the disciples what it means to be his disciples.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 19:1–MAT 20:19

## Matthew 19:3 (id: 21867)

There were two different opinions on when a man could divorce his wife: 

1. One group of Pharisees, following Rabbi Shammai, believed divorce was only allowable for adultery or serious wrongdoing.
2. The other group, following Rabbi Hillel, thought a man could divorce his wife for any reason, even if she burned his dinner.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 19:3

## Matthew 19:4–5 (id: 21868)

The Pharisees did not consider *all* of God's teachings. God intended marriage to be a permanent union (see [Genesis 2:18–25](https://ref.ly/Gen2:18-Gen2:25); see also [1 Corinthians 7:10–16](https://ref.ly/1Cor7:10-1Cor7:16)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 19:4–MAT 19:5

## Matthew 19:6 (id: 21869)

Since God created marriage as a union, people do not have the right to end it. Jesus confirmed that divorce should not happen.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 19:6

## Matthew 19:7–8 (id: 21870)

*Why … did Moses order*: The Pharisees believed Jesus contradicted a command in the law (see [Deuteronomy 24:1–4](https://ref.ly/Deut24:1-Deut24:4)). But Moses allowed divorce only because of people's stubbornness. Jesus introduced the radical idea that what God permits is not always what he desires (see [1 Corinthians 6:12](https://ref.ly/1Cor6:12)). Divorce is never what God desires ([Malachi 2:14–16](https://ref.ly/Mal2:14-Mal2:16)). It shows the brokenness of human sin.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 19:7–MAT 19:8

## Matthew 19:9 (id: 21871)

* Jesus allows only one valid reason for a man to divorce: if his wife has been unfaithful (see [Matthew 5:32](https://ref.ly/Matt5:32)). For those who thought divorce was easy, Jesus emphasizes God's created order. Marriage is meant to last forever (see [Mark 10:11–12](https://ref.ly/Mark10:11-Mark10:12)).
* *commits adultery*: This refers to a man who divorces his wife without a valid reason. If he remarries, it is the same as adultery. Jesus aims to reestablish that marriage is permanent.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 19:9

## Matthew 19:11 (id: 21858)

This statement refers to what the disciples said in [Matthew 19:10](https://ref.ly/Matt19:10).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 19:11

## Matthew 19:12 (id: 21859)

* *Eunuchs* are men who cannot physically have children, either because of a birth defect or because they were made unable through surgery (castration). Jesus also used the word in a figurative way for those who choose not to marry (see [Luke 14:26](https://ref.ly/Luke14:26); [18:29](https://ref.ly/Luke18:29); [1 Corinthians 7:7–8](https://ref.ly/1Cor7:7-1Cor7:8)).
* *for the sake of the kingdom of Heaven*: Jesus was not criticizing marriage. He meant that unmarried people often have more freedom for ministry (see [1 Corinthians 7:25–35](https://ref.ly/1Cor7:25-1Cor7:35)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 19:12

## Matthew 19:13 (id: 21860)

* Jesus would place his hands on others to bless them (see [Luke 4:40](https://ref.ly/Luke4:40); [13:13](https://ref.ly/Luke13:13); see also [Genesis 48:14–15](https://ref.ly/Gen48:14-Gen48:15); [Acts 19:6](https://ref.ly/Acts19:6)).
* The disciples tried to stop the parents from bringing children to Jesus. They wanted to protect him, but their action showed the wrong attitude toward children (see [Matthew 18:5–6](https://ref.ly/Matt18:5-Matt18:6), [10](https://ref.ly/Matt18:10)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 19:13

## Matthew 19:17 (id: 21861)

* *Why do you ask Me:* as a Jew, the man should have known that God shows his standard of goodness in his commandments. The man's questions show he did not trust God's revealed will (also [Matthew 19:20](https://ref.ly/Matt19:20)).
* *there is only One who is good*: The man might have thought he could be perfectly good on his own, but only God is the truly good. So, God is from where all goodness comes.
* *keep the commandments*: Jesus might be trying to show the man his own sinfulness by asking him to do the impossible. Or more probably, he is restating that good works are the clear measure of how true a person's faith is (see [7:13–27](https://ref.ly/Matt7:13-Matt7:27)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 19:17

## Matthew 19:21–22 (id: 21862)

When Jesus told the man to *go, sell … come, follow*, Jesus revealed that the man had not truly followed the first of the Ten Commandments ([Exodus 20:3](https://ref.ly/Exod20:3)). His possessions (his wealth and security) had become his god (see [Matthew 6:20](https://ref.ly/Matt6:20), [24](https://ref.ly/Matt6:24); [13:44–46](https://ref.ly/Matt13:44-Matt13:46)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 19:21–MAT 19:22

## Matthew 19:23 (id: 21863)

* Jesus teaches a lesson about discipleship from the rich man's sad refusal. It is difficult for the rich to humble themselves, admit their needs, and trust in God (see [Matthew 5:3](https://ref.ly/Matt5:3); [Luke 6:24](https://ref.ly/Luke6:24); [1 Timothy 6:9–10](https://ref.ly/1Tim6:9-1Tim6:10)).
* *The kingdom of heaven* here means *eternal life* ([Matthew 19:16–17](https://ref.ly/Matt19:16-Matt19:17), [29](https://ref.ly/Matt19:29)) or *salvation* as a result of God's renewing work ([19:25–26](https://ref.ly/Matt19:25-Matt19:26)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 19:23

## Matthew 19:24 (id: 21864)

* *Easier for a camel*: This analogy emphasizes how difficult it is *for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God*. Some manuscripts use a Greek word meaning *rope* (*kamilos*) instead of *camel* (*kamēlos*), a difference of only one letter.
* *to pass through the eye of a needle*: This image suggests it is impossible for wealthy people to enter the kingdom of God. But the situation is not completely hopeless ([Matthew 19:26–27](https://ref.ly/Matt19:26-Matt19:27)). See study note on Mark 10:25.

* **Associated Articles:** Mark 10:25 (ID: `21237@TyndaleStudyNotes`)

## Matthew 19:26 (id: 21865)

God's renewing grace is completely essential for the wealthy to be able to repent from making wealth an idol, give up their possessions if needed, and follow Jesus ([Matthew 19:21](https://ref.ly/Matt19:21)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 19:26

## Matthew 19:28 (id: 21866)

* *You …* *will also sit on twelve thrones*: The disciples will share in judging. This is a reversal, where those who are rich and powerful now will be judged by those who are humble and poor (see [Matthew 19:30](https://ref.ly/Matt19:30)).
* *Judging* can mean both ruling with authority and condemning for wrongdoing (see [Revelation 20:4](https://ref.ly/Rev20:4)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 19:28

## Matthew 20:1–16 (id: 21888)

This parable is like the parable of the lost son ([Luke 15:11–32](https://ref.ly/Luke15:11-Luke15:32)). In both, God shows grace to two groups, but one complains about unfair treatment.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 20:1–MAT 20:16

## Matthew 20:8 (id: 21900)

Workers received their pay at the end of the day ([Deuteronomy 24:14–15](https://ref.ly/Deut24:14-Deut24:15)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 20:16

## Matthew 20:20–21 (id: 21890)

This mother's question seems to have come from her sons, as Jesus answered the sons instead of the mother (compare [Mark 10:35–37](https://ref.ly/Mark10:35-Mark10:37)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 20:20–MAT 20:21

## Matthew 20:20–28 (id: 21891)

Each time Jesus predicted his suffering in the Gospel of Matthew, he also gave teaching about what it means to be his disciple. These teachings showed that discipleship is shaped by Jesus own path of service and sacrifice (see [Matthew 16:24–28](https://ref.ly/Matt16:24-Matt16:28); [17:24–18:5](https://ref.ly/Matt17:24-Matt18:5)). This teaching called the Messiah's disciples to imitate his service and sacrifice.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 20:20–MAT 20:28

## Matthew 20:21 (id: 21892)

Jesus had already promised positions of authority in God’s kingdom to the disciples ([Matthew 19:28](https://ref.ly/Matt19:28)). The request of the two brothers came from selfish desire to be important, without concern for the suffering the Messiah would soon face (see [Matthew 23:6](https://ref.ly/Matt23:6); [Luke 14:7–11](https://ref.ly/Luke14:7-Luke14:11)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 20:21

## Matthew 20:22 (id: 21893)

The *cup* refers to the duty duty, calling, and destiny of Jesus (see [Matthew 26:39](https://ref.ly/Matt26:39); [John 18:11](https://ref.ly/John18:11); also [Psalm 75:8](https://ref.ly/Ps75:8); [Isaiah 51:17](https://ref.ly/Isa51:17), [22](https://ref.ly/Isa51:22); [Revelation 16:19](https://ref.ly/Rev16:19)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 20:22

## Matthew 20:23 (id: 21894)

*You will indeed*: James eventually died for his faith ([Acts 12:2](https://ref.ly/Acts12:2)). John suffered severe persecution ([Acts 4:3](https://ref.ly/Acts4:3); [5:40](https://ref.ly/Acts5:40); [Revelation 1:9](https://ref.ly/Rev1:9)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 20:23

## Matthew 20:24 (id: 21895)

*The ten …* *they were indignant:* This shows that selfish ambition was not only in James and John. The other disciples also struggled with it (see also [Matthew 21:15](https://ref.ly/Matt21:15); [26:8](https://ref.ly/Matt26:8); [Luke 13:14](https://ref.ly/Luke13:14)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 20:24

## Matthew 20:25–28 (id: 21896)

Rulers who do not know God often desire power and control. But those who follow the Son of Man should not act this way ([Matthew 18:1–5](https://ref.ly/Matt18:1-Matt18:5); [19:13–15](https://ref.ly/Matt19:13-Matt19:15); [23:1–12](https://ref.ly/Matt23:1-Matt23:12)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 20:25–MAT 20:28

## Matthew 20:27 (id: 21897)

Often the word *slave* is a metaphor that describes a disciple's submissive relationship to their master ([Matthew 8:9](https://ref.ly/Matt8:9); [10:24–25](https://ref.ly/Matt10:24-Matt10:25); [24:45–51](https://ref.ly/Matt24:45-Matt24:51); [25:14–30](https://ref.ly/Matt25:14-Matt25:30)). The disciples of Jesus serve others, following his example (for example, [John 13:1–17](https://ref.ly/John13:1-John13:17)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 20:27

## Matthew 20:28 (id: 21898)

* The phrase *the Son of Man … come*: This expression suggests that Jesus already existed before his birth on earth. It points back to Daniel’s vision of the Son of Man coming from heaven to receive authority and glory (see [Daniel 7:13–14](https://ref.ly/Dan7:13-Dan7:14)).
* *as a ransom for many*:Jesus said he would freely give his life as a payment to rescue many people. His death brought freedom from the power and penalty of sin (see [Matthew 26:26–29](https://ref.ly/Matt26:26-Matt26:29); [Isaiah 53:10–12](https://ref.ly/Isa53:10-Isa53:12); [Romans 3:24](https://ref.ly/Rom3:24)). In this way, he bought them out of slavery to sin (see [Galatians 5:1](https://ref.ly/Gal5:1)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 20:28

## Matthew 20:29–34 (id: 21899)

The blind men’s expression of faith in the Son of David was an acknowledgment of Jesus as the Messiah (see [Matthew 21:9](https://ref.ly/Matt21:9); [22:42](https://ref.ly/Matt22:42); [2 Samuel 7:12–16](https://ref.ly/2Sam7:12-2Sam7:16)).

Jesus was revealing himself as the Lord who, as king of Israel, goes up to Mount Zion on a donkey ([Matthew 21:5](https://ref.ly/Matt21:5); see [Zechariah 9:9](https://ref.ly/Zech9:9)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 21:3

## Matthew 21:12 (id: 21904)

* *Buying and selling* happened in the temple complex, in the Court of the Gentiles.
* *Money changers* made profit by exchanging foreign money into the official Jewish currency. Jesus criticized this commercial activity because it dishonored the holiness of the temple (see [Mark 11:11–18](https://ref.ly/Mark11:11-Mark11:18)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 21:12

## Matthew 21:12–13 (id: 21903)

The close association of the temple cleansing (see [John 2:13–16](https://ref.ly/John2:13-John2:16)) and the cursing of the fig tree ([Matthew 21:18–19](https://ref.ly/Matt21:18-Matt21:19)) shows Jesus as the Messiah (God’s chosen one). He confronted Israel and warned that God judges those who reject the Messiah and his message.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 21:12–MAT 21:13

The Jewish leaders’ refusal to believe is contrasted with the joyful faith and praise of little children (see [Matthew 18:1–14](https://ref.ly/Matt18:1-Matt18:14); [19:13–15](https://ref.ly/Matt19:13-Matt19:15)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 21:15

## Matthew 21:16 (id: 21907)

*Have you never read:* Jesus asked this challenging question to opponents who failed to see that his ministry fulfilled the promises about the Messiah (see also [Matthew 12:3](https://ref.ly/Matt12:3), [5](https://ref.ly/Matt12:5); [19:4](https://ref.ly/Matt19:4); [21:42](https://ref.ly/Matt21:42); [22:31](https://ref.ly/Matt22:31)).

## Matthew 21:19 (id: 21908)

* *Nothing on it except leaves*: Mark notes that "it was not the season for figs" (see [Mark 11:13](https://ref.ly/Mark11:13)). It was spring, just before Passover. Figs start growing in spring but ripen in fall.
* *immediately the tree withered*: Matthew seems to have shortened the story (compare [Matthew 21:18–22](https://ref.ly/Matt21:18-Matt21:22); [Mark 11:13–14](https://ref.ly/Mark11:13-Mark11:14), [20–23](https://ref.ly/Mark11:20-Mark11:23)). The cursing of the fig tree symbolizes God's judgment on Israel for rejecting the Messiah (see [Matt 3:9](https://ref.ly/Matt3:9); [8:11–12](https://ref.ly/Matt8:11-Matt8:12)). The Israelites are like a fig tree that looks promising but has no fruit. This was especially true of the hypocritical leaders. They did not *bear fruit*, symbolic of receiving the Messiah (see [21:33–46](https://ref.ly/Matt21:33-Matt21:46)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 21:19

## Matthew 21:22 (id: 21910)

Jesus was encouraging the disciples to trust in God and pray with faith. He was not promising that God would approve everything they might desire ([1 John 5:14–15](https://ref.ly/1John5:14-1John5:15)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 21:22

## Matthew 21:23 (id: 21912)

*Elders of the people:* This refers to the family leaders from each tribe. They were part of the Sanhedrin, the Jewish council in Jerusalem (compare [Ezra 5:5](https://ref.ly/Ezra5:5); [6:14](https://ref.ly/Ezra6:14); [10:8](https://ref.ly/Ezra10:8)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 21:23

## Matthew 21:23–22.46 (id: 21911)

This section focuses on how Jewish leaders challenged the authority of Jesus. Each time, the wisdom of Jesus revealed their lack of spiritual understanding. These debates also revealed the status of Jesus as the Messiah and the consequences of rejecting him. Sadly, the leaders became more resistant with each encounter and plotted to kill Jesus ([Matthew 21:23](https://ref.ly/Matt21:23), [46](https://ref.ly/Matt21:46); [22:15–17](https://ref.ly/Matt22:15-Matt22:17), [23](https://ref.ly/Matt22:23), [34](https://ref.ly/Matt22:34), [41](https://ref.ly/Matt22:41)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 21:23–MAT 22:46

## Matthew 21:24 (id: 21913)

Jesus gave a riddle. The answer solved the leaders’ question and placed them in a dilemma that showed what was in their hearts ([Matthew 21:25–26](https://ref.ly/Matt21:25-Matt21:26)). Asking a counter\-question was common in debates at that time.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 21:24

## Matthew 21:25 (id: 21914)

The minsitry of John, like the ministry of Jesus, was controversial (see [Matthew 3:1](https://ref.ly/Matt3:1), [5–6](https://ref.ly/Matt3:5-Matt3:6)). This was true especially after John publicly criticized Herod Antipas for his sins (see [14:4](https://ref.ly/Matt14:4)). The Jewish leaders did not want to admit that John's work was from God. They had refused to believe John and repent of their sins ([3:2](https://ref.ly/Matt3:2)). They also refused to accept Jesus as the Messiah ([John 1:29–34](https://ref.ly/John1:29-John1:34)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 21:25

## Matthew 21:27 (id: 21915)

The Jewish leaders did not have the honesty or bravery to admit their beliefs about John. So, it was fair for Jesus not to answer their question.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 21:27

## Matthew 21:28–32 (id: 21917)

This parable continues to emphasize why John is important.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 21:28–MAT 21:32

## Matthew 21:28–22.14 (id: 21916)

Three parables expose the guilt of those who rejected the Messiah and lost their special status as God's chosen people. God now considers only those who accept Jesus as the Messiah as his people.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 21:28–MAT 22:14

## Matthew 21:29 (id: 21918)

*I will not*: This response must have offended Jews who learned from a young age to show respect for the authority of a father (see [Matthew 8:21–22](https://ref.ly/Matt8:21-Matt8:22)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 21:29

## Matthew 21:32 (id: 21919)

The right way to live is to follow the will of God ([Matthew 3:15](https://ref.ly/Matt3:15); [5:20](https://ref.ly/Matt5:20); see also [Proverbs 8:20](https://ref.ly/Prov8:20); [12:28](https://ref.ly/Prov12:28)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 21:32

## Matthew 21:33–46 (id: 21920)

In this story, Jesus refers back to [Isaiah 5:1–7](https://ref.ly/Isa5:1-Isa5:7). The people of Israel who rejected God's Messiah lost the privilege of being God's people. Now, God has called the Christian community, made up of both Jews and gentiles (non\-Jews), to be his people (see [Romans 9:4–8](https://ref.ly/Rom9:4-Rom9:8); [11:1–12](https://ref.ly/Rom11:1-Rom11:12)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 21:33–MAT 21:46

## Matthew 21:34–35 (id: 21921)

*He sent his servants*: The prophets had spoken God's message to Israel. In this parable, the tenant farmers represent Israel's leaders, whom Jesus blamed for killing God's prophets ([Matthew 23:29–37](https://ref.ly/Matt23:29-Matt23:37)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 21:34–MAT 21:35

## Matthew 21:37 (id: 21922)

*Finally*: God's revelation reached its goal in Jesus (see [Matthew 13:16–17](https://ref.ly/Matt13:16-Matt13:17); [Hebrews 1:1–2](https://ref.ly/Heb1:1-Heb1:2)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 21:37

## Matthew 21:40 (id: 21925)

*when the owner of the vineyard returns:*The vineyard owner's return symbolizes the Lord's coming for judgment (see [Matthew 16:27](https://ref.ly/Matt16:27); [24:1–36](https://ref.ly/Matt24:1-Matt24:36)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 21:40

## Matthew 21:41 (id: 21926)

The Jewish religious leaders declared their own condemnation.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 21:41

## Matthew 21:42 (id: 21927)

*The cornerstone* was either the first stone of the foundation or the last stone placed, like the top of an arch. The builders rejected this stone as unworthy, but it was actually the most important. Jesus was talking about his role in the kingdom of God ([Matthew 21:43](https://ref.ly/Matt21:43)) and how the Jewish religious leaders rejected him.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 21:42

## Matthew 21:43 (id: 21928)

* *Taken away from you*: Either the privilege of being God’s chosen nation no longer belonged to the Jews, or the religious leaders had lost the privilege of being leaders of God’s people (see [Romans 9–11](https://ref.ly/Rom9:1-Rom11:36)).
* The Christian community is a nation that will produce the proper "fruit" or right results. This means a life of trust and obedience that shows the start of God's kingdom (see [Matthew 3:8](https://ref.ly/Matt3:8); [7:15–20](https://ref.ly/Matt7:15-Matt7:20); [12:33](https://ref.ly/Matt12:33); [13:8](https://ref.ly/Matt13:8), [26](https://ref.ly/Matt13:26)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 21:43

## Matthew 21:44 (id: 21929)

Those who opposed the Messiah would soon win a temporary victory. But the Messiah would eventually defeat them. The *stone* would crush them because the death of Jesus on the cross led to his vindication and triumph (see also [Daniel 2:34–35](https://ref.ly/Dan2:34-Dan2:35), [44–45](https://ref.ly/Dan2:44-Dan2:45)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 21:44

## Matthew 21:45 (id: 21930)

This explanation fits with Matthew’s theme of God’s judgment on the Jewish leaders who misled the people of Israel (see [Matthew 23:13–15](https://ref.ly/Matt23:13-Matt23:15)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 21:45

## Matthew 22:1–14 (id: 21931)

In this parable, Israel had often rejected God’s message in the past. In the same way, Israel rejected the Messiah and faced judgment. In Israel’s place, God raised up the church ([Matthew 16:17–19](https://ref.ly/Matt16:17-Matt16:19); [21:43](https://ref.ly/Matt21:43)). God also expects the church to live in righteousness ([Romans 11:11–24](https://ref.ly/Rom11:11-Rom11:24)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 22:1–MAT 22:14

* The *king* represents God, and *his son* is Jesus ([Galatians 4:4](https://ref.ly/Gal4:4); [Hebrews 1:1–2](https://ref.ly/Heb1:1-Heb1:2)).
* The feast represents the kingdom of the Messiah.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 22:2

## Matthew 22:3–5 (id: 21946)

*those he had invited:* This refers to the nation of Israel. They ignored God's servants, the prophets (see study note on Matthew 21:33–46).

People who refuse God's invitation do not deserve to enter his kingdom (see [Matthew 3:8](https://ref.ly/Matt3:8); [10:13](https://ref.ly/Matt10:13), [37–38](https://ref.ly/Matt10:37-Matt10:38)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 22:8

## Matthew 22:9 (id: 21960)

*as many as you can find*: God's invitation is now open to all people, not only the nation of Israel (see [Matthew 28:16–20](https://ref.ly/Matt28:16-Matt28:20); compare [10:5–6](https://ref.ly/Matt10:5-Matt10:6); [15:21–28](https://ref.ly/Matt15:21-Matt15:28)).

In first\-century Palestine, debates about Roman taxes were intense (see also [Matthew 17:24–27](https://ref.ly/Matt17:24-Matt17:27)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 22:15–MAT 22:22

## Matthew 22:16 (id: 21937)

The Pharisees were strict Jewish leaders who opposed Roman rule. They strongly resisted Roman control and wanted to protect Jewish traditions and independence. They usually disagreed with the supporters of Herod. But in this case, they joined together because both groups hated Jesus.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 22:16

## Matthew 22:17 (id: 21938)

*Is it lawful … or not?*: They asked the question to try and trap Jesus. If he said no, they could arrest him for rebelling against Rome. If he said yes, they could accuse him of supporting Roman oppression.

## Matthew 22:20 (id: 21940)

The people had to pay the poll tax with the denarius coin. This coin showed the picture and title of Caesar (the Roman emperor). Old Testament rules against worshiping images ([Exodus 20:4](https://ref.ly/Exod20:4); [Leviticus 26:1](https://ref.ly/Lev26:1); [Deuteronomy 4:15–24](https://ref.ly/Deut4:15-Deut4:24)) made this coin controversial for Jews (see Josephus, *War* 2\.9\.2–3\). To avoid conflict, some Roman governors in Palestine minted coins without human images. This showed respect for Jewish religious concerns.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 22:20

## Matthew 22:21 (id: 21941)

Jesus answered with wisdom. He said people should give Caesar the honor that belongs to him, but they must give God the greater honor and loyalty. Being loyal to God does not always mean being disloyal to human rulers. Jesus showed that there are two realms of authority, Caesar’s and God’s, and God’s authority is greater ([Acts 4:19](https://ref.ly/Acts4:19)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 22:21

## Matthew 22:23 (id: 21943)

The *Sadducees* (see [Matthew 3:7](https://ref.ly/Matt3:7)) described a situation about *levirate* marriage. This was a Jewish custom where a man marries his brother's widow (see [Genesis 38:6–11](https://ref.ly/Gen38:6-Gen38:11); [Deuteronomy 25:5–6](https://ref.ly/Deut25:5-Deut25:6)). They tried to use this as proof that resurrection from the dead is impossible.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 22:23

## Matthew 22:23–33 (id: 21942)

The *resurrection* was an important topic in the time of Jesus. But the people only asked about it to try and trap him.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 22:23–MAT 22:33

*the power of God:* This probably means God's ability to resurrect people who have died.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 22:29

## Matthew 22:30 (id: 21947)

*like the angels in heaven*: Jesus was not teaching that people will be without gender in heaven. Nor was he criticizing God's order of marriage and sexuality. Instead, he was confirming that God will transform people into a glorious new existence (see [1 Corinthians 15:35–49](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:35-1Cor15:49); [2 Corinthians 5:1–5](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:1-2Cor5:5)). In this new existence, parts of the current world, like marriage, will not be present.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 22:30

## Matthew 22:31–32 (id: 21948)

God spoke of himself as the God of Abraham in the present tense. This shows that Abraham is still alive and that there will be a resurrection.

## Matthew 22:36 (id: 21949)

Many strict Jews believed that every commandment was equally important. Because of this, a careless answer to the question could lead to an accusation of rejecting God’s law.

## Matthew 22:37 (id: 21950)

Jesus answers using the Shema ([Deuteronomy 6:4–9](https://ref.ly/Deut6:4-Deut6:9)), a key statement of God's covenant with Israel. The first Hebrew word in [Deuteronomy 6:4–9](https://ref.ly/Deut6:4-Deut6:9) is *shema*‘, meaning "hear!"

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 22:37

After Jesus defended himself against the traps of his opponents ([21:23–22:40](https://ref.ly/Matt21:23-Matt22:40)), he asked them a question. How can the Messiah be called both the *son of David* and also the *Lord of David* ([Psalm 110:1](https://ref.ly/Ps110:1)).

The Jewish religious leaders tried to find a reason to accuse Jesus publicly but could not ([Matthew 21:23–22:46](https://ref.ly/Matt21:23-Matt22:46)). Jesus then addressed the crowds and his disciples to openly criticize the religious leaders for often failing to obey God's righteous standards.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 23:1

## Matthew 23:2 (id: 21974)

*The scribes and Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat:* This means that they give authoritative explanations about the law of Moses. They passed down oral traditions associated with the law and thought to be from Moses. They judged religious and social issues based on these traditions (see [Matthew 15:2](https://ref.ly/Matt15:2)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 23:2

## Matthew 23:3 (id: 21980)

*practice and obey:* This was not a full confirmation of everything the Pharisees taught (see [Matthew 15:1–20](https://ref.ly/Matt15:1-Matt15:20); [16:5–12](https://ref.ly/Matt16:5-Matt16:12); [23:13–39](https://ref.ly/Matt23:13-Matt23:39)). It might refer only to teachings that agreed with the law of Moses, or it could be bitter irony or sarcasm. Jesus might also have advised conforming to the Pharisees’ teachings to avoid causing offense ([17:24–27](https://ref.ly/Matt17:24-Matt17:27)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 23:3

## Matthew 23:4 (id: 21981)

* *heavy, burdensome loads**:* According to the rabbis, there were 613 laws with commands and prohibitions (see [11:28–30](https://ref.ly/Matt11:28-Matt11:30); [Acts 15:10](https://ref.ly/Acts15:10), [28](https://ref.ly/Acts15:28)).
* *not willing to lift a finger**:* The religious leaders were not willing to ease or change these traditional laws.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 23:4

## Matthew 23:5 (id: 21982)

* *phylacteries*: Pious Jews sometimes wore small prayer boxes, called phylacteries. These were placed on the head and the upper left arm. Inside were written copies of important Old Testament commands (see [Deuteronomy 6:6–9](https://ref.ly/Deut6:6-Deut6:9); [11:18–19](https://ref.ly/Deut11:18-Deut11:19)).
* Another custom was wearing *tassels*, which were also a sign of devotion (see [Matthew 9:20](https://ref.ly/Matt9:20); see also [Numbers 15:38–41](https://ref.ly/Num15:38-Num15:41)). Some made their tassels extra long to draw attention to their religious devotion.

*Rabbi* was a title given to an authoritative and respected Jewish teacher.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 23:7

## Matthew 23:8 (id: 21986)

*Rabbi:* In Judaism, these men were authoritative mediators for sharing knowledge about God (see [Matthew 23:7](https://ref.ly/Matt23:7)). But under the new covenant, there is only one authoritative teacher, Jesus himself as the Messiah (see [Jeremiah 31:31–34](https://ref.ly/Jer31:31-Jer31:34)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 23:8

## Matthew 23:8–12 (id: 21985)

Jesus does not forbid using titles (especially for one's father). Instead, he warns against claiming undue honor when teaching about God. In the community of Jesus, everyone is equal and knows God (see [12:46–50](https://ref.ly/Matt12:46-Matt12:50); [18:15–20](https://ref.ly/Matt18:15-Matt18:20)). The titles *Rabbi*, *Father*, and *Teacher* are similar in meaning.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 23:8–MAT 23:12

## Matthew 23:9 (id: 21987)

* Later Jewish writings show that people respected teachers by calling them *Father* (see, for example, *Mishnah Eduyyoth* [1:4](https://ref.ly/Matt1:4)).
* *one Father*: See [Matthew 6:9](https://ref.ly/Matt6:9); [Malachi 2:10](https://ref.ly/Mal2:10); compare [1 Corinthians 4:15](https://ref.ly/1Cor4:15).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 23:9

## Matthew 23:10 (id: 21962)

## Matthew 23:13 (id: 21965)

* *Woe to you:* This is a distinct warning about God's judgment.
* *hypocrites!*: In English, hypocrisy means a contradiction between what is real and what seems to be real. In the Bible, it means misunderstanding God's will, misleading others, and facing God's judgment. This often includes: desire for fame and power ([Matthew 23:5–12](https://ref.ly/Matt23:5-Matt23:12)), misuse of teaching authority, false teachings ([23:13–22](https://ref.ly/Matt23:13-Matt23:22)), and focusing on minor ethical details ([23:23–28](https://ref.ly/Matt23:23-Matt23:28)).

    A suitable English word for these behaviors is *heresy*. The Pharisees and religious teachers showed these traits. As the Christian church grew, these traits continued to appear (for example, [1 Timothy 4:1–3](https://ref.ly/1Tim4:1-1Tim4:3); [2 Peter 2:1–22](https://ref.ly/2Pet2:1-2Pet2:22)). So God's children must always be on guard against them ([James 4:7–10](https://ref.ly/Jas4:7-Jas4:10); [1 Peter 2:1–3](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:1-1Pet2:3)).

* *you shut the kingdom:* This comes through their false teachings and opposition to Jesus (see [Matthew 9:32–34](https://ref.ly/Matt9:32-Matt9:34); [12:22–37](https://ref.ly/Matt12:22-Matt12:37); [15:12–14](https://ref.ly/Matt15:12-Matt15:14); [21:15](https://ref.ly/Matt21:15); [John 9:13–34](https://ref.ly/John9:13-John9:34)). The Jewish religious teachers and Pharisees stopped others from hearing and believing the truth about the Messiah.

## Matthew 23:13–36 (id: 21964)

Matthew gathered seven warnings of sorrow to come (literally *woe to you*) inspired by similar Old Testament lists ([Isaiah 5:8–23](https://ref.ly/Isa5:8-Isa5:23); [Habakkuk 2:6–20](https://ref.ly/Hab2:6-Hab2:20)). Matthew arranged them to reach a climax with the killing of the prophets.

## Matthew 23:15 (id: 21966)

* A *convert* (*proselyte*) fully accepted Judaism by performing ceremonies like baptism, sacrifice, and circumcision (see [Acts 13:43](https://ref.ly/Acts13:43)).

    A *convert* differed from a "God\-fearer." A God\-fearer was a person who accepted some Jewish beliefs, especially monotheism (belief in one God), without fully converting to Judaism (see [Luke 7:4–5](https://ref.ly/Luke7:4-Luke7:5); [Acts 10:2](https://ref.ly/Acts10:2)). *To win a single convert* likelymeans persuading God\-fearers to fully convert by becoming circumcised (compare [Galatians 2:3](https://ref.ly/Gal2:3),[14](https://ref.ly/Gal2:14); [5:2–12](https://ref.ly/Matt5:2-Matt5:12); [6:12–13](https://ref.ly/Matt6:12-Matt6:13)).

* *of hell*: The Greek word here is *Gehenna*. It was a valley outside Jerusalem used as a place of burning; See study note on Matthew 5:29.

## Matthew 23:16–22 (id: 21967)

The religious leaders said that some oaths were less binding, and this allowed them to deceive people. But Jesus called for honesty and for keeping every commitment (see [Matthew 5:33–37](https://ref.ly/Matt5:33-Matt5:37)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 23:16–MAT 23:22

## Matthew 23:23 (id: 21969)

The Jewish teachers of religious law and Pharisees believed that careful and precise tithing showed their dedication to the law. Without denying the importance of tithing*,* Jesus revealed that they completely ignored the more important parts of the law ([Isaiah 1:16–17](https://ref.ly/Isa1:16-Isa1:17); [Jeremiah 22:3](https://ref.ly/Jer22:3); [Hosea 6:6](https://ref.ly/Hos6:6); [Micah 6:8](https://ref.ly/Mic6:8); [Zechariah 7:9](https://ref.ly/Zech7:9)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 23:23

## Matthew 23:24 (id: 21970)

*gnat … camel:* In Aramaic, the language Jesus likely spoke, these two words sound similar (*qalma* … *gamla*). This makes a wordplay or pun. Jesus used the contrast between a tiny gnat and a huge camel to show the hypocrisy of focusing on small details while ignoring much greater issues.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 23:24

## Matthew 23:26 (id: 21971)

If a person is pure inside, it leads to doing the right things. But doing the right things does not make a person pure inside ([Matthew 6:19–34](https://ref.ly/Matt6:19-Matt6:34); [12:33–37](https://ref.ly/Matt12:33-Matt12:37); [15:15–20](https://ref.ly/Matt15:15-Matt15:20)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 23:26

## Matthew 23:27–28 (id: 21972)

Jewish people used to coat limestone tombs, like funerary urns or ossuaries, with a mixture of marble and lime. This filled the holes and made the tombs look nicer. It also helped visitors to Jerusalem see and avoid them, preventing contamination. Jesus did not criticize decorating tombs. Instead, he compared these whitewashed tombs to Jewish religious teachers and Pharisees. Both looked good on the outside but had contamination and impurity on the inside.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 23:27–MAT 23:28

## Matthew 23:29 (id: 21973)

By building and decorating the tombs for the prophets*,* the teachers of religious law and Pharisees showed outward support for the prophets. But inwardly they were of the same sinful character as their ancestors who had murdered the prophets.

## Matthew 23:32 (id: 21975)

*Fill up, then, the measure of the sin of your fathers*: By killing God's Messiah, they would complete Israel's history of killing God's prophets (see [1 Thessalonians 2:14–16](https://ref.ly/1Thess2:14-1Thess2:16)).

## Matthew 23:35 (id: 21976)

This covers the first and last murders recorded in the Hebrew Bible. Abel was killed in [Genesis 4:8–11](https://ref.ly/Gen4:8-Gen4:11), and Zechariah in [2 Chronicles 24:15–22](https://ref.ly/2Chr24:15-2Chr24:22), which is the last book in the Hebrew Bible order. Jesus implies that his generation would be held guilty for all the murders of God’s righteous servants in the Old Testament (compare [Matt 27:25](https://ref.ly/Matt27:25)).

## Matthew 23:37 (id: 21977)

* Even though Jesus had just given a severe judgment against Israel ([Matthew 23:29–36](https://ref.ly/Matt23:29-Matt23:36)), he truly wanted them to repent and accept God's grace.
* *as a hen:* This is an image of protective care (see also [Deuteronomy 32:11](https://ref.ly/Deut32:11); [Ruth 2:12](https://ref.ly/Ruth2:12); [Psalms 17:8](https://ref.ly/Ps17:8); [36:7](https://ref.ly/Ps36:7); [57:1](https://ref.ly/Ps57:1); [61:4](https://ref.ly/Ps61:4); [91:4](https://ref.ly/Ps91:4)).

*not one stone:* The destruction of Jerusalem and the temple showed God's judgment against Israel (see [1 Kings 9:7–9](https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:7-1Kgs9:9); [Jeremiah 7:8–15](https://ref.ly/Jer7:8-Jer7:15); [9:10–12](https://ref.ly/Jer9:10-Jer9:12); [26:6](https://ref.ly/Jer26:6), [18](https://ref.ly/Jer26:18); [Micah 3:12](https://ref.ly/Mic3:12); see also [Isaiah 64:11](https://ref.ly/Isa64:11); [Luke 19:44](https://ref.ly/Luke19:44); [Acts 6:14](https://ref.ly/Acts6:14)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 24:2

## Matthew 24:3 (id: 22014)

* The Greek word *parousia* means *coming* or *appearing*.
* *end of the age* (or *end of the world*): This phrase refers to the final end of a period in salvation history (see [Matthew 13:39–40](https://ref.ly/Matt13:39-Matt13:40), [49](https://ref.ly/Matt13:49); also [Hebrews 9:26](https://ref.ly/Heb9:26)). The second coming of Jesus will end normal history with a final judgment. The disciples believed the temple's destruction and the end of history had a close link.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 24:3

## Matthew 24:4–8 (id: 22015)

Jesus warned his disciples not to be tricked by false messiahs and not to lose hope when disasters come. These things do not mean the end has come right away. History must follow the course God has set. The signs in [Matthew 24:4–8](https://ref.ly/Matt24:4-Matt24:8) are not the end themselves but events that come before the end.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 24:4–MAT 24:8

## Matthew 24:5 (id: 22020)

*claiming, ‘I am the Christ,’:* During AD 30 to 70, many false prophets and miracle workers claimed to be the Messiah. They convinced people to follow them, promising salvation (Josephus, *Antiquities* 18\.4\.1; 20\.5\.1; 20\.8\.6; *War* 6\.5\.2\). The first known person to openly claim to be the Messiah was Bar Kochba in AD 132\. It is unclear if Jesus was talking about impostors before the temple's destruction, false messiahs throughout the church Age, or possibly during a future difficult time.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 24:5

## Matthew 24:6 (id: 22021)

* *These things must happen:* This shows that times of trouble are part of God’s plan as he moves history toward its conclusion (see [Matthew 24:7](https://ref.ly/Matt24:7), [29–30](https://ref.ly/Matt24:29-Matt24:30); [2 Thessalonians 2:8–12](https://ref.ly/2Thess2:8-2Thess2:12)).
* *the end*: This might mean the end of a period (like in AD 70\) or the end of human history as we know it (compare [Matthew 24:13–14](https://ref.ly/Matt24:13-Matt24:14); see also [10:22](https://ref.ly/Matt10:22); [13:39–40](https://ref.ly/Matt13:39-Matt13:40), [49](https://ref.ly/Matt13:49)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 24:8

## Matthew 24:9 (id: 22023)

*hated* (see [Acts 28:22](https://ref.ly/Acts28:22)): At the end of the first century, the Roman historian Tacitus described Christians as “the hated ones of mankind” (Tacitus, *Annals* 15\.44\). The suffering of righteous people sometimes has the purpose of encouraging repentance and obedience (see [Exodus 4:31](https://ref.ly/Exod4:31); [Deuteronomy 4:30](https://ref.ly/Deut4:30); [Judges 10:6–16](https://ref.ly/Judg10:6-Judg10:16); [Psalms 34:19](https://ref.ly/Ps34:19); [37:39](https://ref.ly/Ps37:39); [50:15](https://ref.ly/Ps50:15)).

## Matthew 24:13 (id: 21991)

*the one who perseveres* stays loyal to Jesus, even when persecuted. *The end* could mean the end of their life, the judgment on Israel in AD 70, or the end of history.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 24:13

## Matthew 24:14 (id: 21992)

* *in all the world:* This points to the future mission to the gentiles (see [Matthew 21:43](https://ref.ly/Matt21:43); [28:16–20](https://ref.ly/Matt28:16-Matt28:20)). Before the end comes, there will be a time, whether short or long, when the good news spreads among the nations.
* Jesus said the end will be marked by three signs. First is a *‘the abomination of desolation’* ([24:15](https://ref.ly/Matt24:15)). Second is severe persecution ([24:16–28](https://ref.ly/Matt24:16-Matt24:28)). Finally comes the sign of the Son of Man ([24:29–31](https://ref.ly/Matt24:29-Matt24:31)).

* *described by the prophet Daniel*: He spoke about the desecration (or *desolation*) of the temple (see [Daniel 8:13](https://ref.ly/Dan8:13); [9:27](https://ref.ly/Dan9:27); [11:31](https://ref.ly/Dan11:31); [12:11](https://ref.ly/Dan12:11)). It would be made unclean and ruined.
* *the abomination of desolation* could be:

    1. A false priest taking over the priesthood (see Josephus, *War* 4\.3\.6–10\).
        2. Unlawful images of God or humans, or certain people who cannot be in the temple. These people would include Antiochus Epiphanes, Caligula, Vespasian, or Titus (see Josephus, *War* 4\.4\.1–4\.7\.1\).
        3. The antichrist being present in the temple (compare *1 Maccabees* 1:54–64; *2 Maccabees* 8:17\). The term "antichrist" refers to a person or teaching that opposes Jesus Christ and his work.

* *let the reader understand:* This hidden message shows a special connection between the writer and reader, based on a shared belief that these events fulfill the prophecies of [Daniel 9](https://ref.ly/Dan9:1-Dan9:27), [11](https://ref.ly/Dan11:1-Dan11:45), and [12](https://ref.ly/Dan12:1-Dan12:13).

## Matthew 24:20 (id: 21995)

* The Jewish historian Josephus records that the Jordan River swells in winter, making it harder to cross (see *War* 4\.7\.5\). Muddy roads also made travel difficult in winter.
* Jews usually did not travel on the Sabbath, so that they could rest as God commanded (see [Genesis 2:1–3](https://ref.ly/Gen2:1-Gen2:3); [Exodus 20:8–11](https://ref.ly/Exod20:8-Exod20:11); [23:12](https://ref.ly/Exod23:12); [31:12–17](https://ref.ly/Exod31:12-Exod31:17); [Leviticus 23:3](https://ref.ly/Lev23:3); [Deuteronomy 5:12–15](https://ref.ly/Deut5:12-Deut5:15); [Jeremiah 17:19–27](https://ref.ly/Jer17:19-Jer17:27)).

*Lightning* here may point to the great cosmic signs that will mark the coming of the Messiah (see [Matthew 24:29–31](https://ref.ly/Matt24:29-Matt24:31); [1 Thessalonians 4:13–18](https://ref.ly/1Thess4:13-1Thess4:18)). The focus is on how easy the *lightning* is to see, not how suddenly it comes. Jesus probably shared these teachings to prevent early excitement about the end of time ([1 Thessalonians 4:13–5:10](https://ref.ly/1Thess4:13-1Thess5:10); [2 Thessalonians 2:1–12](https://ref.ly/2Thess2:1-2Thess2:12)).

## Matthew 24:29 (id: 22003)

*‘The sun will be darkened … the heavens will be shaken*.’*:* This could be literal, as is fitting for a dramatic revelation of God's Son. Or, it could be a metaphor for a major cosmic event (see [Acts 2:17–21](https://ref.ly/Acts2:17-Acts2:21); [Hebrews 12:26–27](https://ref.ly/Heb12:26-Heb12:27); [2 Peter 3:10](https://ref.ly/2Pet3:10); [Revelation 6:12–13](https://ref.ly/Rev6:12-Rev6:13)). The Old Testament often uses similar apocalyptic language to describe political disasters and the collapse of governments as cosmic judgments from God (for example, [Isaiah 13:9–16](https://ref.ly/Isa13:9-Isa13:16); [Ezekiel 32:1–10](https://ref.ly/Ezek32:1-Ezek32:10); [Joel 2:1–17](https://ref.ly/Joel2:1-Joel2:17); [Amos 8:7–10](https://ref.ly/Amos8:7-Amos8:10)).

## Matthew 24:29–31 (id: 22002)

These sayings indicate the most important part of the discussion and answer the second question the disciples asked (see [Matthew 24:3](https://ref.ly/Matt24:3)). Some believe [24:29–31](https://ref.ly/Matt24:29-Matt24:31) describes God's judgment on the Jewish people in AD 70\. In this view, the apocalyptic images and metaphors picture the destruction of Jerusalem.

Others see these verses as pointing to the second coming of Christ at the end of history.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 24:29–MAT 24:31

## Matthew 24:30 (id: 22005)

* *the sign of the Son of Man:* The sign is probably the Son of Man himself (see [Matthew 12:38–42](https://ref.ly/Matt12:38-Matt12:42); [16:4](https://ref.ly/Matt16:4)). His coming shows that God has vindicated him (proved him right; see [26:64](https://ref.ly/Matt26:64)). It will also cause deep mourning for those who face God’s judgment.
* *all the tribes of the earth:* This could also mean "all the tribes of the land." The Greek term used here (*phulai*) often refers to the tribes of Israel. It is not the usual term for gentiles (*ethnoi*). This suggests that it may refer to a national disaster in Israel (see [Matthew 21:43](https://ref.ly/Matt21:43); [Zechariah 12:10–14](https://ref.ly/Zech12:10-Zech12:14)).
* *the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven*: See[Daniel 7:13](https://ref.ly/Dan7:13). Many think this means the Son of Man will descend from God's presence to live on earth as judge and savior. This is the second coming of Christ. Others believe it describes the Son of Man coming in judgment, but not necessarily as the second coming of Christ (see [Matthew 10:23](https://ref.ly/Matt10:23); [16:27](https://ref.ly/Matt16:27); [19:28](https://ref.ly/Matt19:28); [25:31](https://ref.ly/Matt25:31); [26:64](https://ref.ly/Matt26:64); [28:18](https://ref.ly/Matt28:18)).

Others think the word *angeloi* (Greek for “messengers”) here refers to human messengers ([11:10](https://ref.ly/Matt11:10); [Luke 7:24](https://ref.ly/Luke7:24); [9:52](https://ref.ly/Luke9:52); [James 2:25](https://ref.ly/Jas2:25)). In this view, Jesus is describing the spread of the good news among the gentiles (see [Matthew 21:33–46](https://ref.ly/Matt21:33-Matt21:46); [22:1–14](https://ref.ly/Matt22:1-Matt22:14); [Deuteronomy 30:1–10](https://ref.ly/Deut30:1-Deut30:10); [Isaiah 27:13](https://ref.ly/Isa27:13); [Zechariah 2:6–13](https://ref.ly/Zech2:6-Zech2:13)).

* *all these things:* This refers to events connected to the destruction of the temple. This phrase is first used in [Matthew 23:36](https://ref.ly/Matt23:36) (see [24:2](https://ref.ly/Matt24:2), [8](https://ref.ly/Matt24:8)).
* *He is near* (or *it is near*): It could mean the return of Jesus (see [James 5:9](https://ref.ly/Jas5:9); [Revelation 3:20](https://ref.ly/Rev3:20)), the destruction of the temple, or the end of history (see [Luke 21:31](https://ref.ly/Luke21:31)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 24:33

## Matthew 24:34 (id: 22008)

*this generation:* In Matthew, *generation* refers particularly to the current Jews who do not trust in Jesus. This focuses especially on the leaders who have tried to make the people reject the Messiah ([Matthew 11:16](https://ref.ly/Matt11:16); [12:39](https://ref.ly/Matt12:39), [41–42](https://ref.ly/Matt12:41-Matt12:42), [45](https://ref.ly/Matt12:45); [16:4](https://ref.ly/Matt16:4); [23:36](https://ref.ly/Matt23:36)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 24:34

## Matthew 24:35 (id: 22009)

The words of Jesus are as reliable as the words of God (see [Matthew 5:18](https://ref.ly/Matt5:18); [Isaiah 40:8](https://ref.ly/Isa40:8); [55:11](https://ref.ly/Isa55:11); [59:21](https://ref.ly/Isa59:21)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 24:35

## Matthew 24:36 (id: 22010)

* *That day* is the day of judgment.
* *nor the Son:* This phrase shows that Jesus did not know the exact time. [Acts 1:7](https://ref.ly/Acts1:7) suggests the same idea. Because no one knows the day, Jesus told his followers to stay watchful and faithful (see [Matthew 24:37–25:46](https://ref.ly/Matt24:37-Matt25:46)). This statement should discourage anyone from trying to calculate the exact date when our Lord will return.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 24:36

## Matthew 24:37 (id: 22013)

* *at the coming of the Son of Man**:* This refers to the second coming of Jesus (see [Matthew 24:3](https://ref.ly/Matt24:3); compare [Luke 17:26](https://ref.ly/Luke17:26)).
* *in the days of Noah* (see [Genesis 6:9–22](https://ref.ly/Gen6:9-Gen6:22); [2 Peter 2:5](https://ref.ly/2Pet2:5); [3:5–6](https://ref.ly/2Pet3:5-2Pet3:6)): This is not comparing how serious the sins were. Instead, it shows that people did not notice what God was doing. They were too focused on everyday pleasures and celebrations ([Matthew 6:19–34](https://ref.ly/Matt6:19-Matt6:34)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 24:37

## Matthew 24:37–41 (id: 22012)

The second coming of Jesus will surprise people, just like the flood of Noah did ([Genesis 7](https://ref.ly/Gen7:1-Gen7:24)). The only way to be ready is to live consistently alert and obedient (compare [Luke 17:26–27](https://ref.ly/Luke17:26-Luke17:27), [34–35](https://ref.ly/Luke17:34-Luke17:35)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 24:37–MAT 24:41

## Matthew 24:37–25.46 (id: 22011)

Jesus now applied his prophecies ([Matthew 24:1–36](https://ref.ly/Matt24:1-Matt24:36)) to his disciples so they would stay faithful and be ready for his second coming.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 24:37–MAT 25:46

## Matthew 24:40–41 (id: 22016)

The word *taken* most likely means taken in judgment, either in AD 70 or at the end of history. *Left* would then mean remaining to enter a new time. This new time could be the age of the church (see [21:43](https://ref.ly/Matt21:43); [22:1–14](https://ref.ly/Matt22:1-Matt22:14)) or the thousand–year reign of Christ on earth (the Millennium).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 24:40–MAT 24:41

## Matthew 24:42 (id: 22017)

*keep watch:* This means to actively and energetically obey the Lord with a single focus (see [Matthew 25:13](https://ref.ly/Matt25:13); [26:38–41](https://ref.ly/Matt26:38-Matt26:41)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 24:42

## Matthew 24:45 (id: 22019)

*servant:* Those who were listening to Jesus might have thought of God's special servants, the prophets and lawgivers. But Jesus often used *servant* as a metaphor, so it is likely he was describing every disciple's responsibility (see [Matthew 10:24–25](https://ref.ly/Matt10:24-Matt10:25); [13:27–28](https://ref.ly/Matt13:27-Matt13:28); [18:23–35](https://ref.ly/Matt18:23-Matt18:35); [20:26](https://ref.ly/Matt20:26)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 24:45

## Matthew 24:45–51 (id: 22018)

This parable and the next three dramatize the importance of faithfully obeying while waiting for Jesus to return ([Matthew 25:1–13](https://ref.ly/Matt25:1-Matt25:13), [14–30](https://ref.ly/Matt25:14-Matt25:30), [31–46](https://ref.ly/Matt25:31-Matt25:46)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 24:45–MAT 24:51

## Matthew 25:1 (id: 22027)

* *to meet the bridegroom:* This image points to the coming of the Messiah (see [Mark 2:19–20](https://ref.ly/Mark2:19-Mark2:20)).
* We do not know the exact wedding customs of that time. Some believe the bridesmaids led the bride to the bridegroom's home. He stayed away until the wedding feast began. The bridesmaidswould wait for his arrival and then escort him to the feast ([Matthew 25:10](https://ref.ly/Matt25:10)).

    Others think the bridegroom might have arrived late at night at the bride’s home, where they announced him. After celebrating with the bride’s guests, the groom would take his bride to his home under torches or lamps.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 25:1

## Matthew 25:1–13 (id: 22024)

This parable confirms the need to be alert and ready for Christ's return ([Matthew 25:13](https://ref.ly/Matt25:13); see also [Luke 12:35–36](https://ref.ly/Luke12:35-Luke12:36)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 25:1–MAT 25:13

## Matthew 25:3 (id: 22037)

Some people think the *oil* represents something specific (such as the Holy Spirit). But it more likely emphasizes the need to prepare for Christ's second coming.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 25:3

## Matthew 25:5 (id: 22040)

Both the prudent and the foolish bridesmaids sleep while waiting. The parable criticizes only the foolish bridesmaids’ failure to bring enough oil.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 25:5

## Matthew 25:6 (id: 22041)

The bridegroom arriving at midnight while the bridesmaids slept makes a further point: the second coming of Jesus will be sudden and unexpected ([Matthew 14:42–51](https://ref.ly/Matt24:42-Matt24:51)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 25:6

## Matthew 25:14–30 (id: 22025)

This parable teaches that the Lord expects his servants to be faithful to the task given to them while waiting for his return. The delay of Christ’s return will cause some to do evil things ([Matthew 24:48–49](https://ref.ly/Matt24:48-Matt24:49)), some to become inactive ([25:3](https://ref.ly/Matt25:3)), and others may become fearfully passive ([25:18](https://ref.ly/Matt25:18)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 25:14–MAT 25:30

## Matthew 25:19 (id: 22026)

*After a long time:* This emphasizes the long wait for Christ's return ([Matthew 24:45–51](https://ref.ly/Matt24:45-Matt24:51)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 25:19

## Matthew 25:21 (id: 22028)

* See [Matthew 24:45–51](https://ref.ly/Matt24:45-Matt24:51); [Luke 16:10](https://ref.ly/Luke16:10).
* *Enter into the joy of your master!:*This shows the Father’s approval. It may also point to the Messiah’s great banquet (see [Matthew 6:1](https://ref.ly/Matt6:1), [4](https://ref.ly/Matt6:4), [6](https://ref.ly/Matt6:6), [18](https://ref.ly/Matt6:18); [9:9–17](https://ref.ly/Matt9:9-Matt9:17)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 25:21

## Matthew 25:24 (id: 22029)

*I knew that you are a hard man**:* This servant uses a false understanding of his master as an excuse for being lazy.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 25:24

## Matthew 25:29 (id: 22030)

God gives plenty of grace to those who are faithful with what they already have (see [Matthew 13:12](https://ref.ly/Matt13:12)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 25:29

## Matthew 25:31 (id: 22032)

*sit on His glorious throne:* This represents a position of judgment (see [Matthew 19:28](https://ref.ly/Matt19:28); [22:44](https://ref.ly/Matt22:44); [Daniel 7:13–14](https://ref.ly/Dan7:13-Dan7:14)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 25:31

## Matthew 25:31–46 (id: 22031)

This describes the final judgment of which Jesus had been warning (see [Matthew 7:13–27](https://ref.ly/Matt7:13-Matt7:27); [8:10–12](https://ref.ly/Matt8:10-Matt8:12); [11:20–24](https://ref.ly/Matt11:20-Matt11:24); [12:38–42](https://ref.ly/Matt12:38-Matt12:42); [13:24–30](https://ref.ly/Matt13:24-Matt13:30), [36–43](https://ref.ly/Matt13:36-Matt13:43); [16:24–28](https://ref.ly/Matt16:24-Matt16:28); [24:37–25:30](https://ref.ly/Matt24:37-Matt25:30)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 25:31–MAT 25:46

## Matthew 25:33 (id: 22033)

*His right hand:* This is a place of honor ([Genesis 48:13–20](https://ref.ly/Gen48:13-Gen48:20); [Psalm 110:1](https://ref.ly/Ps110:1)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 25:33

## Matthew 25:34 (id: 22034)

*prepared for you from the foundation of the world**:* This phrase might be a reference to God choosing people for salvation before time began (see [Matthew 13:10–17](https://ref.ly/Matt13:10-Matt13:17); [Ephesians 1:4](https://ref.ly/Eph1:4); [Revelation 17:8](https://ref.ly/Rev17:8)). Or it might only refer to the God's kingdom as a place (compare [Matthew 25:41](https://ref.ly/Matt25:41)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 25:34

## Matthew 25:35–36 (id: 22035)

The actions mentioned here are often called "deeds of mercy." These were acts of kindness toward those in need (see [Isaiah 58:1–12](https://ref.ly/Isa58:1-Isa58:12); [Ezekiel 18:7](https://ref.ly/Ezek18:7); [James 1:26–27](https://ref.ly/Jas1:26-Jas1:27)). These good deeds are not efforts to earn God's approval. Instead, they come from a love for Christ that results in compassion toward others (see [Matthew 6:1–4](https://ref.ly/Matt6:1-Matt6:4)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 25:35–MAT 25:36

## Matthew 25:37 (id: 22036)

These *righteous* people (see [Mathhew 5:6](https://ref.ly/Matt5:6), [20](https://ref.ly/Matt5:20)) obey God's will as Jesus taught them. They show this most clearly through acts of love ([7:12](https://ref.ly/Matt7:12); [9:9–13](https://ref.ly/Matt9:9-Matt9:13); [22:34–40](https://ref.ly/Matt22:34-Matt22:40); [25:35–40](https://ref.ly/Matt25:35-Matt25:40)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 25:37

## Matthew 25:40 (id: 22038)

*these brothers of Mine:* This phrase may show the close bond Jesus had with his disciples (see [10:42](https://ref.ly/Matt10:42); [18:1–14](https://ref.ly/Matt18:1-Matt18:14); [Galatians 6:10](https://ref.ly/Gal6:10)). Or it could refer to all humanity, regardless of their faith (see [Matthew 6:1–4](https://ref.ly/Matt6:1-Matt6:4); [25:43](https://ref.ly/Matt25:43); [Proverbs 19:17](https://ref.ly/Prov19:17)). The phrase *brothers of Mine* suggests the first meaning ([Matthew 12:46–50](https://ref.ly/Matt12:46-Matt12:50); [18:15–35](https://ref.ly/Matt18:15-Matt18:35); [23:8](https://ref.ly/Matt23:8); [28:10](https://ref.ly/Matt28:10)). But it does not exclude the duty to care for others in general (see [Luke 10:30–37](https://ref.ly/Luke10:30-Luke10:37)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 25:40

## Matthew 25:46 (id: 22039)

The Greek word for *eternal* can mean "lasting forever" or "lasting for an age." It refers to "the age to come" ([Matthew 13:39–40](https://ref.ly/Matt13:39-Matt13:40), [49](https://ref.ly/Matt13:49); [24:3](https://ref.ly/Matt24:3); [John 17:3](https://ref.ly/John17:3); [2 Thessalonians 1:9](https://ref.ly/2Thess1:9); [Philemon 1:15](https://ref.ly/Phlm1:15); [1 John 5:11](https://ref.ly/1John5:11), [13](https://ref.ly/1John5:13)). 

Some hope that the punishment of the damned will end after "an age." God will either destroy or forgive them. Yet, the comparison between *eternal life* and *eternal punishment* strongly suggests it means "lasting forever." This is because *eternal life* does not end (see also [Luke 16:19–31](https://ref.ly/Luke16:19-Luke16:31); [Hebrews 6:2](https://ref.ly/Heb6:2); [Revelation 20:10](https://ref.ly/Rev20:10)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 25:46

## Matthew 26:2 (id: 22053)

The irony is that the Son of Man, who will one day judge the nations ([Matthew 25:31–46](https://ref.ly/Matt25:31-Matt25:46)), must first be unfairly judged and condemned to death by evil people. The death of Jesus was the ultimate Passover sacrifice (see [John 19:31–37](https://ref.ly/John19:31-John19:37); [1 Corinthians 5:7](https://ref.ly/1Cor5:7)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 26:2

## Matthew 26:3 (id: 22063)

* *Caiaphas* was the high priest. He lived near the temple in Jerusalem's upper city. This meeting was not at the usual place or time, so it was urgent and probably secret. The Sanhedrin (the official Jewish council) usually met in the council chamber. The council chamber was located either at the southern end of the court of the Israelites in the temple or on the western edge of the temple hill.
* Joseph Caiaphas was the son\-in\-law of Annas (see [John 18:13](https://ref.ly/John18:13)). He served as high priest from AD 18 to 36 ([John 11:49](https://ref.ly/John11:49)). He had the longest term of any high priest from Herod's rule until AD 70\. They had removed Annas, his father\-in\-law, from his position but he was still called high priest as well (see [Luke 3:2](https://ref.ly/Luke3:2); [John 18:13](https://ref.ly/John18:13), [19–24](https://ref.ly/John18:19-John18:24)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 26:3

## Matthew 26:5 (id: 22074)

At Passover, Jerusalem was crowded with pilgrims. The Jewish leaders feared losing their authority if they caused or permitted anything that looked like a revolt against Rome (see [Matthew 21:8–11](https://ref.ly/Matt21:8-Matt21:11), [14–16](https://ref.ly/Matt21:14-Matt21:16)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 26:5

## Matthew 26:6 (id: 22083)

Simon was a man who had once suffered from leprosy. Jesus being in his home showed the forgiving and healing love that Jesus often gave to people who were outcasts (see [8:7](https://ref.ly/Matt8:7); [9:10](https://ref.ly/Matt9:10)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 26:6

## Matthew 26:6–13 (id: 22075)

A similar anointing happened earlier in Galilee ([Luke 7:36–50](https://ref.ly/Luke7:36-Luke7:50)). Matthew includes this event here (compare [John 12:1–8](https://ref.ly/John12:1-John12:8)) to highlight different responses to Jesus. While the Jewish leaders were plotting to kill Jesus ([Matthew 26:3–5](https://ref.ly/Matt26:3-Matt26:5)) and Judas was preparing to betray him ([26:14–16](https://ref.ly/Matt26:14-Matt26:16)), the woman honored Jesus with her actions.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 26:6–MAT 26:13

## Matthew 26:7 (id: 22086)

The jar of costly perfume was used for burial customs (see [Mark 16:1](https://ref.ly/Mark16:1); [Luke 23:56–24:1](https://ref.ly/Luke23:56-Luke24:1); [John 12:1–7](https://ref.ly/John12:1-John12:7); [19:38–42](https://ref.ly/John19:38-John19:42)). It was made from nard, a plant harvested in India. The perfume was worth almost a full year’s wages([John 12:5](https://ref.ly/John12:5)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 26:7

## Matthew 26:8 (id: 22087)

*they were indignant:* [John 12:4](https://ref.ly/John12:4) shows that Judas Iscariot caused this reaction.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 26:8

## Matthew 26:12 (id: 22042)

*prepared My body for burial**:* We do not know if the woman fully understood what she was doing. The anointing also symbolizes Jesus as king and priest ([1 Samuel 10:1](https://ref.ly/1Sam10:1); [2 Kings 9:6](https://ref.ly/2Kgs9:6); [Exodus 29:7](https://ref.ly/Exod29:7)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 26:12

## Matthew 26:14–16 (id: 22043)

Judas sold himself to the authorities (see also [John 11:57](https://ref.ly/John11:57)), kept it secret ([Matthew 26:25](https://ref.ly/Matt26:25)), and led them to Jesus at the right time to arrest him ([26:47–56](https://ref.ly/Matt26:47-Matt26:56); see [John 18:2](https://ref.ly/John18:2)). Later, feeling guilty, Judas killed himself ([Matthew 27:3–10](https://ref.ly/Matt27:3-Matt27:10); see [Acts 1:15–22](https://ref.ly/Acts1:15-Acts1:22)). 

Judas was known for his greed ([Matthew 26:14–15](https://ref.ly/Matt26:14-Matt26:15); [John 12:4–6](https://ref.ly/John12:4-John12:6); [13:29](https://ref.ly/John13:29)). Some think he may also have been disappointed in the kind of Messiah Jesus was, ashamed after the anointing of Jesus (see [John 12:1–8](https://ref.ly/John12:1-John12:8)). Others think he may have been resentful of the leadership of Peter, James, and John. Whatever his reasons, Judas’s betrayal was still part of God’s larger plan ([Acts 1:16–17](https://ref.ly/Acts1:16-Acts1:17)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 26:14–MAT 26:16

## Matthew 26:18 (id: 22044)

*My time:* The Messiah would now complete the work for which he was commissioned, to die for the sins of the world.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 26:18

## Matthew 26:23 (id: 22045)

*dipped his hand into the bowl with Me**:* Everyone would dip their food into a shared bowl, which probably had herbs and fruit puree in it. Sharing a meal showed friendship and trust, so having a betrayer there was shocking ([Matthew 26:21](https://ref.ly/Matt26:21); but see [John 13:26](https://ref.ly/John13:26)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 26:23

## Matthew 26:24 (id: 22046)

*as it is written:* Jesus might have been referring to [Isaiah 53:7–9](https://ref.ly/Isa53:7-Isa53:9) or the broader Old Testament theme of a suffering Messiah. This verse shows both God's sovereign will and human responsibility.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 26:24

## Matthew 26:25 (id: 22047)

* Judas referred to Jesus as *Rabbi*, but the other disciples call him "Lord" ([Mathhew 26:22](https://ref.ly/Matt26:22)).
* *You have said it yourself:* This mysterious statement confirmed that Judas was the betrayer.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 26:25

## Matthew 26:26 (id: 22049)

* [Deuteronomy 16:3](https://ref.ly/Deut16:3) calls the unleavened bread of the Passover (see [Exodus 12:18](https://ref.ly/Exod12:18)) the "bread of affliction." This is because it symbolizes the hardships in Egypt.
* During the Passover meal, the traditional blessing over the bread is: "Blessed are you, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who brings forth bread from the earth."

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 26:26

## Matthew 26:26–29 (id: 22048)

* The Last Supper is important partly because of its connection to the Jewish Passover (see [Exodus 12](https://ref.ly/Exod12:1-Exod12:51)).

    The steps of the Jewish liturgy for Passover are as follows:

    1. Festive blessing;
        2. first cup (see [Luke 22:17–18](https://ref.ly/Luke22:17-Luke22:18));
        3. eating bitter herbs (see [Matt 26:23](https://ref.ly/Matt26:23) and corresponding study note);
        4. eating unleavened bread ([26:26](https://ref.ly/Matt26:26); [Mark 14:22](https://ref.ly/Mark14:22));
        5. mixing the second cup;
        6. reading the Passover *haggadah* (this is a retelling of the Exodus story, [Exodus 12](https://ref.ly/Exod12:1-Exod12:51));
        7. first part of the *hallel* (songs of praise, [Psalms 113–114](https://ref.ly/Ps113:1-Ps114:8); see study note on Psalms 113–118);
        8. drinking the second cup;
        9. blessing and eating unleavened bread ([Matt 26:26](https://ref.ly/Matt26:26); [Mark 14:22](https://ref.ly/Mark14:22); [Luke 22:19](https://ref.ly/Luke22:19));
        10. eating the Passover lamb;
        11. third cup ([Matt 26:27–28](https://ref.ly/Matt26:27-Matt26:28); [Mark 14:23–24](https://ref.ly/Mark14:23-Mark14:24); [Luke 22:20](https://ref.ly/Luke22:20));
        12. fourth cup (see [Matt 26:29](https://ref.ly/Matt26:29)\[?]; [Mark 14:25](https://ref.ly/Mark14:25)\[?]);
        13. time for fellowship;
        14. second part of the *hallel* ([Psalms 115–118](https://ref.ly/Ps115:1-Ps118:29); see [Matthew 26:30](https://ref.ly/Matt26:30)).
        The New Testament stories of the Last Supper do not include every part of a typical Jewish Passover. Yet, they include the key parts that gave meaning to the early Christian celebration of the Lord’s Supper or Eucharist (see [1 Corinthians 11:23–25](https://ref.ly/1Cor11:23-1Cor11:25)). Jesus, the Lamb of God, is the ultimate Passover lamb and the perfect sacrifice for sin.

* *this is My body … My blood:* Ever since the Protestant Reformation, there have been three main interpretations of the words of Jesus about the bread and wine:

    1. Transubstantiation: The bread and wine are believed to change into the actual body and blood of Christ, while still appearing to be bread and wine.
        2. Real Presence: Christ is understood to be truly present in the sacrament in a mysterious but real way that is beyond human understanding.
        3. Memorial or Symbolic View: The bread and wine are seen as symbols. The act of sharing them recalls Christ’s death and resurrection, and believers receive spiritual benefit through faith.

## Matthew 26:27 (id: 22050)

* *gave thanks:* The traditional blessing for the Passover cup was “Blessed are you, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who creates the fruit of the vine.” An early Christian version is “We give thanks to you, our Father, for the Holy Vine of David, your child, whom you revealed to us through Jesus your child; glory be to you forever” (*Didache* 9\.2\).
* The four cups of the Passover meal match the four promises in [Exodus 6:6–7](https://ref.ly/Exod6:6-Exod6:7): two for deliverance, one for redemption (see [Matthew 26:27–28](https://ref.ly/Matt26:27-Matt26:28)), and one for fellowship (see [26:29](https://ref.ly/Matt26:29)).

## Matthew 26:28 (id: 22051)

* *the covenant:* In God’s covenant with Israel, the blood of sheep or goats was shed and put on the doorposts at Passover ([Exodus 12:5](https://ref.ly/Exod12:5), [13](https://ref.ly/Exod12:13); [24:8](https://ref.ly/Exod24:8)). They put it on the "the sides and tops of the doorframes" ([Exodus 12:7](https://ref.ly/Exod12:7)). Jesus, the sinless Lamb of God, created a new *covenant* with his blood (see [Jeremiah 31:31](https://ref.ly/Jer31:31)). The *covenant* represents God's self\-initiated promise to bring salvation to humanity, fulfilling the promise to the patriarch Abraham (see [Genesis 12](https://ref.ly/Gen12:1-Gen12:20); [Galatians 3:15–29](https://ref.ly/Gal3:15-Gal3:29); [4:12–31](https://ref.ly/Gal4:12-Gal4:31)).
* *for many for the forgiveness of sins:* Jesus shed his blood as a sacrifice to forgive *sins* (see [Jeremiah 31:31–34](https://ref.ly/Jer31:31-Jer31:34); [Mark 14:24](https://ref.ly/Mark14:24)). Some think *many* means only God's chosen people, while others believe it means "all" (compare [Matthew 20:28](https://ref.ly/Matt20:28)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 26:28

## Matthew 26:29 (id: 22052)

* *until that day:* The kingdom of God began with the ministry of Jesus, but it is not yet complete. It still awaits its full completion at the end (see [1 Corinthians 15:20–28](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:20-1Cor15:28); [Revelation 19–22](https://ref.ly/Rev19:1-Rev22:21)).
* *until that day when I drink it anew:* Jesus describes the final completion of the kingdom as a great feast, like the Passover. This picture shows eternal fellowship with God and his people, marked by love and peace.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 26:30

## Matthew 26:31 (id: 22055)

*I will strike:* In [Zechariah 13:7–9](https://ref.ly/Zech13:7-Zech13:9), a sword strikes God's partner, the Shepherd. Jesus understood this as a prophecy of his own death. From the scattered sheep, a purified group of faithful ones will emerge ([Zechariah 13:8–9](https://ref.ly/Zech13:8-Zech13:9)). In the short term, the disciples would soon scatter and deny knowing Jesus ([Matthew 26:34](https://ref.ly/Matt26:34), [56](https://ref.ly/Matt26:56), [69–75](https://ref.ly/Matt26:69-Matt26:75)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 26:31

## Matthew 26:32 (id: 22056)

Jesus prophesied a time when the disciples would return, even though they were about to leave him (see chapter [Matthew 28](https://ref.ly/Matt28:1-Matt28:20); [John 21](https://ref.ly/John21:1-John21:25)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 26:32

## Matthew 26:36 (id: 22059)

*Gethsemane* is an olive orchard about 229 meters (about 250 yards) east of Jerusalem's Golden Gate. It is above the Kidron Valley on the Mount of Olives. Jesus and his disciples often met there ([Luke 22:39–40](https://ref.ly/Luke22:39-Luke22:40); [John 18:1–2](https://ref.ly/John18:1-John18:2)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 26:36

## Matthew 26:36–46 (id: 22058)

This scene reveals how deeply Jesus understood the suffering he would encounter on the cross. It also reveals his complete dedication to God's will (see [Matthew 20:28](https://ref.ly/Matt20:28)). The words in [26:41–42](https://ref.ly/Matt26:41-Matt26:42) echo the Lord’s Prayer in [6:9–13](https://ref.ly/Matt6:9-Matt6:13).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 26:36–MAT 26:46

## Matthew 26:37 (id: 22060)

* *He took with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee:* Peter, James, and John were probably the leaders of the apostles. They received special revelation (Peter, James, and John were present at the Transfiguration, where they saw Jesus transformed on the mountain, [Matthew 17:1–13](https://ref.ly/Matt17:1-Matt17:13)). They stayed with Jesus during this difficult time.
* Jesus felt *sorrow* and *distress* as he thought about the Father’s plan for him (see [Matthew 27:45–46](https://ref.ly/Matt27:45-Matt27:46)). Though he had never sinned, Jesus would take on humanity’s sin so that people could become "the righteousness of God" in Jesus ([2 Corinthians 5:21](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:21)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 26:37

## Matthew 26:39 (id: 22062)

* *if it is possible:* Jesus desired to obey the Father fully while dreading the suffering and judgment he was about to bear.

* As Jesus had predicted earlier that evening, all the disciples adandoned him ([Matthew 26:31–35](https://ref.ly/Matt26:31-Matt26:35)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 26:56

## Matthew 26:57–68 (id: 22071)

This hearing was probably an informal meeting to agree on the charges. The Jewish leaders faced pressure to keep the hearing secret to avoid a riot (see [Matthew 21:26](https://ref.ly/Matt21:26), [46](https://ref.ly/Matt21:46); [26:5](https://ref.ly/Matt26:5), [55](https://ref.ly/Matt26:55); [John 11:45–53](https://ref.ly/John11:45-John11:53)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 26:57–MAT 26:68

## Matthew 26:57–27.26 (id: 22070)

The Gospels describe Jesus having five legal hearings: 

1. an informal hearing with Annas ([John 18:13–24](https://ref.ly/John18:13-John18:24));
2. a night hearing with the Sanhedrin ([Matthew 26:59–66](https://ref.ly/Matt26:59-Matt26:66));
3. a morning hearing with the Sanhedrin ([Matthew 27:1–2](https://ref.ly/Matt27:1-Matt27:2));
4. a hearing with Herod Antipas ([Luke 23:6–12](https://ref.ly/Luke23:6-Luke23:12)); and
5. a two\-part trial with Pilate ([Matthew 27:11–31](https://ref.ly/Matt27:11-Matt27:31); see [Luke 23:6–12](https://ref.ly/Luke23:6-Luke23:12)).

These hearings form two main trials, a Jewish trial and a Roman trial.

*the courtyard of the high priest**:* This place indicates an unplanned meeting of the Sanhedrin at the high priest's palace ([Matthew 26:3](https://ref.ly/Matt26:3)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 26:58

## Matthew 26:59 (id: 22073)

*were seeking false testimony:* The verb tense suggests a long and possibly desperate attempt to find any testimony to support a formal accusation (see [Mark 14:55–56](https://ref.ly/Mark14:55-Mark14:56)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 26:59

## Matthew 26:60 (id: 22076)

*they did not find any:* This was because the evidence was too weak or inconsistent to seek a death sentence. This changed when two men gave testimonies that matched ([Deuteronomy 17:6](https://ref.ly/Deut17:6); [19:15](https://ref.ly/Deut19:15)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 26:60

## Matthew 26:61 (id: 22077)

The charge was either a misunderstanding or a deliberate misrepresentation of what Jesus had said about his death and resurrection (see [John 2:19–21](https://ref.ly/John2:19-John2:21)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 26:61

## Matthew 26:63 (id: 22078)

*if You are the Christ:* The high priest asked this because [Zechariah 6:12](https://ref.ly/Zech6:12) prophesied that the Christ (Messiah) would rebuild the temple (compare [Matthew 26:61](https://ref.ly/Matt26:61)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 26:63

## Matthew 26:64 (id: 22079)

* *You have said it yourself:* This was a careful but clear “yes” (see [Matthew 26:25](https://ref.ly/Matt26:25); [27:11](https://ref.ly/Matt27:11)). In Mark’s account Jesus answers, “I Am” ([Mark 14:62](https://ref.ly/Mark14:62)).
* *you will see:* By quoting [Daniel 7:13](https://ref.ly/Dan7:13), Jesus confirmed he was the Son of Man who God would vindicate and honor.
* *sitting at the right hand of Power:* See [Psalm 110:1](https://ref.ly/Ps110:1). Jews often avoided saying God's name directly (see study note on Matthew 5:4).
* The phrase *coming on the clouds of heaven* might refer to the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70 or to the return of Jesus at the end of history.

*He has blasphemed:* Caiaphas thought Jesus had spoken against God (blasphemed) when Jesus claimed to be the Son of Man. The title "Son of Man" was very special. It described someone who shared God's glory and power ([Daniel 7:13–14](https://ref.ly/Dan7:13-Dan7:14)).

This abuse fulfills the prophecies in [Isaiah 50:6](https://ref.ly/Isa50:6) and [53:4–9](https://ref.ly/Isa53:4-Isa53:9). Jesus himself prophesied these things ([Matthew 16:21](https://ref.ly/Matt16:21); [17:22–23](https://ref.ly/Matt17:22-Matt17:23); [20:18–19](https://ref.ly/Matt20:18-Matt20:19); [26:2](https://ref.ly/Matt26:2); see also [Mark 14:65](https://ref.ly/Mark14:65)).

## Matthew 27:1 (id: 22094)

The Jewish leaders said Jesus had spoken blasphemy ([26:65–66](https://ref.ly/Matt26:65-Matt26:66)). That charge was enough for the death penalty under Jewish law, but it would not persuade a Roman judge. So the leading priests and elders worked together to create a political charge that would fit Roman law on capital offenses (see [27:11–26](https://ref.ly/Matt27:11-Matt27:26); [Luke 23:2](https://ref.ly/Luke23:2)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 27:1

## Matthew 27:1–2 (id: 22088)

The Jewish leaders prepared charges against Jesus so that Pilate would order his death. Pilate was a gentile, and by condemning Jesus he fulfilled Jesus prediction ([Matthew 20:19](https://ref.ly/Matt20:19)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 27:1–MAT 27:2

## Matthew 27:2 (id: 22101)

Tiberius Caesar made Pilate the governor (or prefect) of Judea. Pilate mainly governed from Caesarea, not Jerusalem, from AD 26 to AD 36\. Although he had full power in Judea, Pilate answered to the governor (or legate) of Syria. This man was the main authority in the eastern Roman Empire. The Jewish historian Josephus records several mentions of Pilate. Pilate's disrespect for the holiness of Jewish customs caused revolts.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 27:2

## Matthew 27:3 (id: 22109)

Judas felt deep remorse (the Greek word *metamelomai*), but he did not repent (the Greek word *metanoeō*). Repentance would have changed his heart and led to obedience and a relationship with God through faith.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 27:3

## Matthew 27:3–10 (id: 22102)

There are two stories about Judas's death. This one and the one found in [Acts 1:18–19](https://ref.ly/Acts1:18-Acts1:19). There are differences between the two stories:

1. Matthew says the priests bought the field ([Matthew 27:6–7](https://ref.ly/Matt27:6-Matt27:7)), but Acts suggests Judas bought it ([Acts 1:18](https://ref.ly/Acts1:18)).
2. Matthew says Judas hanged himself by hanging ([Matthew 27:5](https://ref.ly/Matt27:5)). Acts says he fell and his body burst open ([Acts 1:18](https://ref.ly/Acts1:18)).
3. Matthew says the field of blood was named for its use as a burial place ([Matthew 27:7–8](https://ref.ly/Matt27:7-Matt27:8)). Acts says it was named because of Judas’s violent death ([Acts 1:19](https://ref.ly/Acts1:19)).

The stories can align if Acts describes the results of Matthew's events.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 27:3–MAT 27:10

## Matthew 27:4 (id: 22115)

*innocent blood:* The innocence of Jesusis a key theme in the story of his suffering (see [Matthew 23:35](https://ref.ly/Matt23:35); [26:55–56](https://ref.ly/Matt26:55-Matt26:56), [59–60](https://ref.ly/Matt26:59-Matt26:60); [27:18–19](https://ref.ly/Matt27:18-Matt27:19), [24](https://ref.ly/Matt27:24); see also [Luke 23:47](https://ref.ly/Luke23:47)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 27:4

## Matthew 27:5 (id: 22122)

*hanged himself:* Judas killed himself because he felt guilty but did not repent. His death also matched the Old Testament law about punishing a false witness (see [Deuteronomy 19:16–21](https://ref.ly/Deut19:16-Deut19:21)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 27:5

## Matthew 27:7 (id: 22124)

*foreigners:* These were non\-Jewish people who died in Jerusalem. If they could not find the owner of donated money, they used it for public charity. In this case, they used money considered ceremonially unclean to buy a ceremonially unclean place for people considered ceremonially unclean.

## Matthew 27:9–10 (id: 22126)

* *what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled**:* The quote is from [Zechariah 11:12–13](https://ref.ly/Zech11:12-Zech11:13). Matthew might have followed the Jewish tradition of naming books by the first book in the scroll. In this case, Jeremiah would be the first book in the scroll containing Zechariah. Or, Matthew might be referencing similar passages in Jeremiah ([Jeremiah 19:1–13](https://ref.ly/Jer19:1-Jer19:13); [18:2–6](https://ref.ly/Jer18:2-Jer18:6); [32:6–15](https://ref.ly/Jer32:6-Jer32:15)) along with [Zechariah 11:12–13](https://ref.ly/Zech11:12-Zech11:13).
* Matthew notices a strong similarity between Zechariah's actions and those of the leading priests. Both situations involve rejecting God's messenger, who was meant to be the king of God's people.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 27:9–MAT 27:10

## Matthew 27:11 (id: 22090)

*King of the Jews:* The Sanhedrin's first charge of blasphemy in [Matthew 26:65–66](https://ref.ly/Matt26:65-Matt26:66); [27:1](https://ref.ly/Matt27:1) did not cause concern for the Romans. The Romabs considered it to be a Jewish religious issue (see [Acts 25:18–20](https://ref.ly/Acts25:18-Acts25:20)). So, the Sanhedrin changed the charge to make Jesus seem like a political rebel to the Romans (see [Luke 23:2](https://ref.ly/Luke23:2)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 27:11

## Matthew 27:11–26 (id: 22089)

The Roman trial included an initial hearing before Pilatee ([Matthew 27:11–14](https://ref.ly/Matt27:11-Matt27:14)), then one before Herod Antipas ([Luke 23:6–16](https://ref.ly/Luke23:6-Luke23:16)), and a second hearing with Pilate ([Matthew 27:15–26](https://ref.ly/Matt27:15-Matt27:26)).

## Matthew 27:15 (id: 22091)

Pilate's behavior seems unusual. It was not normal for him to try to please his Jewish subjects. But Pilate's relationship with Caesar might have been unstable at this time (see study note on John 19:12; see Philo, *On the Embassy to Gaius* 159–161\). If so, this gesture might have been to maintain peace and avoid negative attention from Rome.

This word can also mean a robber or someone who led a revolt (see [Luke 23:19](https://ref.ly/Luke23:19)). To the zealots, Barabbas was considered a hero.

* *All the people* (see [21:43](https://ref.ly/Matt21:43)): This does not mean every living Jewish person. Instead, it refers to those who urged the condemnation of Jesus. They represented all of Israel who disbelieved Jesus. Their actions led to consequences for the entire nation, like the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70\.
* *His blood be on us and on our children!* (see [23:35](https://ref.ly/Matt23:35); [2 Samuel 1:16](https://ref.ly/2Sam1:16); [14:9](https://ref.ly/2Sam14:9); [Jeremiah 51:35](https://ref.ly/Jer51:35); [Acts 5:28](https://ref.ly/Acts5:28); [18:6](https://ref.ly/Acts18:6); [20:26](https://ref.ly/Acts20:26)): Some Christians have misunderstood and misused this verse as a basis for persecuting Jews.

* The *scarlet robe* was probably a soldier's cloak used to imitate royal clothing in order to mock Jesus.
* Weaving *a crown of thorns* was meant to mock Jesus as a king.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 27:28–MAT 27:29

## Matthew 27:32 (id: 22104)

Usually, the person to be crucified would carry their own cross. They only carried the crossbeam since the vertical pole was already at the crucifixion site. The Romans might have forced Simon to help because Jesus was weak from being whipped. Making Simon help could also have been a way to mock Jesus. They treated him like someone who deserved a servant, even though they led him to his death.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 27:32

## Matthew 27:32–44 (id: 22103)

The crowd mocked Jesus, but their words were still true. He is the Son of God, the King of Israel, and the Messiah.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 27:32–MAT 27:44

## Matthew 27:34 (id: 22105)

* They probably gave Jesus wine mixed with bitter gall to ridicule him (see [Psalm 69:21](https://ref.ly/Ps69:21)). It also was a sedative. Jesus probably refused it so he could fully experience suffering for our sins (see [Isaiah 53:10](https://ref.ly/Isa53:10)).
* *Gall* is another name sometimes given to wormwood. It is a very bitter substance made from the oil of the *Artemisia* plant, sometimes used as medicine in the ancient world (compare [Mark 15:23](https://ref.ly/Mark15:23)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 27:34

## Matthew 27:35 (id: 22106)

*they had crucified Him:* Crucifixion (being nailed to a cross) was not common among Jews. But it was a widespread Roman punishment for military and political offenders. This was especially true for slaves, rebels, and insurrectionists (rioters). The extreme cruelty and public display of crucifixion was a strong warning to society. 

The Romans would flog victims (beat them with whips). Then they would crucify the victims naked. This added to their humiliation. Most considered it the most painful death possible. It involved intense suffering, exposure to weather and insects, and suffocation. It often concluded with a final violent spear thrust to end life. 

Since the Law said that anyone hung on a tree was under God’s curse ([Deuteronomy 21:22–23](https://ref.ly/Deut21:22-Deut21:23)), crucifixion was especially offensive to the Jewish people. Yet in God’s plan, what humans saw as shameful became the very means of salvation. Earlier, Jesus had told his disciples to take up their cross and follow him ([Matthew 16:24](https://ref.ly/Matt16:24)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 27:35

## Matthew 27:37 (id: 22107)

The Romans would fasten the official crime to the cross above the head of the offender. They accused Jesus of political rebellion.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 27:37

## Matthew 27:38 (id: 22108)

Jesus was crucified between two convicted revolutionaries. This increased his shame and made him appear guilty by association (linked with rebels).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 27:38

## Matthew 27:40 (id: 22110)

*If You are the Son of God**:* This taunt reminds us of when the devil tempted Jesus at the start of his public ministry ([Matthew 4:1–11](https://ref.ly/Matt4:1-Matt4:11)). The devil tried to use the special status of Jesus to tempt him to avoid suffering (see also [16:21–23](https://ref.ly/Matt16:21-Matt16:23)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 27:40

## Matthew 27:45 (id: 22111)

*darkness:* This represents God's judgment. Or, it could more specifically refer to the coming of the day of the Lord (see [Amos 5:18](https://ref.ly/Amos5:18), [20](https://ref.ly/Amos5:20); [8:9–10](https://ref.ly/Amos8:9-Amos8:10); also [Jeremiah 4:27–28](https://ref.ly/Jer4:27-Jer4:28); [13:16](https://ref.ly/Jer13:16); [15:9](https://ref.ly/Jer15:9)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 27:45

## Matthew 27:46 (id: 22112)

* *Eli, Eli:* This cry means *My God, My God.* The sound of these words may have made some people think Jesus was calling for Elijah ([Matthew 27:47](https://ref.ly/Matt27:47)).
* *My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?:* Jesus was expressing the weight of judgment he bore for humanity’s sin.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 27:46

## Matthew 27:47 (id: 22113)

Many Jews believed Elijah would return before the day of the Lord ([Matthew 11:14–15](https://ref.ly/Matt11:14-Matt11:15); [17:10–13](https://ref.ly/Matt17:10-Matt17:13); [Malachi 4:5](https://ref.ly/Mal4:5)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 27:47

## Matthew 27:48 (id: 22114)

The *sour wine* was vinegar. The drink was probably meant to mock Jesus by pretending to ease his thirst (compare [Psalm 69:21](https://ref.ly/Ps69:21) with [Matthew 27:34](https://ref.ly/Matt27:34)). Although some scholars think they offered it as a genuine act of kindness.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 27:48

## Matthew 27:50 (id: 22116)

* Each of the four gospels focuses on different parts of the final moments of Jesus.
* *He yielded up His spirit:* Jesus gave up his life willingly. This shows his authority, since he chose the moment of his own death (see also [John 19:30](https://ref.ly/John19:30)).
* *Jesus had cried out again* (see [Matthew 27:46](https://ref.ly/Matt27:46)): This final loud cry was the last prayer of Jesus (see [Luke 23:46](https://ref.ly/Luke23:46)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 27:50

## Matthew 27:51 (id: 22117)

* The tearing of the temple curtain is symbolic. It means that that the wall dividing people from God has been torn down by the death of Jesus (see also [Ephesians 2:11–22](https://ref.ly/Eph2:11-Eph2:22); [Hebrews 6:19](https://ref.ly/Heb6:19); [9:1–10:25](https://ref.ly/Heb9:1-Heb10:25)).
* *The earth quaked and the rocks were split:* These are signs that judgment has come (see [Exodus 19:18](https://ref.ly/Exod19:18); [Judges 5:4](https://ref.ly/Judg5:4); [Psalm 18:7](https://ref.ly/Ps18:7); [Joel 3:14–17](https://ref.ly/Joel3:14-Joel3:17); [Amos 8:8–10](https://ref.ly/Amos8:8-Amos8:10)). The Jewish historian Josephus records that around AD 30, a star resembling a sword appeared and the temple gates opened by themselves (Josephus, *War* 6\.5\.3–4\).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 27:51

## Matthew 27:52–53 (id: 22118)

* *The tombs broke open:* At the moment of the death of Jesus, God’s kingdom broke into the world in a new way. His death destroyed the power of death and began the promise of final resurrection (see [Isaiah 26:19](https://ref.ly/Isa26:19); [Daniel 12:2](https://ref.ly/Dan12:2); [1 Corinthians 15:1–58](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:1-1Cor15:58); [Colossians 1:18](https://ref.ly/Col1:18); [Hebrews 2:14–15](https://ref.ly/Heb2:14-Heb2:15)).
* Some holy people were raised to life. But they may not have entered Jerusalem until after Jesus rose from the dead. Another view is that they were not raised until after Jesus’s resurrection, since Jesus is the “firstfruits” (the first to be raised, showing what will come for others; see [1 Corinthians 15:20](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:20), [23](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:23); [Colossians 1:18](https://ref.ly/Col1:18)). If this second view is correct, Matthew included the story to show the great impact of the death of Jesus.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 27:52–MAT 27:53

## Matthew 27:54 (id: 22119)

* The Roman officer and the other soldiers were not Jewish.
* *the Son of God:* This could be a clear statement that Jesus is the unique Son of God (see [Matthew 14:33](https://ref.ly/Matt14:33); [16:16](https://ref.ly/Matt16:16)) or perhaps a general statement about the innocence of Jesus (see [Luke 23:47](https://ref.ly/Luke23:47)). They reacted to the earthquake and everything that happened as signs of divine involvement in this event.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 27:54

## Matthew 27:58 (id: 22120)

* In Roman crucifixion, the bodies of criminals were often left on the cross until they rotted. Jewish law, however, did not allow this. [Deuteronomy 21:22–23](https://ref.ly/Deut21:22-Deut21:23) forbids leaving a body on a cross or gallows overnight. Joseph of Arimathea acted in line with this law when he asked for the body of Jesus. His request also showed his loyalty to Jesus.
* *Pilate ordered:* Pilate agreed to Joseph’s request and gave the order. He likely did this because he did not believe Jesus was guilty of rebellion against Rome (see [Matthew 27:24–26](https://ref.ly/Matt27:24-Matt27:26)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 27:58

## Matthew 27:59–60 (id: 22121)

* Burial customs were important in Judaism, unlike the Greeks and Romans who cremated their dead. Jews considered leaving a body unburied to be a severe punishment ([Deuteronomy 21:22–23](https://ref.ly/Deut21:22-Deut21:23); [2 Kings 9:37](https://ref.ly/2Kgs9:37); [Psalm 79:3](https://ref.ly/Ps79:3); [Jeremiah 16:4](https://ref.ly/Jer16:4), [6](https://ref.ly/Jer16:6); [Ezekiel 29:5](https://ref.ly/Ezek29:5); [Revelation 11:9](https://ref.ly/Rev11:9)).

    People mourned and lamented death ([Mark 5:38–39](https://ref.ly/Mark5:38-Mark5:39)). They washed the body ([Acts 9:37](https://ref.ly/Acts9:37)). They anointed the body ([Matt 26:6–13](https://ref.ly/Matt26:6-Matt26:13); [John 12:3](https://ref.ly/John12:3), [7](https://ref.ly/John12:7); [19:39](https://ref.ly/John19:39)). And they wrapped the body in burial cloths ([Matthew 27:59](https://ref.ly/Matt27:59); see [Genesis 50:2–3](https://ref.ly/Gen50:2-Gen50:3)). Then they placed the body in a tomb ([Matthew 23:27](https://ref.ly/Matt23:27)). This tomb was either tunneled into rock or carved into a cave wall. A large stone often sealed the tomb to prevent ceremonial uncleanness or stealing.

* *clean linen … new tomb:* These terms symbolize ceremonial purity. Joseph of Arimathea bought the tomb for his family, but had not used it.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 27:59–MAT 27:60

## Matthew 27:62–66 (id: 22123)

This event supports the truth of Jesus resurrection. It is very unlikely that Matthew invented the story, because many witnesses were alive who could have denied it.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 27:62–MAT 27:66

## Matthew 28:1 (id: 22134)

*Mary Magdalene* (see [Matthew 27:56](https://ref.ly/Matt27:56)): Mentioning two women as witnesses adds credibility to the story. In those times, people considered the testimony of a woman less reliable than a man. So a someone making up a false story would not have chosen women as witnesses.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 28:1

## Matthew 28:1–10 (id: 22127)

The four gospels each emphasize different aspects of the empty tomb and resurrection appearances. Matthew focuses on three things: 

1. the reunion of Jesus and his disciples in Galilee,
2. the Jewish leaders' attempt to discredit the resurrection, and
3. the importance of the ressurection for the salvation of the world.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 28:1–MAT 28:10

## Matthew 28:12 (id: 22128)

* Such a bribe was against the law (see [Exodus 20:16](https://ref.ly/Exod20:16); [23:8](https://ref.ly/Exod23:8)).
* *elders:* See the study note on Matthew 21:23.

## Matthew 28:13 (id: 22129)

*stole him away:* Stealing from tombs was common in ancient times. So this accusation would have been easy to believe.

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 28:13

## Matthew 28:15 (id: 22130)

*And this account has been circulated among the Jews to this very day:* Around AD 165, the early church father Justin Martyr wrote to the Jews of his time. He wrote, “You have sent . . . men throughout all the world to proclaim, ‘A godless and lawless heresy has sprung from one Jesus, a Galilean deceiver, whom we crucified, but his disciples stole him by night from the tomb . . . and now \[the disciples] deceive men by asserting that he has risen from the dead and ascended into heaven’” (Justin Martyr, *Dialogue with Trypho* 108\). 

This false information probably increased after the disciples began preaching about the resurrection of Jesus (see [Acts 2:22–36](https://ref.ly/Acts2:22-Acts2:36)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 28:15

## Matthew 28:17 (id: 22131)

*some doubted:* This could refer to Thomas ([John 20:24–29](https://ref.ly/John20:24-John20:29)). But all eleven disciples might have experienced mixed feelings of worship and doubt (see also [Matt 14:31](https://ref.ly/Matt14:31); [Luke 24:10–11](https://ref.ly/Luke24:10-Luke24:11); [John 20:24–29](https://ref.ly/John20:24-John20:29)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 28:17

## Matthew 28:18 (id: 22132)

The authority of Jesus comes from the power given to him by the Father (see [Matthew 7:29](https://ref.ly/Matt7:29); [9:6–8](https://ref.ly/Matt9:6-Matt9:8); [21:23–27](https://ref.ly/Matt21:23-Matt21:27); [26:64](https://ref.ly/Matt26:64); [John 3:35](https://ref.ly/John3:35)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 28:18

## Matthew 28:19 (id: 22133)

* *go and* (literally *going*)*:* This is a command to make disciples. Matthew likely meant "go" as a separate command, not just as "while you go"(compare similar uses in [Matthew 9:6](https://ref.ly/Matt9:6); [Acts 10:20](https://ref.ly/Acts10:20)).
* *make disciples*: A *disciple* turns from sin, trusts Jesus for salvation, and obeys his teachings.
* *all nations:* The gospel mission to non\-Jewish (gentile) people officially started here (see [Matthew 10:5–6](https://ref.ly/Matt10:5-Matt10:6); [15:24](https://ref.ly/Matt15:24); also [1:1](https://ref.ly/Matt1:1); [2:1–12](https://ref.ly/Matt2:1-Matt2:12); [8:5–13](https://ref.ly/Matt8:5-Matt8:13); [21:43](https://ref.ly/Matt21:43); [24:14](https://ref.ly/Matt24:14); [26:13](https://ref.ly/Matt26:13)).
* Two parts of making disciples are baptizing and teaching ([Matthew 28:20](https://ref.ly/Matt28:20)). Baptism is a public identification with Jesus and submission to him and his work of salvation (see [3:13–17](https://ref.ly/Matt3:13-Matt3:17); [10:32–33](https://ref.ly/Matt10:32-Matt10:33); [20:28](https://ref.ly/Matt20:28); [26:28](https://ref.ly/Matt26:28); [Acts 2:38](https://ref.ly/Acts2:38); [Romans 6:1–11](https://ref.ly/Rom6:1-Rom6:11); [1 Peter 3:21](https://ref.ly/1Pet3:21)).
* *in the name of:* This means entering a relationship and its benefits for true believers in Christ.
* *Father … Son … Holy Spirit:* This phrase shows the Christian belief that the one God is three persons (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) known as the Trinity (see also [1 Corinthians 12:4–6](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:4-1Cor12:6); [2 Corinthians 13:14](https://ref.ly/2Cor13:14); [Ephesians 4:4–6](https://ref.ly/Eph4:4-Eph4:6); [2 Thessalonians 2:13–14](https://ref.ly/2Thess2:13-2Thess2:14); [1 Peter 1:2](https://ref.ly/1Pet1:2); [Revelation 1:4–6](https://ref.ly/Rev1:4-Rev1:6)).

* **Associated Passages:** MAT 28:19

## Matthew 28:20 (id: 22135)

*teaching:* The disciples are to teach people everything Jesus commanded, such as the Sermon on the Mount (chapters [5–7](https://ref.ly/Matt5:1-Matt7:29)). People should recognize the church because it obeys the commands of Jesus ([5:17–20](https://ref.ly/Matt5:17-Matt5:20); [7:13–27](https://ref.ly/Matt7:13-Matt7:27)). The authority and presence of Jesus establish the mission of the disciples (see also [1:23](https://ref.ly/Matt1:23); [18:20](https://ref.ly/Matt18:20)).
