## 1 Thessalonians 1:1 (id: 17213)

Ancient letters began with the name of the author, the name of the recipients, and a salutation. • Paul, Silas, and Timothy were the founders of this church ([Acts 17:1–9](https://ref.ly/Acts17:1-Acts17:9)). • The greeting grace and peace summarizes the believer’s experience of the Good News.

* **Associated Passages:** 1TH 1:1

## 1 Thessalonians 1:2 (id: 17215)

*We always thank God for all of you*: This is the first of three times the apostle Paul gives thanks for the church (see [2:13](https://ref.ly/1Thess2:13); [3:9](https://ref.ly/1Thess3:9)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1TH 1:2

## 1 Thessalonians 1:2–10 (id: 17214)

After thanking God for the faith, love, and hope of the Thessalonian believers ([1:2–3](https://ref.ly/1Thess1:2-1Thess1:3)), Paul recalls how the Good News was proclaimed to them ([1:4–5](https://ref.ly/1Thess1:4-1Thess1:5)) and how they accepted its message ([1:6–10](https://ref.ly/1Thess1:6-1Thess1:10)). Paul returns to these themes in [2:1–12](https://ref.ly/1Thess2:1-1Thess2:12) and [2:13–16](https://ref.ly/1Thess2:13-1Thess2:16).

* **Associated Passages:** 1TH 1:2–1TH 1:10

## 1 Thessalonians 1:3 (id: 17216)

The reason for Paul’s gratitude was the Thessalonians’ faithful work*,* loving deeds*,* and enduring hope (or *confidence;* see [3:6](https://ref.ly/1Thess3:6); [5:8](https://ref.ly/1Thess5:8); [2 Thes 1:3–4](https://ref.ly/2Thess1:3-2Thess1:4)).

God called the Thessalonians through the proclamation of the Good News ([2 Thes 2:13–14](https://ref.ly/2Thess2:13-2Thess2:14)). The Holy Spirit convinced the hearers that the message was true ([1 Cor 2:4–5](https://ref.ly/1Cor2:4-1Cor2:5); [1 Pet 1:12](https://ref.ly/1Pet1:12)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1TH 1:5

## 1 Thessalonians 1:6 (id: 17219)

Because they accepted the Good News, the Thessalonians experienced severe suffering from their contemporaries ([2:14](https://ref.ly/1Thess2:14); [3:3–4](https://ref.ly/1Thess3:3-1Thess3:4)). Yet as they followed the model of the apostles and of the Lord himself ([Matt 5:11–12](https://ref.ly/Matt5:11-Matt5:12); [Rom 8:17](https://ref.ly/Rom8:17); [12:12](https://ref.ly/Rom12:12); [Phil 2:17](https://ref.ly/Phil2:17)), they received joy from the Holy Spirit ([1 Pet 4:13–14](https://ref.ly/1Pet4:13-1Pet4:14)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1TH 1:6

## 1 Thessalonians 1:7–8 (id: 17220)

* **Associated Passages:** 1TH 1:7–1TH 1:8

## 1 Thessalonians 1:9 (id: 17221)

Among the Gentiles, the message of the apostles was an exhortation to turn from false idols to serve the living and true God*,* who created all things ([Acts 14:11–18](https://ref.ly/Acts14:11-Acts14:18); [17:22–31](https://ref.ly/Acts17:22-Acts17:31); [19:23–41](https://ref.ly/Acts19:23-Acts19:41)). In a pluralistic religious environment, the call to forsake ancestral gods was unusual (cp. [Jer 10:8–10](https://ref.ly/Jer10:8-Jer10:10); [1 Cor 8:4–6](https://ref.ly/1Cor8:4-1Cor8:6)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1TH 1:9

## 1 Thessalonians 1:10 (id: 17212)

The resurrection of Jesus from the dead was the core of the apostles’ preaching ([4:14](https://ref.ly/1Thess4:14); [Acts 2:32](https://ref.ly/Acts2:32); [3:15](https://ref.ly/Acts3:15); [10:40](https://ref.ly/Acts10:40); [13:29–30](https://ref.ly/Acts13:29-Acts13:30); [1 Cor 15:3–8](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:3-1Cor15:8)) and the foundation for confidence in Jesus’ return (see [1 Thes 5:9](https://ref.ly/1Thess5:9); [2 Thes 1:6–10](https://ref.ly/2Thess1:6-2Thess1:10)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1TH 1:10

## 1 Thessalonians 2:1 (id: 17233)

The Greek word translated visit often refers to entry into a city. Ancient orators were known for their grand entrances into a town. Paul’s entrance to Thessalonica should be judged by its credible results rather than its lack of pomp or ceremony.

* **Associated Passages:** 1TH 2:1

## 1 Thessalonians 2:1–3.13 (id: 17222)

The body of this letter begins by discussing Paul’s and his associates’ character ([2:1–12](https://ref.ly/1Thess2:1-1Thess2:12)) and the way the Thessalonians received the Good News ([2:13–16](https://ref.ly/1Thess2:13-1Thess2:16)). It then emphasizes Paul’s sincere care for the church, telling of his attempts to return to visit them ([2:17–20](https://ref.ly/1Thess2:17-1Thess2:20)) and his decision to send Timothy to them when he himself could not come ([3:1–5](https://ref.ly/1Thess3:1-1Thess3:5)). Finally, it tells of Paul’s joy over Timothy’s good report ([3:6–9](https://ref.ly/1Thess3:6-1Thess3:9)) and his prayers to get back to the church himself ([3:10–13](https://ref.ly/1Thess3:10-1Thess3:13)). This lengthy defense is Paul’s response to criticisms of his abrupt departure and prolonged absence.

* **Associated Passages:** 1TH 2:1–1TH 3:13

## 1 Thessalonians 2:2 (id: 17235)

Despite the dishonor and pain Paul and Silas had suffered in Philippi ([Acts 16:19–40](https://ref.ly/Acts16:19-Acts16:40)), they showed courage by preaching confidently in Thessalonica.

* **Associated Passages:** 1TH 2:2

## 1 Thessalonians 2:4 (id: 17236)

In the ancient world, those entrusted with a public office had to be tested and approved. The Thessalonians ([2:3](https://ref.ly/1Thess2:3)) and God served as two witnesses to the purity of Paul’s motives.

* **Associated Passages:** 1TH 2:4

## 1 Thessalonians 2:5 (id: 17237)

Flattery was a common means of getting financial gain from others. Paul denies that he flattered the Thessalonians in order to be given money. He again calls both the Thessalonians and God as witnesses (cp. [2:10](https://ref.ly/1Thess2:10); [Deut 19:15](https://ref.ly/Deut19:15); [2 Cor 13:1](https://ref.ly/2Cor13:1); [1 Tim 5:19](https://ref.ly/1Tim5:19)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1TH 2:5

## 1 Thessalonians 2:7 (id: 17238)

we were like children: Some manuscripts read *we were gentle.* Paul and his associates did not wield their apostolic authority to make demands (cp. [Matt 20:25–28](https://ref.ly/Matt20:25-Matt20:28)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1TH 2:7

## 1 Thessalonians 2:9 (id: 17239)

Paul and his associates engaged in manual labor to support themselves while in the city (cp. [Acts 18:1–4](https://ref.ly/Acts18:1-Acts18:4); [1 Cor 9:12–18](https://ref.ly/1Cor9:12-1Cor9:18)) as an example to the Thessalonians ([2 Thes 3:8–9](https://ref.ly/2Thess3:8-2Thess3:9)) and to avoid becoming an economic burden to them.

* **Associated Passages:** 1TH 2:9

## 1 Thessalonians 2:10 (id: 17223)

Both God and the Thessalonians were witnesses (see [2:5](https://ref.ly/1Thess2:5)) that Paul’s conduct was devout and honest*,* terms used in ancient literature to describe obedience to both divine and human laws.

* **Associated Passages:** 1TH 2:10

## 1 Thessalonians 2:11 (id: 17224)

In the ancient world, the moral instruction of children was a fundamental obligation of fathers. Roman fathers could be harsh, but Plutarch advised Greek fathers to use praise, reason, exhortations, and good counsel when teaching children to avoid vice and embrace virtue. Paul describes himself as this kind of father to the Thessalonians.

* **Associated Passages:** 1TH 2:11

## 1 Thessalonians 2:12 (id: 17225)

What God would consider worthy is a life lived in harmony with the high standards he expects of those called ([4:7](https://ref.ly/1Thess4:7)) to share his Kingdom and glory ([Rom 8:17–18](https://ref.ly/Rom8:17-Rom8:18); [Col 1:27](https://ref.ly/Col1:27); [2 Thes 2:14](https://ref.ly/2Thess2:14)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1TH 2:12

## 1 Thessalonians 2:13 (id: 17226)

Paul gives thanks a second time (see [1:2](https://ref.ly/1Thess1:2); [3:9](https://ref.ly/1Thess3:9)) because the Thessalonians accepted the message of the apostles—not just as a human philosophy, but as the very word of God ([1:5](https://ref.ly/1Thess1:5); [2 Thes 2:14](https://ref.ly/2Thess2:14); [2 Cor 5:20](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:20)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1TH 2:13

## 1 Thessalonians 2:14 (id: 17227)

The evidence that the Thessalonian believers accepted the word of God was that they suffered persecution ([1:6](https://ref.ly/1Thess1:6)). This followed the pattern of the apostles, the churches in Judea ([Acts 8:1](https://ref.ly/Acts8:1)), and Christ himself.

* **Associated Passages:** 1TH 2:14

## 1 Thessalonians 2:15 (id: 17228)

Paul was not anti\-Jewish; out of love for his own people, he prayed for their salvation ([Rom 9:1–5](https://ref.ly/Rom9:1-Rom9:5); [10:1](https://ref.ly/Rom10:1)). But he was aware of the role some of the Jews had in the deaths of God’s messengers, including Jesus ([1 Kgs 19:10](https://ref.ly/1Kgs19:10); [Acts 7:52](https://ref.ly/Acts7:52)). Now they had persecuted the apostolic messengers in Thessalonica ([Acts 17:10](https://ref.ly/Acts17:10); [2 Cor 11:26](https://ref.ly/2Cor11:26)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1TH 2:15

## 1 Thessalonians 2:16 (id: 17229)

The mission to the Gentiles was one of the most important issues in the early church ([Acts 11:18](https://ref.ly/Acts11:18); [13:46–49](https://ref.ly/Acts13:46-Acts13:49); [28:28](https://ref.ly/Acts28:28); [Rom 1:16](https://ref.ly/Rom1:16)). • Judgment comes when sins pile up to their complete measure ([Gen 15:16](https://ref.ly/Gen15:16); [Dan 8:23](https://ref.ly/Dan8:23); cp. [Matt 23:31–36](https://ref.ly/Matt23:31-Matt23:36)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1TH 2:16

## 1 Thessalonians 2:17 (id: 17230)

separated: Paul describes his unplanned departure from Thessalonica (see [Acts 17:10](https://ref.ly/Acts17:10)) as depriving these new believers of their spiritual parents. However, this absence was not neglect. As evidenced by Paul’s attempts to return to the church, the separation was unintentional (cp. [Phil 1:7](https://ref.ly/Phil1:7); [Col 2:5](https://ref.ly/Col2:5)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1TH 2:17

## 1 Thessalonians 2:18 (id: 17231)

again and again: Paul made repeated attempts to return to the Thessalonian church. Despite the opposition of Satan (see [Rom 16:20](https://ref.ly/Rom16:20); [2 Cor 2:11](https://ref.ly/2Cor2:11); [Eph 6:10–12](https://ref.ly/Eph6:10-Eph6:12)), both Timothy ([1 Thes 3:2](https://ref.ly/1Thess3:2), [5](https://ref.ly/1Thess3:5)) and Paul ([Acts 20:1–3](https://ref.ly/Acts20:1-Acts20:3)) were eventually able to visit the church again.

* **Associated Passages:** 1TH 2:18

## 1 Thessalonians 2:19 (id: 17232)

In the Greek and Roman world, a crown was given to those who received great civic honor or who were victorious in athletic games.

* **Associated Passages:** 1TH 2:19

## 1 Thessalonians 2:20 (id: 17234)

Paul views the Thessalonian believers—not his own accomplishments—as the source of his pride*,* or renown, and his joy ([3:9](https://ref.ly/1Thess3:9)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1TH 2:20

## 1 Thessalonians 3:1–5 (id: 17240)

After preaching in Berea, Paul had departed from Macedonia and sailed to Athens, instructing Silas and Timothy to join him soon ([Acts 17:13–15](https://ref.ly/Acts17:13-Acts17:15)). Timothy returned to Thessalonica ([1 Thes 3:2](https://ref.ly/1Thess3:2)), as Paul’s anxiety for the Thessalonian church had intensified ([3:1](https://ref.ly/1Thess3:1), [5](https://ref.ly/1Thess3:5)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1TH 3:1–1TH 3:5

## 1 Thessalonians 3:3 (id: 17244)

Paul was concerned that Satan, the tempter ([Mark 1:13](https://ref.ly/Mark1:13); [1 Cor 7:5](https://ref.ly/1Cor7:5)), had undermined the Thessalonians’ faith ([1 Thes 3:2](https://ref.ly/1Thess3:2), [6](https://ref.ly/1Thess3:6), [8](https://ref.ly/1Thess3:8)) and rendered his work among them futile ([Gal 2:2](https://ref.ly/Gal2:2); [Phil 2:16](https://ref.ly/Phil2:16)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1TH 3:5

## 1 Thessalonians 3:6 (id: 17246)

Paul wrote 1 Thessalonians from Corinth just after Timothy returned from Thessalonica ([3:2](https://ref.ly/1Thess3:2), [5](https://ref.ly/1Thess3:5); [Acts 18:5](https://ref.ly/Acts18:5)). Timothy’s report provided good news about the Thessalonians’ faith and love*,* steadfastness ([1 Thes 3:8](https://ref.ly/1Thess3:8)), and hope (see also [5:8](https://ref.ly/1Thess5:8); [2 Thes 1:3–4](https://ref.ly/2Thess1:3-2Thess1:4)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1TH 3:6

He was relieved to learn that the Thessalonians remained strong and were standing firm in the Lord even though they were also suffering ([2:14](https://ref.ly/1Thess2:14); [3:3–4](https://ref.ly/1Thess3:3-1Thess3:4)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1TH 3:8

## 1 Thessalonians 3:11 (id: 17241)

Paul’s prayer to return to Thessalonica very soon ([3:10](https://ref.ly/1Thess3:10)) is directed both to the Father and the Lord Jesus*,* implying Jesus’ divinity.

* **Associated Passages:** 1TH 3:11

## 1 Thessalonians 3:12 (id: 17242)

A characteristic of this church was their love for one another as members of God’s family ([4:9](https://ref.ly/1Thess4:9); [2 Thes 1:3–4](https://ref.ly/2Thess1:3-2Thess1:4)). Paul prays that their love will grow and overflow toward those outside the Christian community (cp. [1 Thes 5:15](https://ref.ly/1Thess5:15); [Gal 6:10](https://ref.ly/Gal6:10); [2 Tim 2:24](https://ref.ly/2Tim2:24); [Titus 3:2](https://ref.ly/Titus3:2)) even in the face of persecution.

## 1 Thessalonians 4:1–2 (id: 17248)

we urge you: Paul’s exhortation in the name of the Lord Jesus emphasizes the authority of his teaching. • you remember what we taught: Ancient letters frequently included reminders of what the recipients already knew. Paul reminds the Thessalonians of matters that required their obedience ([4:11](https://ref.ly/1Thess4:11); [2 Thes 3:4](https://ref.ly/2Thess3:4), [6](https://ref.ly/2Thess3:6), [10](https://ref.ly/2Thess3:10), [12](https://ref.ly/2Thess3:12)).

Paul takes up a variety of exhortations on topics such as leadership and community relations ([5:12–15](https://ref.ly/1Thess5:12-1Thess5:15)), relationship with the Lord ([5:16–18](https://ref.ly/1Thess5:16-1Thess5:18)), and prophecy ([5:19–22](https://ref.ly/1Thess5:19-1Thess5:22)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1TH 4:1–1TH 5:22

## 1 Thessalonians 4:3 (id: 17259)

God’s will is for you to be holy: The foundation of Christian ethics is not philosophical speculation about virtue but doing God’s will ([Rom 12:1–2](https://ref.ly/Rom12:1-Rom12:2); [Eph 6:6](https://ref.ly/Eph6:6); [Heb 10:36](https://ref.ly/Heb10:36); [13:20–21](https://ref.ly/Heb13:20-Heb13:21)).

Prostitution was allowed, but sexual relations with another man’s wife were prohibited. Roman marriage customs barred women, but not men, from extramarital affairs. By contrast, Jewish and Christian authors alike prohibited all sexual involvement outside of marriage ([Acts 15:20](https://ref.ly/Acts15:20); [1 Cor 6:12–20](https://ref.ly/1Cor6:12-1Cor6:20); [Col 3:5–6](https://ref.ly/Col3:5-Col3:6)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1TH 4:7

Self\-sufficiency and decorum would win the recognition and respect of people who are not believers (see [Rom 13:13](https://ref.ly/Rom13:13); [1 Cor 5:12–13](https://ref.ly/1Cor5:12-1Cor5:13); [Col 4:5](https://ref.ly/Col4:5)).

the believers who have died (literally *those who have fallen asleep;* also in [4:14](https://ref.ly/1Thess4:14)): Sleep was a common euphemism for death in Greek, Jewish, and Christian literature ([Dan 12:2](https://ref.ly/Dan12:2); [Matt 27:52](https://ref.ly/Matt27:52)). Personal existence continues after death ([Luke 23:40–43](https://ref.ly/Luke23:40-Luke23:43); [Acts 7:55–60](https://ref.ly/Acts7:55-Acts7:60); [2 Cor 5:6–10](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:6-2Cor5:10); [Phil 1:20–24](https://ref.ly/Phil1:20-Phil1:24); [Rev 6:9–11](https://ref.ly/Rev6:9-Rev6:11)); those who have died await the resurrection ([1 Cor 15:23](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:23)). • grieve like people who have no hope: Ancient letters of comfort exhorted mourners not to be overcome with grief because they could do nothing to avert death. Paul does not prohibit grief (cp. [John 16:6](https://ref.ly/John16:6), [20](https://ref.ly/John16:20); [Phil 2:27](https://ref.ly/Phil2:27)) but calls Christian mourners to abandon the kind of grief typical of those who have no hope in God.

The central Christian creed, that Jesus died and was raised to life again*,* is the foundation for hope in the face of death, guaranteed by the resurrection of Christ ([1 Cor 15](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:1-1Cor15:58)). • God will bring back refers to the resurrection of believers ([1 Thes 4:16](https://ref.ly/1Thess4:16)).

In the future it will announce the gathering of God’s chosen people from the “farthest ends of the earth and heaven” ([Matt 24:31](https://ref.ly/Matt24:31); cp.

For you know quite well: Paul reminds them of the teaching they had already received ([3:3–4](https://ref.ly/1Thess3:3-1Thess3:4)). • The day of the Lord’s return is the time when God will come to judge humanity ([Isa 13:6](https://ref.ly/Isa13:6), [9](https://ref.ly/Isa13:9); [Ezek 30:3](https://ref.ly/Ezek30:3)) and save his people ([Joel 2:21–32](https://ref.ly/Joel2:21-Joel2:32); [3:18](https://ref.ly/Joel3:18); [Zech 14](https://ref.ly/Zech14:1-Zech14:21)). • like a thief in the night: Cp.

[2 Thes 1:6–10](https://ref.ly/2Thess1:6-2Thess1:10); [2:8](https://ref.ly/2Thess2:8)) represents the carrying out of his judgment against evil. However, God destined believers for salvation, not wrath ([2 Thes 2:13–14](https://ref.ly/2Thess2:13-2Thess2:14)), and they will escape the terrors of the day of the Lord ([1 Thes 5:1–3](https://ref.ly/1Thess5:1-1Thess5:3)).

honor (or *know*): This may be a call either to honor church leaders or to recognize the emerging leaders in the church ([1 Cor 16:15–16](https://ref.ly/1Cor16:15-1Cor16:16)). True leaders . . . work hard ([1 Tim 4:10](https://ref.ly/1Tim4:10); [5:17](https://ref.ly/1Tim5:17)) and govern to serve ([Matt 20:25–28](https://ref.ly/Matt20:25-Matt20:28)).

Leaders were to receive honor and love not because of their high position but because of their work. • live peacefully: Teaching about community peace and harmony was a standard topic in ancient moral instruction. Harmony between believers and leaders was especially important because of the persecution the church suffered ([2:14](https://ref.ly/1Thess2:14)).

The responsibility for the moral progress of the congregation does not rest solely with the leaders ([4:18](https://ref.ly/1Thess4:18); [5:11](https://ref.ly/1Thess5:11)). Paul urged the church to warn those who are lazy*,* that is, those who were “disorderly,” and who did not live by the apostles’ instructions (see [2 Thes 3:6–15](https://ref.ly/2Thess3:6-2Thess3:15)). • Take tender care of those who are weak*,* or those who have no economic or social power. Greek society denigrated the weak. • Instead of being irritable, believers should be patient in their relationships ([Gal 5:23](https://ref.ly/Gal5:23); [Eph 4:2](https://ref.ly/Eph4:2)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1TH 5:14

Jesus and the apostles warned against retaliation ([Matt 5:38–48](https://ref.ly/Matt5:38-Matt5:48); [Luke 6:27–36](https://ref.ly/Luke6:27-Luke6:36); [Rom 12:17–21](https://ref.ly/Rom12:17-Rom12:21); [1 Pet 3:9](https://ref.ly/1Pet3:9)). The Roman author Seneca, by contrast, considered revenge legitimate and necessary as a way of restoring social honor lost because of ill treatment from others. Paul calls Christians to do good—both to members of the church (each other) and to those outside the Christian community (to all people), including their persecutors ([1 Thes 2:14](https://ref.ly/1Thess2:14); see [3:12](https://ref.ly/1Thess3:12); [Gal 6:10](https://ref.ly/Gal6:10)).

## 1 Thessalonians 5:20–21 (id: 17276)

Prophecy, meant to build up the church ([1 Cor 14:1–4](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:1-1Cor14:4)), should not be rejected. Instead, the Thessalonians should test the prophecies ([1 Cor 12:10](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:10); [14:29](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:29)) to discern their origin, to check their agreement with the teaching of the apostles ([2 Thes 2:2](https://ref.ly/2Thess2:2); [1 Jn 4:1–3](https://ref.ly/1John4:1-1John4:3)), and to gauge the character of those who utter them ([Matt 7:15–20](https://ref.ly/Matt7:15-Matt7:20)). Early Christian teaching said, “Not everyone who speaks about spiritual things is a prophet, but only if the person’s conduct is like the Lord” (*Didache*11:8\). They should hold on to what is good—namely, prophecies that have been tested and found to be genuine.
