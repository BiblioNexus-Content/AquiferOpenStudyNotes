--------------------------------

## 1 Samuel 1:1 (id: 16774)

* Elkanah was a Levite (a member of the tribe of Levi) ([1 Chronicles 6:22–27](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:22-1Chr6:27)). After the Israelites conquered the promised land, the Levites received towns in other tribes' territories, including Ephraim ([Joshua 21:20](https://ref.ly/Josh21:20)).
* Elkanah's hometown was Ramah ([1 Samuel 2:11](https://ref.ly/1Sam2:11)). Do not confuse this Ramah with the one in the land of Benjamin (see [Joshua 18:25](https://ref.ly/Josh18:25); [Judges 19:13](https://ref.ly/Judg19:13); [Matthew 2:18](https://ref.ly/Matt2:18)).
* The region of Zuph got its name from one of Elkanah's ancestors, a Levite from the Kohath clan ([1 Chronicles 6:35](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:35)). Saul first met Samuel in Zuph while looking for his father's donkeys ([1 Samuel 9:5](https://ref.ly/1Sam9:5)).
* Elkanah's long family history suggests he was important in society.

* **Associated Passages:** 1SA 1:1

## 1 Samuel 1:2 (id: 16777)

In the Bible, when a man married two wives at the same time, it often led to serious conflict ([1 Samuel 1:6–7](https://ref.ly/1Sam1:6-1Sam1:7); [Genesis 16](https://ref.ly/Gen16:1-Gen16:16); [21](https://ref.ly/Gen21:1-Gen21:34); [29](https://ref.ly/Gen29:1-Gen29:35)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1SA 1:2

## 1 Samuel 1:3 (id: 16778)

* Elkanah made this trip every year because the law required people to attend three festivals a year ([Exodus 23:14–17](https://ref.ly/Exod23:14-Exod23:17)).
* According to God's law, Israelites had to sacrifice at God's chosen sanctuary ([Deuteronomy 12:1–28](https://ref.ly/Deut12:1-Deut12:28)). From the time of Joshua to Samuel, God's sanctuary, the tabernacle, was in Shiloh ([Joshua 18:1](https://ref.ly/Josh18:1)). Shiloh was a town in Ephraim about 13\.7 kilometers (8\.5 miles) north of Bethel on the way to Shechem. King David later moved the tabernacle to Jerusalem ([2 Samuel 6](https://ref.ly/2Sam6:1-2Sam6:23)).
* *the LORD of Hosts*: In the Hebrew Old Testament, God is often called *Yahweh Tseba’oth* or *’Elohim Tseba’oth*. These titles are traditionally translated as “Lord of hosts” and “God of hosts.”

    The term “hosts” (Hebrew *tseba’oth*, traditionally “sabaoth”) usually means “armies.” It can refer to human armies, like the armies of Israel (for example, [1 Samuel 17:45](https://ref.ly/1Sam17:45)). I can also refer to foreign armies sent to carry out the Lord’s plans (for example, [Isaiah 9:11–13](https://ref.ly/Isa9:11-Isa9:13)). However, it most often refers to God's armies of angels sent from heaven to carry out his commands and fight on earth (for example, [2 Kings 6:17](https://ref.ly/2Kgs6:17)).

    This title highlights God's role as a powerful warrior in the story involving the ark of the covenant and the Philistines ([1 Samuel 4–6](https://ref.ly/1Sam4:1-1Sam6:21)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1SA 1:3

## 1 Samuel 1:4 (id: 16779)

*Sacrifice … portions \[of the meat]*: Some sacrifices included sharing part of the animal in a community meal (see [Leviticus 7:11–34](https://ref.ly/Lev7:11-Lev7:34)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1SA 1:4

## 1 Samuel 1:7 (id: 16780)

*the house of the LORD*: This is another name for the tabernacle. It is also known as “the temple of the LORD” in [1 Samuel 1:9](https://ref.ly/1Sam1:9). These names show that the tabernacle, a portable building, was the main sanctuary in Shiloh.

* **Associated Passages:** 1SA 1:7

## 1 Samuel 1:9 (id: 16781)

*the temple of the LORD*: This means the Lord's sanctuary. Solomon's Temple was not built yet, so *temple* here refers to the Lord's holy place.

* **Associated Passages:** 1SA 1:9

## 1 Samuel 1:11 (id: 16770)

Hannah promised to dedicate her child to the Lord as a Nazirite (see [Numbers 6:1–21](https://ref.ly/Num6:1-Num6:21)). She might have hoped her child would be like Samson, a deliverer of God's people (compare [Judges 13](https://ref.ly/Judg13:1-Judg13:25)). A deliverer was someone who rescued the Israelites from their enemies

* **Associated Passages:** 1SA 1:11

## 1 Samuel 1:13–14 (id: 16771)

Some people may have used the feast times at Shiloh to drink too much alcohol instead of worshiping. Eli wrongly thought Hannah was just another person who was drunk (see [Acts 2:13–15](https://ref.ly/Acts2:13-Acts2:15)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1SA 1:13–1SA 1:14

## 1 Samuel 1:16 (id: 16772)

*wicked woman (*Hebrew *a daughter of Belial)*: This phrase describes a worthless person. Belial means "worthlessness" and people later used it as a name for Satan ([2 Corinthians 6:15](https://ref.ly/2Cor6:15)). In Hebrew, a *son of* or *daughter of* a quality refers to someone who shows that quality strongly.

* **Associated Passages:** 1SA 1:16

## 1 Samuel 1:17–18 (id: 16773)

A blessing was more than just wishful thinking. It was often God's way of giving a real benefit (see, for example, [Genesis 27:1–40](https://ref.ly/Gen27:1-Gen27:40); [28:1–4](https://ref.ly/Gen28:1-Gen28:4); [32:22–32](https://ref.ly/Gen32:22-Gen32:32); [48:1–49:28](https://ref.ly/Gen48:1-Gen49:28)). Because this blessing from God's high priest assured Hannah that her prayer would be answered, she was no longer sad.

* **Associated Passages:** 1SA 1:17–1SA 1:18

## 1 Samuel 1:22 (id: 16775)

*After the boy is weaned:* Hannah likely nursed Samuel for two to four years.

* **Associated Passages:** 1SA 1:22

## 1 Samuel 1:23 (id: 16776)

Elkanah could have canceled Hannah’s promise (see [Numbers 30:12–14](https://ref.ly/Num30:12-Num30:14)). But he chose to affirm and support it instead.

* **Associated Passages:** 1SA 1:23

## 1 Samuel 2:1 (id: 16959)

*my horn is exalted*: Literally *has lifted my horn*; see also [1 Samuel 2:10](https://ref.ly/1Sam2:10). The horn of a strong animal, like an ox or bull, was a symbol of strength. It was raised in victory after defeating an enemy (see also [1 Kings 22:11](https://ref.ly/1Kgs22:11)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1SA 2:1

## 1 Samuel 2:1–10 (id: 16953)

Hannah’s Prayer of Praise celebrates Samuel's dedication to serving God. It highlights God's: 

* Uniqueness ([1 Samuel 2:1–2](https://ref.ly/1Sam2:1-1Sam2:2))
* Power to change fortunes ([1 Samuel 2:3–9](https://ref.ly/1Sam2:3-1Sam2:9))
* Ability to strengthen his chosen king ([1 Samuel 2:10](https://ref.ly/1Sam2:10))

Like Mary’s Song of Praise in [Luke 1:46–55](https://ref.ly/Luke1:46-Luke1:55), Hannah’s prayer emphasizes God bringing down the rich and powerful and lifting up the poor and oppressed ([1 Samuel 2:7–8](https://ref.ly/1Sam2:7-1Sam2:8); [Luke 1:52–53](https://ref.ly/Luke1:52-Luke1:53)). David’s prayer in [2 Samuel 22](https://ref.ly/2Sam22:1-2Sam22:51) is another beautiful statement of God’s saving power for his chosen king ([1 Samuel 2:10](https://ref.ly/1Sam2:10)). God will bring down the rich, unrighteous rulers (like Eli, Saul, or Herod). Leaders who follow God's will like Samuel, David or Jesus will be lifted up to a higher position or status.

* **Associated Passages:** 1SA 2:1–1SA 2:10

## 1 Samuel 2:2 (id: 16967)

* *no one besides You*: David reacted the same way after hearing God's promises about his kingship ([2 Samuel 7:22](https://ref.ly/2Sam7:22)).
* *Rock* (compare [2 Samuel 22:2–3](https://ref.ly/2Sam22:2-2Sam22:3), [32](https://ref.ly/2Sam22:32)): God offers stability and security to those who trust in him.

* **Associated Passages:** 1SA 2:2

## 1 Samuel 2:3 (id: 16971)

*Do not boast so proudly, or let arrogance…*: Peninnah showed this attitude (see [1 Samuel 1:6–7](https://ref.ly/1Sam1:6-1Sam1:7)). In contrast, Hannah was humbly dependent on God. This means she did not think too highly of herself. Instead, she trusted in God and relied on him for help.

* **Associated Passages:** 1SA 2:3

## 1 Samuel 2:4–8 (id: 16972)

Hannah celebrated God's power to completely change people's situations.

* **Associated Passages:** 1SA 2:4–1SA 2:8

## 1 Samuel 2:5 (id: 16973)

* Those who were hungry now have enough to eat (see [1 Samuel 1:7](https://ref.ly/1Sam1:7), [18](https://ref.ly/1Sam1:18)).
* The phrase *seven children* poetically means that a woman without children would be blessed with a home full of children (see [1 Samuel 2:21](https://ref.ly/1Sam2:21)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1SA 2:5

## 1 Samuel 2:7–8 (id: 16974)

Compare with [Psalm 113:7–9](https://ref.ly/Ps113:7-Ps113:9).

* **Associated Passages:** 1SA 2:7–1SA 2:8

## 1 Samuel 2:8 (id: 16975)

The entire earth belongs to the Lord. God, who created and rules everything, can:

* change circumstances ([1 Samuel 2:4–8](https://ref.ly/1Sam2:4-1Sam2:8)),
* protect those who are faithful ([1 Samuel 2:9](https://ref.ly/1Sam2:9)),
* judge those who are wicked, and
* give strength to his chosen king ([1 Samuel 2:10](https://ref.ly/1Sam2:10)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1SA 2:8

## 1 Samuel 2:10 (id: 16954)

* The king was to use his God\-given power to help the oppressed, the hungry, and those unable to have children (see [Psalm 72:1 4](https://ref.ly/Ps72:1-Ps72:4), [12–14](https://ref.ly/Ps72:12-Ps72:14); [Proverbs 31:8–9](https://ref.ly/Prov31:8-Prov31:9)).
* *He will exalt the horn**:* See study note on 1 Samuel 2:1.
* *His anointed*(Hebrew *mashiakh*): This part of Hannah’s prayer predicts both Israel’s anointed kings and God’s ultimate Anointed King—the Messiah, Jesus Christ (see [1 Samuel 12:3–5](https://ref.ly/1Sam12:3-1Sam12:5); [24:6](https://ref.ly/1Sam24:6), [10](https://ref.ly/1Sam24:10); [Psalm 132:17](https://ref.ly/Ps132:17); [Daniel 9:25–26](https://ref.ly/Dan9:25-Dan9:26)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1SA 2:10
* **Associated Articles:** 1 Samuel 2:1 (ID: `16959@TyndaleStudyNotes`)

## 1 Samuel 2:12 (id: 16955)

* *wicked men* (Hebrew *sons of Belial*): See study note on 1:16.
* *had no regard for* (literally *did not know*) *the LORD:* Even though they were priests among God's people, they ignored God and did not follow his will (compare [Jeremiah 2:8](https://ref.ly/Jer2:8)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1SA 2:12
* **Associated Articles:** 1 Samuel 1:16 (ID: `16772@TyndaleStudyNotes`)

## 1 Samuel 2:13–17 (id: 16956)

The priests were meant to take their share of the meat only after it was boiled (see [Numbers 6:19](https://ref.ly/Num6:19)). Eli’s sons ignored God's rules ([1 Samuel 2:13–14](https://ref.ly/1Sam2:13-1Sam2:14), [17](https://ref.ly/1Sam2:17)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1SA 2:13–1SA 2:17

## 1 Samuel 2:15 (id: 16957)

God's law stated that the fat from a sacrificial animal belonged to the Lord. The priests had to burn the fat on the altar before anything else could be done with the animal ([Leviticus 3:3–17](https://ref.ly/Lev3:3-Lev3:17)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1SA 2:15

## 1 Samuel 2:18 (id: 16958)

* The phrase *Samuel served the Lord* refers to the religious duties of Levites and priests (see, for example, [Numbers 3:4](https://ref.ly/Num3:4); [8:19](https://ref.ly/Num8:19), [24](https://ref.ly/Num8:24); [Deuteronomy 18:7](https://ref.ly/Deut18:7)). Samuel, like Eli's sons, was a Levite (see study note on 1 Samuel 1:1). However, unlike Eli's sons, Samuel performed his duties well.
* He wore a linen garment similar to what priests wore when serving in the sanctuary (see study note on 1 Samuel 22:18).

* **Associated Passages:** 1SA 2:18
* **Associated Articles:** 1 Samuel 1:1 (ID: `16774@TyndaleStudyNotes`); 1 Samuel 22:18 (ID: `17004@TyndaleStudyNotes`)

## 1 Samuel 2:20 (id: 16960)

*Eli would bless*: Blessing was one of the functions of a priest ([Numbers 6:23–27](https://ref.ly/Num6:23-Num6:27); [Deuteronomy 10:8](https://ref.ly/Deut10:8); [1 Chronicles 23:13](https://ref.ly/1Chr23:13)). See study note on 1 Samuel 1:17–18.

* **Associated Articles:** 1 Samuel 1:17-18 (ID: `16773@TyndaleStudyNotes`)

## 1 Samuel 2:22 (id: 16962)

* *sleeping with the women*: Eli’s sons were likely influenced by Canaanite religious practices, which included sex as part of the ceremony.
* *who served at the entrance*: See [Exodus 38:8](https://ref.ly/Exod38:8).

* **Associated Passages:** 1SA 2:22

## 1 Samuel 2:22–25 (id: 16961)

Eli's weak efforts to correct his the behavior of his sons (see [1 Samuel 2:29](https://ref.ly/1Sam2:29)) show he raised them without discipline ([1 Samuel 3:13](https://ref.ly/1Sam3:13)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1SA 2:22–1SA 2:25

## 1 Samuel 2:25 (id: 16963)

* *God* (or *the judges*; Hebrew *’elohim*): The Hebrew word translated *intercede* is plural here. When ’elohim means "God" it often takes a singular verb. Some ancient translations interpret ’*elohim* as “judges” in this context. If so, the judges would mediate for the guilty in a human court. Yet, many Hebrew scholars argue that *’elohim* should not be translated as “judges.” If so, how could God *intercede* for the man who sinned*?* Eli might have believed that court decisions came directly from God. God might work through his written laws or through other events to either free or find guilty a person accused of doing something wrong. Or Eli might have been talking about the system of animal sacrifices.
* The sexual wrongdoing in ([1 Samuel 2:22](https://ref.ly/1Sam2:22)) and excessive eating in ([1 Samuel 2:12–17](https://ref.ly/1Sam2:12-1Sam2:17)) of Eli’s sons were sins against the Lord. This was because they were corrupting how Israel worshiped God. No one can speak to God on behalf of sinners who completely refuse to follow God's will (see [Matthew 12:31](https://ref.ly/Matt12:31)).
* Eli’s sons ignored their father because the Lord had already started to punish them by making their hearts stubborn (see [Exodus 4:21](https://ref.ly/Exod4:21); [7:3](https://ref.ly/Exod7:3); [8:15–32](https://ref.ly/Exod8:15-Exod8:32); [10:27](https://ref.ly/Exod10:27); [11:10](https://ref.ly/Exod11:10)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1SA 2:25

## 1 Samuel 2:26 (id: 16964)

As children, both Samuel and Jesus had extraordinary qualities ([1 Samuel 2:21](https://ref.ly/1Sam2:21); see also [Luke 2:40](https://ref.ly/Luke2:40), [52](https://ref.ly/Luke2:52)). Samuel was one of Jesus' forerunners (someone who came before and prepared the way). Samuel showed what would happen to Jesus through his words, actions, and sometimes through events in his own life that were similar to what would happen in Jesus' life.

* **Associated Passages:** 1SA 2:26

## 1 Samuel 2:27 (id: 16965)

"Man of God" is another name for a prophet ([1 Samuel 9:6](https://ref.ly/1Sam9:6); [1 Kings 13:1](https://ref.ly/1Kgs13:1); [2 Kings 1:9](https://ref.ly/2Kgs1:9)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1SA 2:27

## 1 Samuel 2:29 (id: 16966)

Eli did not stop his sons from doing wrong, showing disrespect for God's sacrifices and offerings. Eli gained from their actions, so God blamed him for allowing it.

* **Associated Passages:** 1SA 2:29

## 1 Samuel 2:30 (id: 16968)

*that your house and the house of your father would walk before Me forever*: See [Exodus 29:9](https://ref.ly/Exod29:9) and [Numbers 25:13](https://ref.ly/Num25:13). God will honor another of Aaron’s descendants (see study note on 1 Samuel 2:35) and reject Eli’s family, removing them from the priesthood ([1 Samuel 2:31–35](https://ref.ly/1Sam2:31-1Sam2:35)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1SA 2:30
* **Associated Articles:** 1 Samuel 2:35 (ID: `16970@TyndaleStudyNotes`)

## 1 Samuel 2:32–33 (id: 16969)

*reach old age*: In the Old Testament, a short life often shows God's disapproval. A long life shows God's blessing (see [Genesis 15:15](https://ref.ly/Gen15:15); [1 Kings 3:14](https://ref.ly/1Kgs3:14); [Psalm 91:16](https://ref.ly/Ps91:16)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1SA 2:32–1SA 2:33

## 1 Samuel 2:35 (id: 16970)

*a faithful priest*: Zadok and his family later took over the priesthood from Eli's family ([1 Kings 2:26–27](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:26-1Kgs2:27), [35](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:35)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1SA 2:35

## 1 Samuel 3:1 (id: 17101)

*the word of the LORD was rare, and visions were scarce*: God was not revealing his will through prophets or priests. This means that God was not regularly speaking to his people or giving them guidance.

However, this time of spiritual darkness was about to end when God began to communicate with Samuel ([1 Samuel 3:2–4:1a](https://ref.ly/1Sam3:2-1Sam4:1)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1SA 3:1

## 1 Samuel 3:2 (id: 17104)

Eli was almost blind*,* both physically and spiritually ([3:1](https://ref.ly/1Sam3:1)).

## 1 Samuel 3:3 (id: 17105)

The priests were responsible for keeping the lamp of God burning through the night ([Exod 27:20–21](https://ref.ly/Exod27:20-Exod27:21); [30:7–8](https://ref.ly/Exod30:7-Exod30:8)). • That Samuel was sleeping . . . near the Ark symbolizes his nearness to God’s presence and purpose, in contrast to Eli and his sons.

* **Associated Passages:** 1SA 3:3

## 1 Samuel 3:7 (id: 17106)

Samuel did not yet know the Lord: He lacked direct experience of the Lord. In contrast, Eli’s sons did not know the Lord (see study note on 2:12) in that they were morally and spiritually deficient.

* **Associated Passages:** 1SA 3:7
* **Associated Articles:** 1 Samuel 2:12 (ID: `16955@TyndaleStudyNotes`)

Eli realized: Despite his many shortcomings, Eli was not completely without spiritual insight.

* **Associated Passages:** 1SA 3:8

## 1 Samuel 3:10 (id: 17094)

The doubling of the name calls attention to the seriousness of the moment (cp. [Gen 22:11](https://ref.ly/Gen22:11); [Exod 3:4](https://ref.ly/Exod3:4); [Matt 27:46](https://ref.ly/Matt27:46); [Luke 22:31](https://ref.ly/Luke22:31); [Acts 9:4](https://ref.ly/Acts9:4)). • Samuel omits “Lord” (see [1 Sam 3:9](https://ref.ly/1Sam3:9)) from his response either out of reverence for the name or because of a lingering uncertainty about who was speaking.

* **Associated Passages:** 1SA 3:10

## 1 Samuel 3:11 (id: 17095)

The phrase a shocking thing conveys the magnitude and severity of God’s judgment. God’s actions would also be of national significance for Israel (cp. [2 Kgs 21:12](https://ref.ly/2Kgs21:12); [Jer 19:3](https://ref.ly/Jer19:3)).

his sons are blaspheming God: They were expressing contempt for God through their actions. • hasn’t disciplined them: Eli rebuked his sons ([2:23–25](https://ref.ly/1Sam2:23-1Sam2:25)), but he did not restrain them.

* **Associated Passages:** 1SA 3:13

## 1 Samuel 3:14 (id: 17098)

Neither blood sacrifices nor offerings would be acceptable on behalf of Eli and his sons. The offerings of [Lev 4–5](https://ref.ly/Lev4:1-Lev5:19) were for sins committed inadvertently or unintentionally, whereas the sins of Eli and his sons were deliberate and rebellious.

* **Associated Passages:** 1SA 3:14

## 1 Samuel 3:15 (id: 17099)

Samuel was afraid to tell Eli of God’s plans for him and his family either because he respected Eli’s position or he feared for his own safety.

the Philistines: See “The Philistines” Profile. • The exact location of Ebenezer is unknown. It was probably just east of Aphek (see also [1 Sam 7:12](https://ref.ly/1Sam7:12) and corresponding study note). • Aphek was west of Shiloh, well inland and well north of Philistine territory. By camping there, the Philistines might have been trying to seize more Israelite territory.

The crisis surrounding the Ark of the Covenant demonstrated Israel’s need for Samuel’s leadership and fulfilled prophecies about Eli and his sons ([3:11–14](https://ref.ly/1Sam3:11-1Sam3:14)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1SA 4:1–1SA 4:22

## 1 Samuel 4:3 (id: 17146)

The Israelites were often defeated in war because of the sin of one individual or the entire nation ([Josh 7](https://ref.ly/Josh7:1-Josh7:26)). In this defeat, no one inquired whether sin was the cause; apparently no one had even asked the Lord whether they should engage the Philistines in the first place (cp. [1 Chr 14:13–16](https://ref.ly/1Chr14:13-1Chr14:16)). Instead, the Israelites treated the Ark*,* the most sacred symbol of the Lord’s presence, as a charm to ward off misfortune. Carrying the Ark into battle was not necessarily wrong (cp. [Josh 6:2–21](https://ref.ly/Josh6:2-Josh6:21)), but neither would this act ensure God’s blessing and victory.

## 1 Samuel 4:18 (id: 17143)

Eli fell backward: Either he was startled or he had a heart attack when he heard the message. Eli’s fatal fall symbolizes his family’s fall from the priesthood and the end of the abomination that his sons began ([2:12–17](https://ref.ly/1Sam2:12-1Sam2:17)). • Israel’s judge: Priesthood and judgeship were not incompatible (cp. [Exod 18:13–26](https://ref.ly/Exod18:13-Exod18:26); [Deut 17:8–13](https://ref.ly/Deut17:8-Deut17:13)). Samuel replaced Eli as Israel’s judge and provided leadership that Eli had failed to provide (see [1 Sam 7:12–17](https://ref.ly/1Sam7:12-1Sam7:17)). • The phrase for forty years incorporates Eli’s career into the conceptual and temporal framework of the book of Judges (cp. [Judg 3:11](https://ref.ly/Judg3:11); [5:31](https://ref.ly/Judg5:31); [8:28](https://ref.ly/Judg8:28); [13:1](https://ref.ly/Judg13:1)).

The name Ichabod contains the Hebrew word kabod (glory*;* see [Exod 24:15–17](https://ref.ly/Exod24:15-Exod24:17)). A similar word is used to describe Eli in [1 Sam 4:18](https://ref.ly/1Sam4:18) (Hebrew kabed*,* “heavy”). The disappearance of the Ark parallels the demise of Eli’s house. Although the Israelites experienced a stunning loss of divine glory and protection (cp.

Dagon was one of the Philistines’ gods (see [Judg 16:23–24](https://ref.ly/Judg16:23-Judg16:24)). The name could be related to the Hebrew dag (“fish”), an appropriate name for a god of seafaring people. More likely, it reflects the Hebrew dagan (“grain”), suggesting a fertility or agriculture god.

Worship of Canaanite deities was an ongoing problem throughout Israel’s history. The people started worshiping idols during the twenty\-year period mentioned in [7:2](https://ref.ly/1Sam7:2), or perhaps they had done so ever since the days of the judges ([8:8](https://ref.ly/1Sam8:8); [Judg 6:25](https://ref.ly/Judg6:25); cp.

Earlier, Saul had employed 330,000 troops to fight against a much less formidable foe ([11:8](https://ref.ly/1Sam11:8)). The selection here of 3,000 special troops probably does not reflect overconfidence (cp. [Josh 7:3–4](https://ref.ly/Josh7:3-Josh7:4)). Rather, Saul likely recognized the need for a smaller, highly trained, elite militia to deal with the troublesome Philistines (see [1 Sam 14:52](https://ref.ly/1Sam14:52)). • Micmash was located in Benjamin about two miles northwest of Saul’s home in Gibeah.

Saul and his men directly disobeyed the Lord’s command to “completely destroy” the Amalekites ([15:3](https://ref.ly/1Sam15:3)). Though the entire army participated in the disobedience of God’s command, Saul alone was responsible as their leader.

Carmel was a town near Hebron in southern Judah. • Saul commemorated his own accomplishments by erecting a monument to himself. In reality, he had earned shame ([15:16–19](https://ref.ly/1Sam15:16-1Sam15:19)). • Gilgal: See [13:4](https://ref.ly/1Sam13:4).

I have carried out the Lord’s command! Cp. [15:3](https://ref.ly/1Sam15:3). Saul apparently thought his actions were justified ([15:15](https://ref.ly/1Sam15:15); cp. [Lev 22:19](https://ref.ly/Lev22:19)). Samuel, however, cut through Saul’s pretense ([1 Sam 15:17–19](https://ref.ly/1Sam15:17-1Sam15:19)) and carried out God’s command himself ([15:32–33](https://ref.ly/1Sam15:32-1Sam15:33)).

I was afraid of the people: Saul continued to blame others (see [15:15](https://ref.ly/1Sam15:15),[21](https://ref.ly/1Sam15:21)). • what they demanded: There is no hint of such pressure in the chapter. Saul’s confession appears dishonest (cp. David, [2 Sam 12:13](https://ref.ly/2Sam12:13); [Ps 51](https://ref.ly/Ps51:1-Ps51:19)).

The verb phrase mourned constantly is usually used for grieving over someone’s death. Although Saul was still living, his royalty was coming to an end.

## 1 Samuel 16:1–23 (id: 16898)

David was Saul’s replacement. There are striking similarities between the two: Samuel anointed both. Neither was pursuing the position. Both were unlikely candidates (Saul was from the smallest tribe; David was the youngest son). Both were impressive in appearance ([9:2](https://ref.ly/1Sam9:2); [16:12](https://ref.ly/1Sam16:12)). And the Spirit came mightily on each when he was anointed king ([10:10](https://ref.ly/1Sam10:10); [11:6](https://ref.ly/1Sam11:6); [16:13](https://ref.ly/1Sam16:13)). The key difference was that David was “a man after \[God’s] own heart” ([13:14](https://ref.ly/1Sam13:14); cp. [16:7](https://ref.ly/1Sam16:7)), while Saul was not.

[Exod 3:18–22](https://ref.ly/Exod3:18-Exod3:22)). In Samuel’s role as a priestly judge, he would not have raised any suspicions by offering a sacrifice (see[1 Sam 10:8](https://ref.ly/1Sam10:8)).

David and Jonathan had much in common: both were young and capable, were military heroes, had a robust faith in God, and had a claim to the throne of Israel. It is a testimony to Jonathan’s true character that he recognized and supported God’s choice of David to be the next king of Israel (see [18:3–4](https://ref.ly/1Sam18:3-1Sam18:4); [20:12–17](https://ref.ly/1Sam20:12-1Sam20:17)). • Jonathan loved David: See [20:17](https://ref.ly/1Sam20:17); [2 Sam 1:26](https://ref.ly/2Sam1:26).

The presence of an idol in the home of David and Michal might show the pervasive influence of pagan idol worship among the Israelites; perhaps the idol belonged to Michal. Apparently David did not object to its presence. (Cp. Rachel’s theft of her father’s household idols in [Gen 31:19](https://ref.ly/Gen31:19).) • Siblings Jonathan ([1 Sam 19:1–7](https://ref.ly/1Sam19:1-1Sam19:7)) and Michal ([19:11–18](https://ref.ly/1Sam19:11-1Sam19:18)) saved David from their father and undermined their father’s plans to eliminate him.

may the Lord strike me: Jonathan invoked a curse upon himself to reassure David that he would keep his promise. • as he used to be with my father: Jonathan recognized that David had received the blessing from God that his father had once had. The divine favor that had brought Saul into royal office ([9:14–10:1](https://ref.ly/1Sam9:14-1Sam10:1)) would bring David into royal office as Saul’s replacement. Jonathan accepted this even though he was the natural successor to Saul.

Jonathan’s ruse would allow David to get the message even if there could be no face\-to\-face meeting; the boy’s presence would allay suspicion and provide Jonathan an alibi for going to the field. As it happened, no one but the boy accompanied Jonathan to the field, so when the boy left, David was able to speak with Jonathan face to face ([20:40–42](https://ref.ly/1Sam20:40-1Sam20:42)).

A number of circumstances could render a person ceremonially unclean and thus unfit for attending a sacred festival (see [Lev 7:20–21](https://ref.ly/Lev7:20-Lev7:21)). Often, an unclean person was required to be excluded from such functions only until the evening of the same day ([Lev 15](https://ref.ly/Lev15:1-Lev15:33)). This explains why Saul became suspicious after David did not arrive the next day. • Saul referred to David as the son of Jesse (also in [1 Sam 20:31](https://ref.ly/1Sam20:31); [22:7](https://ref.ly/1Sam22:7)), a description that functioned as David’s surname.

On both occasions, a prominent individual who had strained relations with Saul showed up unannounced. Both Ahimelech and the Bethlehem elders were concerned about being suspected of supporting an enemy of the king, which could result in death.

Typically, such bread would not be available for consumption by laity.

*Paran*: According to the Masoretic Text, David went to the wilderness of *Paran* after Samuel’s death. The Septuagint instead reads *Maon*, which fits better with the following story set in the Maon/Carmel area of Judah. This town in southern Judah (see study note on 1 Samuel 23:24) was probably Nabal’s home. The wilderness of Paran itself lay much farther south, in the northern Sinai near Kadesh\-barnea, and is elsewhere described as a place of refuge ([Genesis 21:21](https://ref.ly/Gen21:21); [1 Kings 11:18](https://ref.ly/1Kgs11:18)).

Ahinoam was also the name of Saul’s wife ([14:50](https://ref.ly/1Sam14:50)).
