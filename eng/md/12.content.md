## 2 Kings 1:1 (id: 14436)

After Ahab’s death, the Moabites felt secure enough to declare themselves free of their Israelite overlords (see [3:4–5](https://ref.ly/2Kgs3:4-2Kgs3:5)). The historical notice anticipates the troubles that Israel would experience after the short\-lived reign of Ahaziah (see [1 Kgs 22:51](https://ref.ly/1Kgs22:51)).

## 2 Kings 1:2 (id: 14437)

An upper room or balcony enclosed with latticework was common; it allowed for the free flow of air and a degree of privacy, but *latticework* was easily broken. • Baal\-zebub (*lord of flies*) may be a parody of a Canaanite deity named Baal\-zebul (*Baal is prince*). The name of this deity was later used for Satan (see study note on Matt 10:25). Ahaziah followed his father Ahab in worshiping Baal.

## 2 Kings 1:3–4 (id: 14438)

The angel of the Lord does not seem to be a christophany in the book of Kings, as in other Old Testament texts (e.g., [Judg 6:11–18](https://ref.ly/Judg6:11-Judg6:18)). • Elijah, who had previously confronted Ahaziah’s father, Ahab, had a twofold message for the king: a condemnation for failure to acknowledge that Yahweh, not Baal, is God (see [1 Kgs 18:16–18](https://ref.ly/1Kgs18:16-1Kgs18:18)), and a pronouncement of doom (see [1 Kgs 21:17–24](https://ref.ly/1Kgs21:17-1Kgs21:24)).

## 2 Kings 1:9–10 (id: 14439)

The arrogant words of the army captain contained a contradiction, which Elijah pointed out: If Elijah was a man of God (i.e., God’s prophet), then his authority was from God and to ignore him was to invite peril ([Deut 18:15–19](https://ref.ly/Deut18:15-Deut18:19)). • Fire often symbolizes the presence of God in the Scriptures (see [Exod 3:1–6](https://ref.ly/Exod3:1-Exod3:6); [19:18](https://ref.ly/Exod19:18); cp. [1 Kgs 18:38](https://ref.ly/1Kgs18:38)). • Fifty soldiers was a common grouping ([1 Kgs 18:4](https://ref.ly/1Kgs18:4)); here it indicates a division within Israel’s military organization.

## 2 Kings 2:8 (id: 14592)

Elijah folded his cloak together and struck the water with it: Such symbolic actions visually represented God’s power (see [Exod 14:16](https://ref.ly/Exod14:16), [21](https://ref.ly/Exod14:21), [26–27](https://ref.ly/Exod14:26-Exod14:27); [17:8–13](https://ref.ly/Exod17:8-Exod17:13); [1 Kgs 11:30–31](https://ref.ly/1Kgs11:30-1Kgs11:31); [Ezek 4](https://ref.ly/Ezek4:1-Ezek4:17); [5:1–4](https://ref.ly/Ezek5:1-Ezek5:4)).

## 2 Kings 2:11 (id: 14585)

Chariot of fire … horses of fire … whirlwind: These things represent God’s appearance in mighty power (cp. [Isa 66:15](https://ref.ly/Isa66:15)). • Elijah was carried … into heaven, like Enoch ([Gen 5:24](https://ref.ly/Gen5:24)), without dying. Some believe that Enoch and Elijah will reappear at the time of the end (see study note on Rev 11:1–13).

## 2 Kings 2:12 (id: 14586)

## 2 Kings 2:13–15 (id: 14587)

Elisha picked up Elijah’s cloak and successfully parted the Jordan River. Elisha was indeed Elijah’s successor, as the other prophets recognized.

* **Associated Passages:** 2KI 2:13–2KI 2:15
* **Associated Articles:** 

## 2 Kings 2:16–18 (id: 14588)

The prophets searched the wilderness, perhaps to be certain that Elijah had not temporarily disappeared (cp. [1 Kgs 18:12](https://ref.ly/1Kgs18:12)). Elisha already knew that the search was pointless.

* **Associated Passages:** 2KI 2:16–2KI 2:18
* **Associated Articles:** 

## 2 Kings 2:20–22 (id: 14590)

Elisha used a new bowl ([Deut 21:3](https://ref.ly/Deut21:3)) filled with salt ([Lev 2:13](https://ref.ly/Lev2:13); [Ezek 43:24](https://ref.ly/Ezek43:24)) to symbolize calling upon God to purify the people and the environment. Elisha made it clear that the Lord, not he or the *salt,* had purified this water.

* **Associated Passages:** 2KI 2:20–2KI 2:22
* **Associated Articles:** 

## 2 Kings 2:23 (id: 14591)

The group of boys could have been young adults; the Hebrew term has a wide range of meanings, at times being used of a young adult still unskilled in his profession, such as when Solomon petitioned the Lord for wisdom because he was young and inexperienced ([1 Kgs 3:7](https://ref.ly/1Kgs3:7)). Joshua’s spies at Jericho were designated by the same term ([Josh 6:22–23](https://ref.ly/Josh6:22-Josh6:23)). • To call someone baldy was disrespectful. The young men told Elisha to go away (literally *go up*), mocking Elisha’s God\-given position as successor to Elijah.

* **Associated Passages:** 2KI 2:23
* **Associated Articles:** 

## 2 Kings 3:2 (id: 14684)

Ahab apparently erected the sacred pillar (or *stela*) of Baal when instituting Baal worship (see [1 Kgs 16:32–33](https://ref.ly/1Kgs16:32-1Kgs16:33)). Similar stones were also erected to pagan deities in Judah ([1 Kgs 14:23](https://ref.ly/1Kgs14:23)); such pillars were later purged by Jehu ([2 Kgs 10:26–27](https://ref.ly/2Kgs10:26-2Kgs10:27)) and Josiah ([23:13–15](https://ref.ly/2Kgs23:13-2Kgs23:15)).

* **Associated Passages:** 2KI 3:2
* **Associated Articles:** 

## 2 Kings 3:4–5 (id: 14686)

The Moabite rebellion (see [1:1](https://ref.ly/2Kgs1:1)) began with the withholding of the annual tribute. The Moabite Stone (Mesha Stela) records details of Israel’s domination of northern Moab in the days of Omri and Ahab, a subservience that continued into the reigns of Ahaziah and Joram.

* **Associated Passages:** 2KI 3:4–2KI 3:5

* **Associated Articles:** 

## 2 Kings 3:6–7 (id: 14687)

Jehoshaphat*’*s ready compliance with Joram*’*s appeal was typical of his participation in the undertakings of the northern kings ([1 Kgs 22:4](https://ref.ly/1Kgs22:4); [2 Chr 20:35–37](https://ref.ly/2Chr20:35-2Chr20:37)). The marriage of Jehoshaphat’s son Jehoram to Ahab’s daughter Athaliah ([2 Chr 18:1](https://ref.ly/2Chr18:1); [21:6](https://ref.ly/2Chr21:6)) heightened Jehoshaphat’s entanglement with Israel.

* **Associated Passages:** 2KI 3:6–2KI 3:7
* **Associated Articles:** 

## 2 Kings 3:8–9 (id: 14688)

The king of Edom … joined them: Edom was apparently a vassal kingdom to Judah at this time. Later, in the days of Jehoshaphat’s son Jehoram, Edom successfully rebelled against Judah ([8:20–22](https://ref.ly/2Kgs8:20-2Kgs8:22)). The southern route through Edom avoided strong Moabite fortifications, but it was dangerous because water was scarce.

* **Associated Passages:** 2KI 3:8–2KI 3:9
* **Associated Articles:** 

## 2 Kings 3:11–12 (id: 14677)

Is there no prophet of the Lord with us? Diviners or prophets often traveled with armies to perceive the divine will. Jehoshaphat again desired an oracle from a true prophet to learn the Lord’s intentions for the battle (cp. [1 Kgs 22:7](https://ref.ly/1Kgs22:7)). However, this time he waited until the campaign had begun before inquiring of the Lord.

* **Associated Passages:** 2KI 3:11–2KI 3:12
* **Associated Articles:** 

## 2 Kings 3:13–14 (id: 14678)

Elisha participated because of Jehoshaphat’s presence, despite his entanglement with the pagan Joram.

## 2 Kings 3:26 (id: 14682)

The reason for the Moabite king’s attempt to break through the enemy lines might have been to avenge himself against the Edomite king or to escape through a perceived weakness in the allied lines.

* **Associated Passages:** 2KI 3:26
* **Associated Articles:** 

## 2 Kings 3:27 (id: 14683)

So there was great anger against Israel: The Hebrew phrase translated *great anger* occurs elsewhere to describe the Lord’s fury against Israel for covenant violations ([Jer 21:5](https://ref.ly/Jer21:5); [32:37](https://ref.ly/Jer32:37); [Zech 7:12](https://ref.ly/Zech7:12)).

The widow’s husband had been a member of the group of prophets … who served Elisha ([2:3–18](https://ref.ly/2Kgs2:3-2Kgs2:18)). • take my two sons as slaves: The law of Moses allowed a creditor to place a debtor and his children into slavery to work off a debt ([Exod 21:2–4](https://ref.ly/Exod21:2-Exod21:4); [Lev 25:10](https://ref.ly/Lev25:10)).

* **Associated Passages:** 2KI 4:1

shut the door: Elisha was meeting a private need; the miracle was not for public show. • Olive oil, an important staple, had commercial value (see [1 Kgs 5:11](https://ref.ly/1Kgs5:11); [2 Chr 11:11](https://ref.ly/2Chr11:11); [Hos 12:1](https://ref.ly/Hos12:1)).

Elisha’s dealings with the woman from Shunem are presented in two parallel sections ([4:8–20](https://ref.ly/2Kgs4:8-2Kgs4:20), [21–37](https://ref.ly/2Kgs4:21-2Kgs4:37)). Shunem was a border town in the tribal allotment to Issachar ([Josh 19:18](https://ref.ly/Josh19:18)).

* **Associated Passages:** 2KI 4:8–2KI 4:37
* **Associated Articles:**

Because the Shunemite woman recognized that Elisha was a true prophet—a holy man of God—she wished to provide hospitality for him during his frequent travels (see [Isa 58:7](https://ref.ly/Isa58:7); [Heb 13:2](https://ref.ly/Heb13:2); [3 Jn 1:5](https://ref.ly/3John1:5)). • A small room … on the roof, reached by an outside stairway, assured privacy for both Elisha and his hosts.

* **Associated Passages:** 2KI 4:9–2KI 4:10
* **Associated Articles:** 

## 2 Kings 4:11–14 (id: 14689)

Elisha wanted to return some favor to his host. • his servant Gehazi: Gehazi served as an apprentice, as Elisha had served with Elijah ([1 Kgs 19:21](https://ref.ly/1Kgs19:21)). It would not be unusual for a prophet to consult with his attendant.

Mount Carmel lay about twenty miles northwest of Shunem. The length of the trip and the woman’s obvious haste aroused Elisha’s suspicion that some tragedy concerning the child had occurred. • “everything is fine”: The woman brushed off Gehazi’s inquiries; she was resolved to deal with no one but Elisha.

Elisha instructed Gehazi not to talk to anyone along the way, indicating the seriousness and urgency of the mission. Jesus gave similar instructions when he sent out the seventy\-two disciples ([Luke 10:4](https://ref.ly/Luke10:4)). • Laying Elisha’s staff on the child’s face signified the prophet’s intention to identify with the boy and claim God’s power.

shut the door: Elisha followed the same procedure he had advised the widow to take earlier ([4:4](https://ref.ly/2Kgs4:4)). If God were to perform the miracle, it would not be for public display. Only the mother knew of the boy’s death and only she needed to know of Elisha’s efforts to petition God for the boy’s life.

grain … loaves of barley … first grain: This offering was similar to the first of the crops that were normally presented to God ([Lev 23:20](https://ref.ly/Lev23:20)) and to the priests ([Deut 18:4–5](https://ref.ly/Deut18:4-Deut18:5)) as their portion. Because of the famine, Elisha shared the offering with all the people. • Elisha’s feeding a hundred people with a sack of fresh grain and twenty loaves of barley bread anticipated the miraculous ministry of Jesus ([Matt 14:15–21](https://ref.ly/Matt14:15-Matt14:21); [15:32–38](https://ref.ly/Matt15:32-Matt15:38)).

During Joram’s reign, strained relations between Israel and the Arameans led to incursions by Aramean raiders into the northern kingdom (see [6:8](https://ref.ly/2Kgs6:8), [24](https://ref.ly/2Kgs6:24)).

The lavish gifts and the royal letter of introduction, common practices in the ancient Near East, underscored Naaman’s wealth, his value to the Aramean king, and Elisha’s reputation. Unlike Ahaziah, who sent his messengers directly to the temple of Baal\-zebub in Philistia ([1:2](https://ref.ly/2Kgs1:2)), the Aramean king followed diplomatic protocol by sending Naaman first to King Joram.

tore his clothes: This action was often a sign of intense agitation ([11:4](https://ref.ly/2Kgs11:4)), grief ([Gen 37:34](https://ref.ly/Gen37:34); [2 Sam 13:31](https://ref.ly/2Sam13:31)), or sorrow ([2 Kgs 6:30](https://ref.ly/2Kgs6:30); [Job 1:20](https://ref.ly/Job1:20); [2:12](https://ref.ly/Job2:12)). Due to the perennial distrust and hostilities between the Arameans and the Israelites, Joram assumed that the Aramean king was trying to pick a fight, as had occurred in the days of his father Ahab ([1 Kgs 20:1–12](https://ref.ly/1Kgs20:1-1Kgs20:12)).

Rather than receiving Naaman, who came to buy his healing, Elisha left him standing at the door and communicated with him by messenger. Naaman expected special treatment befitting his station and was disappointed both in Elisha’s failure to receive him and at his instructions to wash … seven times in the Jordan River*,* which he considered inferior to the rivers of Aram. Washing in the Jordan would be a visible reminder that only Yahweh, the God of Israel, could heal Naaman.

Naaman swallowed his pride. He did as the man of God had instructed him and experienced God’s healing power. Obedience to God brings God’s blessings and purity ([Ps 119:9–11](https://ref.ly/Ps119:9-Ps119:11)).

The road to Beth\-haggan led southward along the eastern edge of the Jezreel Valley, past Ibleam and on to Samaria. • Megiddo … he died there: King Ahaziah escaped to Samaria, where he was captured and brought to Jehu ([2 Chr 22:8–9](https://ref.ly/2Chr22:8-2Chr22:9)). The accounts in Chronicles and Kings might be combined to show that although Ahaziah was wounded at Gur, he managed to go on to *Samaria.* Later, Jehu’s men seized him and brought him to Jehu, where he was put to death. Since the Chronicler associates Ahaziah’s capture with Jehu’s slaying of Ahab’s descendants and some of *Ahaziah’*s relatives (see [2 Kgs 10:1–17](https://ref.ly/2Kgs10:1-2Kgs10:17)), it appears that Ahaziah avoided his pursuers for a time.

The writer focuses on two important events of Jehu’s reign: his murder of all who might claim Joram’s throne ([10:1–17](https://ref.ly/2Kgs10:1-2Kgs10:17)), and his execution of the priests of Baal ([10:18–27](https://ref.ly/2Kgs10:18-2Kgs10:27)).

Jehu’s message pointing out the city’s military capacity to protect the surviving members of Ahab’s dynasty was actually a declaration of war, and the leaders of Samaria understood it as such. Jehu commanded the main armed forces of Israel, and at Jezreel he had already demonstrated his military power and ruthlessness. The leaders were paralyzed with fear and agreed to do anything Jehu instructed them to do.

The precise location of Beth\-eked is uncertain, but it was in the area of Jenin. • The reply of Ahaziah’s relatives to Jehu sealed their fate. Jehu apparently reasoned that their relation to Ahaziah, hence loosely to the house of Ahab through his daughter Athaliah, could give them some claim on the throne of Israel. In this second round of executions, Jehu again exceeded his commission to terminate Ahab’s dynasty.

Royal tolerance of such shrines in Judah had previously provoked God’s anger ([1 Kgs 14:23–26](https://ref.ly/1Kgs14:23-1Kgs14:26)) and would do so again in Joash’s day ([2 Chr 24:23–24](https://ref.ly/2Chr24:23-2Chr24:24)).

Ben\-hadad son of Hazael came to the throne of Aram in Damascus in 802 BC, reigning twenty\-two years in a declining kingdom. • Adad\-nirari III of Assyria inflicted heavy losses against the Arameans (805–802 BC), allowing King Jehoash of Israel to further decimate this enemy. Fulfilling Elisha’s prophecy, Israel defeated Ben\-hadad on three occasions and so recovered the Israelite towns. Jehoash’s limited success provided a springboard for Jeroboam II’s full\-scale victories over the Arameans ([14:25](https://ref.ly/2Kgs14:25)).

While Amaziah’s basic spiritual evaluation was satisfactory, he did not serve the Lord wholeheartedly as his ancestor David had ([2 Chr 25:2](https://ref.ly/2Chr25:2)).

The attack against Judah may have occurred to force Judah into the alliance or to replace the Judean king with one of their own choosing ([Isa 7:3–6](https://ref.ly/Isa7:3-Isa7:6)).

Judah paid a heavy price in loss of freedom because of Ahaz’s trust in the Assyrian king’s military intervention on their behalf ([2 Kgs 16:7–8](https://ref.ly/2Kgs16:7-2Kgs16:8), [10](https://ref.ly/2Kgs16:10)).

The rest of the events in Ahaz’s reign: In further rejection of the Lord, Ahaz removed the utensils from the Temple “and broke them into pieces” ([2 Chr 28:24](https://ref.ly/2Chr28:24)). He then closed the Temple and discontinued services there, instead promoting paganism throughout the land ([2 Chr 28:25](https://ref.ly/2Chr28:25); [29:7](https://ref.ly/2Chr29:7)). In redefining the worship of Judah so completely, his apostasy was similar to that of Jeroboam I (cp. [2 Kgs 3:3](https://ref.ly/2Kgs3:3); [13:2](https://ref.ly/2Kgs13:2); [16:2–4](https://ref.ly/2Kgs16:2-2Kgs16:4); [17:21](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:21); [1 Kgs 12:25–33](https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:25-1Kgs12:33); [16:26](https://ref.ly/1Kgs16:26); [22:52](https://ref.ly/1Kgs22:52))

Hoshea … began to rule over Israel in 732 BC. • Hoshea’s reign is listed as beginning in “the twentieth year of Jotham” ([15:30](https://ref.ly/2Kgs15:30)) and in the twelfth year of King Ahaz’s reign in Judah. Ahaz apparently co\-reigned with Jotham from about 743 BC, when he was twelve years old, but Ahaz’s official regnal years were calculated from 731 BC ([16:2](https://ref.ly/2Kgs16:2)). Thus the references to Ahaz’s reign are in harmony.

King Shalmaneser V succeeded his father Tiglath\-pileser III in 726 BC. Hoshea may have reasoned that this leadership change would allow Israel to become independent of Assyrian vassalage. But his withholding of the annual tribute simply invited Shalmaneser’s reprisal. • by asking King So of Egypt: Some scholars understand the name *So* as an abbreviation of Pharaoh Osorkon IV (730–715 BC). Others equate *So* with Pharaoh Piankhy (747–716 BC), viewing the biblical name *So* as a Hebraic rendering of one of the names in Piankhy’s titulary. Still others suggest that *So* refers to the city of *Sais,* the capital of Pharaoh Tefnakht (727–720 BC). Whatever the identity of this king, it is clear that Hoshea’s hope for help from Egypt was misplaced.

the king of Assyria: Although sources identify Samaria’s conqueror as Shalmaneser V of Assyria (726–722 BC), Sargon II (who ruled Assyria 721–705 BC) claimed that he captured the city. Perhaps Sargon was the field commander when Samaria fell and then became king when Shalmaneser died during the year of the siege. • invaded the entire land: Assyrian military strategy was to devastate the territory surrounding an enemy’s primary city before launching a final attack. • The ninth year of King Hoshea’s reign was 722 BC. • the people … were exiled: The Assyrians practiced deportation in order to defuse future rebellions. Sargon also brought other people to Israel to form a mixed population ([17:24–25](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:24-2Kgs17:25)). • Halah was situated northeast of Nineveh in Assyria. • The Habor River is a tributary of the Euphrates River in northwestern Assyria. • Gozan was located on the Habor River northeast of Haran ([Gen 12:4](https://ref.ly/Gen12:4)). Assyrian documents from the area list personal names that are clearly Israelite, perhaps reflecting the deportation of the people of Samaria.

Sennacherib’s second message reminded the people of Jerusalem of the Assyrians’ ruthless victories; it was common knowledge that the kings of Assyria had plundered, tortured, mutilated (see [19:28](https://ref.ly/2Kgs19:28)), and completely destroyed everyone who stood in their way. No nation, king, or god had been able to resist them. In the face of this threat, the people would be wiser to trust their common sense and surrender rather than trust Hezekiah and his deceptive piety.

The horse was used in sun worship in the ancient Near East. The Assyrian sun\-god Shamash and other deities were depicted riding across the sky in horse\-drawn chariots. Archaeological evidence suggests that a solar cult existed in Israel as early as the 800s BC. The cult’s popularity likely increased during the reigns of Manasseh and Amon, when it was sponsored by the crown ([21:3–5](https://ref.ly/2Kgs21:3-2Kgs21:5), [21–22](https://ref.ly/2Kgs21:21-2Kgs21:22)).

In 609 BC, Pharaoh Neco was en route to the Euphrates River to help the king of Assyria in fighting the Babylonians at Haran, when Josiah met him at Megiddo. After the death of Assyrian king Ashurbanipal in 626 BC, Assyrian cities began falling to Nabopolassar (626–605 BC), king of the rising neo\-Babylonian power. Nabopolassar captured Nineveh, the capital of Assyria, in 612 BC. The Assyrian forces fled to Haran, where the Babylonians defeated them in 609 BC. Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon (605–562 BC) later defeated the remaining Assyrians at Carchemish in 605 BC, the same year in which he first invaded Judah (see [24:1](https://ref.ly/2Kgs24:1)).

While he campaigned in the west, his father, Nabopolassar, died, and Nebuchadnezzar returned home to assume the throne as Nebuchadnezzar II (605–562 BC). When he rejoined his troops, they easily moved down the Mediterranean coast. Sometime during this campaign, he invaded the land of Judah and took much plunder and many captives to Babylon, including Daniel and his three friends ([Dan 1:1–7](https://ref.ly/Dan1:1-Dan1:7)).

Zedekiah’s reign of eleven years in Jerusalem (597–586 BC) mirrored Jehoiakim’s evil reign ([23:36–37](https://ref.ly/2Kgs23:36-2Kgs23:37)).

Nevertheless, like earlier kings ([2 Kgs 17:4](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:4); [24:1–3](https://ref.ly/2Kgs24:1-2Kgs24:3)), Zedekiah learned that Egypt would be of little help (cp.

## 2 Kings 25:23–24 (id: 14668)

Because Gedaliah came from a family experienced in civic affairs, his governorship was initially well accepted (see also [Jer 40:1–12](https://ref.ly/Jer40:1-Jer40:12)). A seal impression recovered from Lachish confirms Gedaliah’s importance as the officer “over the house” (see study note on 1 Kgs 4:6). • In addition to the army commanders*,* the prophet Jeremiah also went to Mizpah to support Gedaliah ([Jer 40:6](https://ref.ly/Jer40:6)). This *Mizpah* was a border town in Benjamin; it had been prominent in Israelite history as a place of religious assembly ([1 Sam 7:5–6](https://ref.ly/1Sam7:5-1Sam7:6)). • The men listed here held important posts. Ishmael was from a prominent family of royal lineage ([2 Kgs 25:25](https://ref.ly/2Kgs25:25); [Jer 36:12](https://ref.ly/Jer36:12)). Johanan served Gedaliah faithfully ([Jer 40:13–16](https://ref.ly/Jer40:13-Jer40:16)). The name Jezaniah occurs on materials recovered from excavations at Tell\-en\-Nasbeh.

Gedaliah had been warned that Ishmael was plotting to assassinate him but was unconvinced ([Jer 40:13–16](https://ref.ly/Jer40:13-Jer40:16)); his trust cost him his life. Ishmael also killed many Judeans and Babylonians*,* fled with many captives, and escaped to Ammon ([Jer 41:4–15](https://ref.ly/Jer41:4-Jer41:15)).

Then all the people of Judah*,* led by Johanan, fled in panic to Egypt against Jeremiah’s counsel (see [Jer 42:1–43:7](https://ref.ly/Jer42:1-Jer43:7)).

Evil\-merodach (Babylonian, *Amel\-marduk*, “man of Marduk”) succeeded Nebuchadnezzar II at his death and reigned a short time (561–560 BC). • He was kind to Jehoiachin: Babylonian annals give details of the rations Jehoiachin received in prison. The narrator’s mention of Jehoiachin living in gracious circumstances is perhaps intended to provide hope that God would preserve and restore a repentant people to their land (see [1 Kgs 8:46–53](https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:46-1Kgs8:53); [Isa 35:8–10](https://ref.ly/Isa35:8-Isa35:10); [51:11](https://ref.ly/Isa51:11); [Jer 29:10–14](https://ref.ly/Jer29:10-Jer29:14); [Zeph 3:20](https://ref.ly/Zeph3:20)).
