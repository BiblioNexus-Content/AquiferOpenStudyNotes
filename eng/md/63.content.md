## 2 John 1:1 (id: 14423)

This letter is from John, the elder: The translators have added *John* for clarification; John refers to himself as *the elder* to affirm his authority in the church. • to the chosen lady (Greek kuria) and to her children: The Greek word kuria could be the name of a specific individual; more likely, it refers to a particular local church and its believers (cp. [1:13](https://ref.ly/2John1:13)). • whom I love in the truth: This either means “truly love” (see [1:5–6](https://ref.ly/2John1:5-2John1:6)) or, more likely, it refers to love between those who profess the same truth about Christ in contrast to the lies of the false teachers ([1:7](https://ref.ly/2John1:7); see [1 Jn 2:21–23](https://ref.ly/1John2:21-1John2:23)). John emphasizes the pronoun *I* to contrast sharply with the lovelessness of the false teachers, who rejected the true church.

* **Associated Passages:** 2JN 1:1

## 2 John 1:1–3 (id: 14419)

John begins with a standard introduction for a personal letter. • John mentions truth four times in this brief introduction and once in [1:4](https://ref.ly/2John1:4). John wanted his readers to know and live out the truths about Jesus Christ and their relationship with him and not to be led astray by false teachers.

* **Associated Passages:** 2JN 1:1–2JN 1:3

## 2 John 1:2 (id: 14424)

Christian love is rooted in knowing the truth. The truth that lives in us is more than just facts or doctrine; it is the presence of God (see [John 14:15–17](https://ref.ly/John14:15-John14:17)), who will be with us forever.

* **Associated Passages:** 2JN 1:2

## 2 John 1:3 (id: 14425)

Grace, mercy, and peace are blessings of which John is confident for those who live in truth and love*,* and who demonstrate by their actions that they are God’s children.

* **Associated Passages:** 2JN 1:3

## 2 John 1:4–11 (id: 14426)

John now applies the truth and love that he mentioned in the introduction ([1:1–3](https://ref.ly/2John1:1-2John1:3)) to the readers’ situation. Living in truth and love means maintaining fellowship with true Christians ([1:4–6](https://ref.ly/2John1:4-2John1:6)), but also discerning false teachers and refusing to listen to them or help them ([1:7–11](https://ref.ly/2John1:7-2John1:11)).

* **Associated Passages:** 2JN 1:4–2JN 1:11

## 2 John 1:5 (id: 14427)

I am writing to remind you, dear friends: Literally *I urge you, lady.* See study note on 1:1.

* **Associated Passages:** 2JN 1:5

## 2 John 1:7 (id: 14428)

many deceivers have gone out into the world: Docetists were denying that Jesus Christ came in a real body. John refuted this heresy in his first letter (see [1 Jn 4:2–3](https://ref.ly/1John4:2-1John4:3)). • A false teacher is a deceiver*,* because they mislead unwary believers, and an antichrist*,* because they distract and lead people away from the true Christ. By using the apocalyptic symbol of the antichrist, John signals the severity of the heresy and the ultimate judgment upon false teachers.

* **Associated Passages:** 2JN 1:7

## 2 John 1:8 (id: 14429)

we: This word refers to the apostles and their co\-workers. The apostles taught the truth and defended it against heresies, and believers (referred to as you) are admonished to protect their faith from teaching that could destroy them ([1:9](https://ref.ly/2John1:9)).

* **Associated Passages:** 2JN 1:8

## 2 John 1:9 (id: 14430)

Anyone who wanders away from this teaching (literally *everyone going beyond and not remaining in the teaching*): To *go beyond* is to contradict the apostolic teachings about Jesus Christ and believe things about Jesus that were not taught by the apostles. This is a warning to the church not to listen to the false teachers.

* **Associated Passages:** 2JN 1:9

## 2 John 1:10–11 (id: 14420)

Believers should not invite that person*,* who does not teach the truth about Christ, into their homes. The early churches met in homes (see [Acts 2:46](https://ref.ly/Acts2:46); [5:42](https://ref.ly/Acts5:42); [8:3](https://ref.ly/Acts8:3); [12:5](https://ref.ly/Acts12:5), [12](https://ref.ly/Acts12:12); [Col 4:15](https://ref.ly/Col4:15); [Phlm 1:2](https://ref.ly/Phlm1:2)), so this could refer to inviting false teachers to a meeting of the church. It could also refer to giving any form of hospitality to false teachers, which would help their mission. The only way to deal with them was to not accept them into the fellowship.

* **Associated Passages:** 2JN 1:10–2JN 1:11

## 2 John 1:12 (id: 14421)

Our English idiom face to face has the same meaning as the Greek idiom used here (literally *mouth to mouth;* see also [3 Jn 1:14](https://ref.ly/3John1:14)). • Then our joy will be complete: Our relationship with Christ is not merely a private experience; we experience the fullest joy in harmonious fellowship with other believers.

* **Associated Passages:** 2JN 1:12

## 2 John 1:13 (id: 14422)

from the children of your sister: This probably refers to the sister church in Ephesus and its members, with whom John was staying (see [1:1](https://ref.ly/2John1:1)). John lived in that region and cared for several churches.

* **Associated Passages:** 2JN 1:13
