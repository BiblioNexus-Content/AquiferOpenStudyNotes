## Judges 1:1 (id: 19696)

The request for divine guidance (see [Exodus 28:30](https://ref.ly/Exod28:30); [Numbers 27:21](https://ref.ly/Num27:21); [1 Samuel 14:41](https://ref.ly/1Sam14:41); [28:6](https://ref.ly/1Sam28:6); compare [Joshua 7:14](https://ref.ly/Josh7:14)) reminds us that the Lord's covenant with Israel included taking the land.

## Judges 1:1–2.5 (id: 19687)

The first prologue talks about how the tribes did not follow Joshua's farewell instructions ([Joshua 23](https://ref.ly/Josh23:1-Josh23:16)).

## Judges 1:1–3.6 (id: 19688)

Two introductions ([Judges 1:1–2:5](https://ref.ly/Judg1:1-Judg2:5) and [2:6–3:6](https://ref.ly/Judg2:6-Judg3:6)) come before the main part of the book. Both start with Joshua's death ([Judges 1:1](https://ref.ly/Judg1:1); see also [2:8](https://ref.ly/Judg2:8)), linking Judges to the earlier story ([Joshua 24:29–33](https://ref.ly/Josh24:29-Josh24:33); compare [Joshua 1:1](https://ref.ly/Josh1:1); [2 Samuel 1:1](https://ref.ly/2Sam1:1)).

## Judges 1:2 (id: 19704)

This verse, also found in the epilogues ([Judges 20:18](https://ref.ly/Judg20:18)), highlights Judah's importance. This tribe did not participate in the judges' decline (compare [Judges 15:9–13](https://ref.ly/Judg15:9-Judg15:13)) after Othniel, the ideal judge connected to Judah through Caleb ([Joshua 14:6](https://ref.ly/Josh14:6); [15:13](https://ref.ly/Josh15:13), [17](https://ref.ly/Josh15:17)).

* The tribe of Simeon almost vanished within the territory given to Judah ([Joshua 19:1](https://ref.ly/Josh19:1)).
* *fight against the Canaanites...go with you to your territory*: See [Joshua 16:10](https://ref.ly/Josh16:10); [17:13](https://ref.ly/Josh17:13); [23:4–13](https://ref.ly/Josh23:4-Josh23:13).

## Judges 1:10 (id: 19689)

Hebron was the city closest to Abraham's home by the oaks of Mamre ([Genesis 13:18](https://ref.ly/Gen13:18)). The patriarchs later lived and were buried there ([Genesis 23:19](https://ref.ly/Gen23:19); [35:27](https://ref.ly/Gen35:27); [49:29–32](https://ref.ly/Gen49:29-Gen49:32)). It was originally called Kiriath\-arba, meaning "City of Arba," named after the legendary Arba, who was a great hero of the descendants of Anak and Anak's ancestor ([Joshua 14:15](https://ref.ly/Josh14:15); [15:13](https://ref.ly/Josh15:13)). The Anakites are identified with the feared Nephilites ([Numbers 13:33](https://ref.ly/Num13:33); see [Genesis 6:4](https://ref.ly/Gen6:4)).

* **Associated Passages:** JDG 1:10

## Judges 1:11 (id: 19690)

Debir (formerly known as Kiriath\-sepher) (literally *City of the Book*): This was a major Anakite town in the hill country ([Joshua 11:21](https://ref.ly/Josh11:21)). Its exact location is uncertain, but it is traditionally thought to be either southwest or east of Hebron.

## Judges 1:16 (id: 19692)

The Kenites were a southern desert tribe linked to Moses' in\-laws, also known as Midianites ([Exodus 18:1](https://ref.ly/Exod18:1); [Numbers 10:29](https://ref.ly/Num10:29)). Moses invited them to share in the covenant blessing ([Numbers 10:29–32](https://ref.ly/Num10:29-Num10:32)). At least one Kenite clan accepted the offer and joined Judah. However, members of the clan later supported King Jabin of Hazor ([Judges 4:11](https://ref.ly/Judg4:11), [17](https://ref.ly/Judg4:17)).

* **Associated Passages:** JDG 1:16

* *devoted the city to destruction*: See [Leviticus 27:28–29](https://ref.ly/Lev27:28-Lev27:29).
* *Hormah*: See study note on Numbers 21:2–3.

* **Associated Articles:** Numbers 21:2-3 (ID: 22771)

## Judges 1:18 (id: 19694)

Gaza, Ashkelon, and Ekron, along with Gath and Ashdod, later became the five main cities of the Philistines ([Judges 3:3](https://ref.ly/Judg3:3)).

* **Associated Passages:** JDG 1:18
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Judges 1:19–20 (id: 19695)

Even with the Lord's presence, they did not finish the conquest due to iron chariots and disobedience (see [Joshua 23:12–13](https://ref.ly/Josh23:12-Josh23:13); [24:14](https://ref.ly/Josh24:14)).

* **Associated Passages:** JDG 1:19–JDG 1:20
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Judges 1:21 (id: 19698)

* The tribe of Benjamin produced many heroes, like Ehud and Saul, but it also showed great unfaithfulness to the covenant, unlike Judah (see [Judges 20:18](https://ref.ly/Judg20:18)). Like Judah in its first battle ([Judges 1:4–8](https://ref.ly/Judg1:4-Judg1:8)), Benjamin faced strong people in a large city but chose to share the city with them. There is no mention of the Lord's presence (compare [Judges 1:19](https://ref.ly/Judg1:19), [22](https://ref.ly/Judg1:22)). The Jebusite city stayed under Canaanite control until David's time.
* The phrase "to this day" highlights either ongoing historical situations (here and [Judges 6:24](https://ref.ly/Judg6:24)) or the continuation of certain customs to a later time ([1:26](https://ref.ly/Judg1:26); [10:4](https://ref.ly/Judg10:4); [15:19](https://ref.ly/Judg15:19); [18:12](https://ref.ly/Judg18:12)).

* **Associated Passages:** JDG 1:21
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Judges 1:21–36 (id: 19697)

The tribes of Israel did not keep the covenant. Their complacency was rebellion against the Lord, as shown in the rest of the book of Judges.

* **Associated Passages:** JDG 1:21–JDG 1:36
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Judges 1:22 (id: 19700)

* The Lord supported the descendants of Joseph (the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh) only when they attacked Bethel together. Bethel was a sacred place for the Israelites since Jacob's time ([Genesis 28:19](https://ref.ly/Gen28:19)). They failed when they attacked separately ([Judges 1:27–29](https://ref.ly/Judg1:27-Judg1:29)).
* Bethel is linked to the battle against Ai ([Joshua 7:2](https://ref.ly/Josh7:2)) and is mentioned in the list of kings that Israel defeated ([Joshua 12:16](https://ref.ly/Josh12:16)).

* **Associated Passages:** JDG 1:22
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Judges 1:22–36 (id: 19699)

Mentions of Joseph's descendants ([Judges 1:22](https://ref.ly/Judg1:22), [35](https://ref.ly/Judg1:35)) highlight the northern tribes' failures to remove their enemies.

* **Associated Passages:** JDG 1:22–JDG 1:36
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Judges 1:24 (id: 19701)

To show mercy (Hebrew *khesed*) suggests making a covenant (See also [Judges 8:35](https://ref.ly/Judg8:35), "kindness").

* **Associated Passages:** JDG 1:24
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Judges 1:26 (id: 19702)

The land of the Hittites likely referred to North Syria, not the Hittite Kingdom in Anatolia (modern\-day Turkey). We know nothing about the new Luz.

* **Associated Passages:** JDG 1:26
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Judges 1:27 (id: 19703)

This group of Canaanite cities extended from Dor on the Mediterranean to Beth\-shan in the Jordan Valley. It effectively separated the northern tribes from those south of the Jezreel Valley. Similarly, several cities listed in the south ([Judges 1:35](https://ref.ly/Judg1:35)) likely separated Judah from the northern tribes.

* **Associated Passages:** JDG 1:27
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Judges 1:34 (id: 19705)

Dan's failure to take the land shows complete unfaithfulness and led to abandoning part of the promised land ([Judges 17–18](https://ref.ly/Judg17:1-Judg18:31)).

* **Associated Passages:** JDG 1:34
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Judges 2:1 (id: 19843)

Even when Israel was unfaithful, God's promise to Abraham stayed unconditional ([Genesis 12:1–3](https://ref.ly/Gen12:1-Gen12:3); [17:1–22](https://ref.ly/Gen17:1-Gen17:22); compare [2 Timothy 2:13](https://ref.ly/2Tim2:13)).

* **Associated Passages:** JDG 2:1
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Judges 2:1–5 (id: 19837)

The sanctuary was established at Gilgal ([Joshua 4:19û20](https://ref.ly/Josh4:19-Josh4:20); [5:10](https://ref.ly/Josh5:10)). Bokim is an unknown location where an angel of the Lord made an announcement. This announcement caused weeping and an attempt to reverse the judgment by offering a sacrifice.

* **Associated Passages:** JDG 2:1–JDG 2:5
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Judges 2:2 (id: 19845)

The gods of other nations were not neutral. Destroying pagan altars was essential for following the covenant. Failing to do so would lead to social and religious compromise, and the people of the land would oppress Israel (see [Deuteronomy 20:17–18](https://ref.ly/Deut20:17-Deut20:18)).

* **Associated Passages:** JDG 2:2
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Judges 2:6–3.6 (id: 19846)

The second prologue continues from the events of [Joshua 23–24](https://ref.ly/Josh23:1-Josh24:33) (see study note on Judges 1:1–3:6). It introduces a third generation ([Judges 2:10](https://ref.ly/Judg2:10)) who did not personally witness the Lord’s mighty acts.

* **Associated Passages:** JDG 2:6–JDG 3:6
* **Associated Articles:** Judges 1:1-3.6 (ID: 19688)

## Judges 2:8 (id: 19847)

Compare [Judges 1:1;](https://ref.ly/Judg1:1) [Joshua 24:29–31](https://ref.ly/Josh24:29-Josh24:31).

* **Associated Passages:** JDG 2:8
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Judges 2:10–19 (id: 19838)

Joshua had died, and the new generation had not seen God's saving power. The Canaanites still lived in the land. This led to a cycle of rebellion and partial restoration. This section introduces that cycle, which the main part of the book shows.

* **Associated Passages:** JDG 2:10–JDG 2:19
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Judges 2:11–13 (id: 19839)

* Israel turned away from the Lord and started worshiping the gods of nearby nations, especially the Canaanite gods Baal and Asherah.
* Baal means “lord”; Ashtoreth may be a Hebrew version of the Canaanite goddess “Astarte,” who had different forms. See also [Judges 6:25–32](https://ref.ly/Judg6:25-Judg6:32) and Judges 6:25–32.

* **Associated Passages:** JDG 2:11–JDG 2:13
* **Associated Articles:** Judges 6:25-32 (ID: 19934)

## Judges 2:14–15 (id: 19840)

When Israel worshipped other gods, God withdrew his support. Their rebellion led to military defeat and great distress from their enemies.

* **Associated Passages:** JDG 2:14–JDG 2:15
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Judges 2:15 (id: 19841)

God was not just absent; he played an active role in Israel's defeat. The Lord determined the battle's outcome (see [2 Chronicles 20:15](https://ref.ly/2Chr20:15)).

* **Associated Passages:** JDG 2:15
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Judges 2:16–19 (id: 19842)

The Lord appointed judges who led to some temporary recovery. People later described them as "judging" Israel (for example, [Judges 3:10](https://ref.ly/Judg3:10); [4:4](https://ref.ly/Judg4:4); [10:2–3](https://ref.ly/Judg10:2-Judg10:3)), but they were mainly famous for their military successes.

* **Associated Passages:** JDG 2:16–JDG 2:19
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Judges 2:20–23 (id: 19844)

The remaining Canaanites and their religion tempted the Israelites, offering an alternative to following the Lord and his covenant. God knew and even planned this outcome (compare [Judges 3:4](https://ref.ly/Judg3:4)), but he does not set his people up to sin ([James 1:12–15](https://ref.ly/Jas1:12-Jas1:15)). Temptations are everywhere, but the choice to obey God or give in to temptation is up to those who claim to know him. Israel had a duty to fully possess the land, but God, not humans, decides victory or failure.

* **Associated Passages:** JDG 2:20–JDG 2:23
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Judges 3:1–4 (id: 19874)

The Philistines and Canaanites stayed in the land to teach important lessons. People needed warfare skills to survive in ancient times. God let these enemies stay to train and help Israel.

* **Associated Passages:** JDG 3:1–JDG 3:4
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Judges 3:3 (id: 19887)

* The Philistines were not listed with the native Canaanite tribes. They were sea invaders who settled on Israel's southwest coast around 1200 BC. The Philistines had five cities, each with its own ruler (see [1 Samuel 6:16–17](https://ref.ly/1Sam6:16-1Sam6:17)). They are mentioned with the Canaanites because they became Israel's main enemy from Samson's time onward.
* The text includes Sidonians and northern Hivites to show that Israel's ideal borders were far north and east of what they actually controlled.
* The Hivites were Canaanite (Hamitic) people ([Genesis 10:17](https://ref.ly/Gen10:17)). Little is known about them. The Gibeonites, who tricked Joshua ([Joshua 9:3–27](https://ref.ly/Josh9:3-Josh9:27)), were Hivites.
* Baal\-hermon is possibly the largest of the three peaks of Mount Hermon in Israel's northeast corner. Lebo\-hamath, in southern Lebanon, marks Israel's northernmost ideal boundary ([1 Kings 8:65](https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:65)).

* **Associated Passages:** JDG 3:3
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Judges 3:5–6 (id: 19888)

Israel did not pass God's test ([Judges 3:1–4](https://ref.ly/Judg3:1-Judg3:4)). Marrying people from other groups led Israel to worship the fertility gods of the Canaanites.

* **Associated Passages:** JDG 3:5–JDG 3:6
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Judges 3:7–11 (id: 19889)

The story of Othniel is a typical example of the cycles in Judges. People did wrong, often worshipping Baal and Asherah (see study notes on Judges 2:11–13; 6:25–32). This angered the Lord and led to foreign oppression. The people's cries moved God to show compassion and send a rescuer\-judge through his spirit. The rescuer stopped the oppression, and the land experienced peace before the cycle repeated. Othniel represents an ideal judge.

## Judges 3:8 (id: 19890)

* Cushan\-rishathaim means “Cushan of Double Wickedness.”
* Aram\-naharaim means “Aram of the Two Rivers.” This name likely refers to the area between the Euphrates and Balih Rivers in Mesopotamia. It may also mean Mesopotamia, which translates to “Midst of the Two Rivers,” the area between the Tigris and the Euphrates.

* **Associated Passages:** JDG 3:8

## Judges 3:12–13 (id: 19875)

* The people of Moab and the Ammonites descended from Lot’s relationship with his daughters ([Genesis 19:30–38](https://ref.ly/Gen19:30-Gen19:38)). Although related to Israel, both nations were Israel’s enemies.
* The Amalekites were nomads who attacked Israel in the desert, and Israel was commanded to remain hostile toward them ([Numbers 24:20](https://ref.ly/Num24:20); [Deuteronomy 25:17–19](https://ref.ly/Deut25:17-Deut25:19)). These three nations likely joined forces because they feared Israel's expansion.

## Judges 3:12–30 (id: 19876)

In this epic story of intrigue and cleverness, Ehud showed bravery when a group of nations from east of the Jordan invaded the hill country of Ephraim and Benjamin. The story uses a familiar pattern and emphasizes the people's repeated turning away from their faith.

* **Associated Passages:** JDG 3:12–JDG 3:30
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Judges 3:15 (id: 19877)

* *left\-handed* (literally *restricted in the right hand*): This trait allowed Ehud to hide his weapon on his right hip. The Greek Old Testament translates this phrase as “ambidextrous.” The term is linked to the tribe of Benjamin (“son of my right hand,” [Genesis 35:18](https://ref.ly/Gen35:18); see [Judges 20:16](https://ref.ly/Judg20:16)) and is associated with heroic military skills (compare [1 Chronicles 12:1–2](https://ref.ly/1Chr12:1-1Chr12:2)).
* The tribute money was either pieces of metal or, more likely, agricultural goods that needed a team of bearers ([Judges 3:18](https://ref.ly/Judg3:18)).

Gilgal became the Israelites' first base after they crossed the Jordan River. It was the site of key events during their conquest ([Joshua 4–6](https://ref.ly/Josh4:1-Josh6:27)). The stone idols might have been a pagan shrine made from the twelve stones Joshua set up ([Joshua 4:20](https://ref.ly/Josh4:20)). Later, Gilgal remained an important center for both the faithful ([1 Samuel 7:16](https://ref.ly/1Sam7:16)) and idol worshippers ([Hosea 4:15](https://ref.ly/Hos4:15); [9:15](https://ref.ly/Hos9:15); [12:11](https://ref.ly/Hos12:11); [Amos 4:4](https://ref.ly/Amos4:4); [5:5](https://ref.ly/Amos5:5)).

The message needed to be secret so Ehud could be alone with the king. It had to be from God to make sure the plan worked. Eglon likely stood up because he expected a message from the Lord, which he did receive.

* Shamgar is not specifically identified as an Israelite or a judge (see [Judges 5:6–7](https://ref.ly/Judg5:6-Judg5:7)).
* *Son of Anath*: Anath might have been a Canaanite goddess or shrine (compare [Judges 1:33](https://ref.ly/Judg1:33), “Beth\-anath”). Some ancient texts suggest he was part of a Canaanite warrior class.

## Judges 4:1–5.31 (id: 19891)

The story of Deborah and Barak, found in both prose ([Judges 4](https://ref.ly/Judg4:1-Judg4:24)) and poetry ([Judges 5](https://ref.ly/Judg5:1-Judg5:31)), describes a major military operation against a significant Canaanite enemy after the initial conquest. Another king named Jabin, who also ruled in Hazor, was defeated earlier by Joshua along with a large northern alliance, and Hazor was burned (see [Joshua 11:1–15](https://ref.ly/Josh11:1-Josh11:15)). Although [Joshua 11](https://ref.ly/Josh11:1-Josh11:23) and [Judges 4–5](https://ref.ly/Judg4:1-Judg5:31) are often compared, they have too many differences to be considered accounts of the same battle. Instead, Jabin is likely a dynastic name; it appears in the Mari texts for an even earlier king of Hazor, around 1800 BC.

* **Associated Passages:** JDG 4:1–JDG 5:31
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Judges 4:2 (id: 19902)

* Hazor, located north of the Sea of Galilee, controlled major trade routes running north\-south and east\-west. Ancient Near Eastern documents often mention Hazor, and archaeologists have extensively excavated the site. History and archaeology confirm its role as a former "the head of all these kingdoms" ([Joshua 11:10](https://ref.ly/Josh11:10)).
* *Harosheth\-hagoyim (*literally "Forest or Farmland of the Nations") might have been a staging area for the battle; its location and history are debated.

## Judges 4:4–7 (id: 19904)

Deborah was a prophet (Hebrew *’ishah nebi’a*, meaning a female prophet), who served as a judge (*shoptah*, a feminine verb; see study note on Judges 2:16–19). She is the main character in this story, although much of the action involves her assistant, Barak. Unlike most characters in the book of Judges, Deborah acted as both a judge and a military leader. As a prophet, she predicted Samuel's later work ([1 Samuel 7:15–17](https://ref.ly/1Sam7:15-1Sam7:17)). Deborah called for a holy war where the Lord would fight for his people ([Judges 4:6–7](https://ref.ly/Judg4:6-Judg4:7); see study notes on Deuteronomy 1:30; 2 Chronicles 20:20–21).

## Judges 4:6 (id: 19905)

* Although Barak is listed as an Israelite hero ([Hebrews 11:32](https://ref.ly/Heb11:32)), the Book of Judges gives him equal status with Deborah.

This song, a victory hymn usually credited to Deborah, offers a poetic version of the battle, adding details to the prose account. It is one of the oldest Hebrew poems. It praises the Lord, the tribes who joined the fight, and Jael. It curses those who stayed home, Sisera, and his mother's followers. It contrasts life before Barak's victory, when the Lord's curse was on the land, with the blessings after the warriors' righteous acts. It ends with a prayer that the Lord's enemies will perish like Sisera ([Judges 5:31](https://ref.ly/Judg5:31)).

The fire and earthquake that terrified Israel during the giving of the law (see [Exodus 19:18](https://ref.ly/Exod19:18)) symbolize God's power and anger on the battlefield against his enemies.

The Lord does not need a large army to save his people (compare [1 Samuel 14:6](https://ref.ly/1Sam14:6)). A large army might have hindered success because surprise was crucial to the Lord’s plan. Gideon reduced the army to keep humility, not for military strategy.

Ephraim, the leading tribe of the north\-central hill country, produced only a minor judge named Tola ([Judges 10:1](https://ref.ly/Judg10:1)).

When there was peace in the land (see study note on Judges 3:7–11) before Abimelech, it lasted for periods of twenty years ([3:11](https://ref.ly/Judg3:11), [30](https://ref.ly/Judg3:30); [5:31](https://ref.ly/Judg5:31)). After Gideon, these periods became shorter. Israel's ongoing disobedience led to more social instability (compare [Judges 17–21](https://ref.ly/Judg17:1-Judg21:25)).

* Gideon's ephod ([Judges 8:27](https://ref.ly/Judg8:27)) quickly became part of a pagan shrine honoring images of the Canaanite god Baal, here called *Baal\-berith* ("Baal of the covenant"). This sinful act involved forgetting the Lord and his works and being disloyal to godly leadership. Remembering is essential to biblical, covenantal worship, from the time of the exodus ([Exodus 12:14](https://ref.ly/Exod12:14), [24](https://ref.ly/Exod12:24)) to the ongoing Christian celebration of the Lord’s Supper ([1 Corinthians 11:25](https://ref.ly/1Cor11:25)).

Each of the five minor judges (see also [Isaiah 12:8–15](https://ref.ly/Judg12:8-Judg12:15)) led Israel for a set number of years. During this time after Gideon, the phrase *the land had rest for forty years* ([Judges 3:11](https://ref.ly/Judg3:11), [30](https://ref.ly/Judg3:30); [5:31](https://ref.ly/Judg5:31); [8:28](https://ref.ly/Judg8:28)) does not appear again. The details about these mysterious figures include their birthplaces and burial sites, and sometimes a brief family history or notable family traits. Four of the five names are found in other family records: 

* Tola and Puah are clans of Issachar ([Genesis 46:13](https://ref.ly/Gen46:13); [Numbers 26:23](https://ref.ly/Num26:23))
* Elon is a descendant of Zebulun ([Genesis 46:14](https://ref.ly/Gen46:14); [Numbers 26:26](https://ref.ly/Num26:26))
* Jair is mentioned in several places (see [Numbers 32:41](https://ref.ly/Num32:41); [Deuteronomy 3:14](https://ref.ly/Deut3:14); [Joshua 13:30](https://ref.ly/Josh13:30); [1 Kings 4:13](https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:13))

The Lord responded to his people's complete abandonment by allowing severe oppression ([Judges 10:8](https://ref.ly/Judg10:8)).

Normally, Israel's cry led to divine help, but God's choice to leave them to their chosen gods marks a change in the cycle described in [Judges 2:10–19](https://ref.ly/Judg2:10-Judg2:19).

Even his victory lasted only six years ([Judges 12:7](https://ref.ly/Judg12:7)). This period of decline increased the need for a king.

They had promised ([Judges 10:18](https://ref.ly/Judg10:18)) that whoever led the attack against the Ammonites would become the ruler.

* The ceremony at Mizpah, in the presence of the Lord, seems to have been a suzerain\-vassal covenant. In this agreement, a ruler (the suzerain) promises to protect and defend a vassal people in exchange for authority over them (see study note on Exodus 20:1–23:33; see also Deuteronomy Book Introduction, “Literary Form”).

* Jephthah first tried to solve the issue through diplomacy instead of using military force (compare [Deuteronomy 20:10–11](https://ref.ly/Deut20:10-Deut20:11)).
* Unlike the nomadic and raiding Midianites from Gideon's time, the Ammonites were a settled tribe. Their land was east of Israel's territory in Transjordan (east of the Jordan River), with Rabbah as their capital. The Ammonites, like the Moabites (both who were descended from Lot) and the Edomites (descendants of Esau), were to be left alone because the Lord assigned their territories to them ([Deuteronomy 2:16–23](https://ref.ly/Deut2:16-Deut2:23)).
* Contrary to the Ammonite king's claim, the Amorites, not the Ammonites or Moabites, lived between the Arnon and Jabbok rivers during the conquest. When Sihon refused to let Israel pass, the Lord gave the land of the Amorite kings Sihon and Og to Israel. The Ammonite king had no valid reason to argue with Israel.

Chemosh was the god of the Moabites.

Sihon, king of the Amorites, had taken this land from Moab earlier ([Numbers 21:24](https://ref.ly/Num21:24)).

The Lord never requires bargaining for his favor.

Before battles, people usually offered priestly sacrifices ([1 Samuel 13:8–12](https://ref.ly/1Sam13:8-1Sam13:12)).

Jephthah made a hasty promise and then blamed his daughter for the outcome. He did not consider the guidance of Scripture. Vows were usually unbreakable ([Numbers 30:2](https://ref.ly/Num30:2)), but the Old Testament allows exceptions for unwise vows ([Numbers 30:6–8](https://ref.ly/Num30:6-Num30:8)). Since the law forbade human sacrifice, he could have offered a substitute ([Leviticus 27:1–8](https://ref.ly/Lev27:1-Lev27:8)). Jephthah likely did not know these laws, possibly due to his upbringing far from Israel's main centers.

Jephthah fulfilled his vow by sacrificing his daughter. There is no proof he only kept her celibate (compare [Judges 11:37](https://ref.ly/Judg11:37)). Jephthah’s foolishness shows how much Israel's society had fallen into lawlessness and turning away from their faith.

The Philistines, mentioned earlier ([Judges 3:3](https://ref.ly/Judg3:3); [10:7](https://ref.ly/Judg10:7)), were newcomers to Canaan, later called Palestine. This warlike group of sea people had Greek, not Canaanite, roots. They settled in the southwestern coastal areas around 1200 BC. From then on, Philistia became Israel’s natural enemy and increasingly threatened its national existence. Israel developed institutions like kingship partly to respond to the Philistine threat.

However, [Judges 13:8](https://ref.ly/Judg13:8) shows that Manoah felt a strong personal duty to raise the child. The angel responded kindly but emphasized the wife's responsibility.

Manoah would only let a visitor leave after offering a meal, following eastern hospitality customs. The angel insisted that any food be given as a sacrifice to the Lord. This, along with his reluctance to eat (compare with Gideon’s visitor, [Judges 6:17–22](https://ref.ly/Judg6:17-Judg6:22)), suggests this was a *theophany* (an appearance of God). Until then, Manoah had not recognized his visitor's divine nature.

The cycle of revenge was complex (see [Judges 9:7–21](https://ref.ly/Judg9:7-Judg9:21)). First, Samson sought revenge on the Philistine community, not his in\-laws. Then, the Philistines recognized Samson as a victim of injustice (see study note on Judges 14:20) and retaliated against his in\-laws. This prompted Samson to avenge his in\-laws by attacking the Philistines. This series of events nearly led to a war with Israel.

* *household idols*: Compare [Genesis 31:19–32](https://ref.ly/Gen31:19-Gen31:32); [2 Kings 23:24](https://ref.ly/2Kgs23:24); [Zechariah 10:2](https://ref.ly/Zech10:2). The Bible criticizes the powerlessness of these personal gods. Micah making his son his personal priest was very unusual: The father was supposed to lead the family's religious activities ([Deuteronomy 6:7](https://ref.ly/Deut6:7); [Job 1:5](https://ref.ly/Job1:5)), only Aaron's descendants could be priests ([Exodus 28:1–29:37](https://ref.ly/Exod28:1-Exod29:37); [30:30–33](https://ref.ly/Exod30:30-Exod30:33); [40:12–15](https://ref.ly/Exod40:12-Exod40:15)), and priests served all of Israel, not just one family.

## Judges 17:7–8 (id: 19799)

This Levite does not fit typical biblical categories. Some Levites were priests, while others served in the temple (compare [Numbers 3–4](https://ref.ly/Num3:1-Num4:49)). Levites lived throughout Israel ([Genesis 49:5–7](https://ref.ly/Gen49:5-Gen49:7); [Joshua 21](https://ref.ly/Josh21:1-Josh21:45)). This young man, likely a descendant of Gershom ([Judges 18:30](https://ref.ly/Judg18:30); see [Exodus 2:21–22](https://ref.ly/Exod2:21-Exod2:22)), lived in Judah but not in a Levitical town. He was searching for a new place to live.

## Judges 17:13 (id: 19794)

In Micah’s view, hiring a priest made the shrine seem more legitimate. However, he believed the Lord would bless him due to superstition, not obedience. Micah’s disregard for God’s covenant would lead to a curse that no unemployed Levite could prevent. Micah was not the last Israelite to seek a priest or Levite to legitimize improper religious practices (compare [1 Kings 12:28–31](https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:28-1Kgs12:31); [2 Kings 16:10–18](https://ref.ly/2Kgs16:10-2Kgs16:18)).

The migration of the Danites (compare [Joshua 19:40–48](https://ref.ly/Josh19:40-Josh19:48)) shows the tribe's failure to follow God's covenant and reflects Israel's decline. Micah's personal heresy ([Judges 17:4–5](https://ref.ly/Judg17:4-Judg17:5)) grew into the apostasy of the entire tribe ([18:30–31](https://ref.ly/Judg18:30-Judg18:31)). The initial covenant failure ([Judges 17:19–36](https://ref.ly/Judg1:19-Judg1:36)) led to social breakdown during the time of Jephthah and Samson ([Judges 11–16](https://ref.ly/Judg11:1-Judg16:31)). Eventually, law and order gave way to banditry and pillaging ([Judges 18:27–28](https://ref.ly/Judg18:27-Judg18:28)).

*Zorah and Eshtaol*: Scouts came from the area where the Spirit of the Lord first moved Samson ([Judges 13:25](https://ref.ly/Judg13:25)). The mention of these two towns reminds us that Samson's mission was unfinished, either by his tribe, Dan, or their powerful neighbor, Judah. Instead of fighting the Lord’s battles, these skilled warriors bullied fellow Israelites ([Judges 18:24–25](https://ref.ly/Judg18:24-Judg18:25)) and attacked a defenseless city ([18:27](https://ref.ly/Judg18:27); compare [Genesis 49:17](https://ref.ly/Gen49:17)).

The Danites either recognized the young Levite's accent (*voice*), which was from the region of Judah ([Judges 17:7](https://ref.ly/Judg17:7)), or they knew him personally. Their questions were not just about his credentials; they also sought some divine guidance ([Judges 18:5](https://ref.ly/Judg18:5)). His reply ([Judges 18:6](https://ref.ly/Judg18:6)) showed he was willing to be a mercenary priest.

Now they sought God's blessing from a hired priest. This priest's "blessing," like Micah's mother's ([Judges 17:2](https://ref.ly/Judg17:2)), sounded religious but had no basis in Israel's covenant with the Lord.

Laish has been thoroughly excavated and was an impressive city at that time. The description of Laish and its connection to the port of Sidon is not entirely clear in the text or historical records.

Joshua and Caleb overcame their fear and acted with faith by remembering the Lord’s promise (compare [Joshua 2:9](https://ref.ly/Josh2:9), [24](https://ref.ly/Josh2:24); [6:2](https://ref.ly/Josh6:2); [10:19](https://ref.ly/Josh10:19), [30](https://ref.ly/Josh10:30)). The Danite warriors asked for God’s blessing and saw the land's value, but their overconfidence contrasts with the strong faith of Joshua and Caleb.

Beth\-rehob might have been an Aramean kingdom to the north ([2 Samuel 10:6](https://ref.ly/2Sam10:6)). The Danite warriors captured this defenseless city without heroism or a holy war. Dan fulfilled Jacob’s mixed blessing by abandoning the high calling of governing his people ([Genesis 49:16](https://ref.ly/Gen49:16)). Instead, they became *a snake by the road, a viper in the path that bites the horse’s heels so that its rider tumbles backward* ([Genesis 49:17](https://ref.ly/Gen49:17)).

The city of Dan became the northernmost point of Israel's territory (for example, [Judges 20:1](https://ref.ly/Judg20:1); [2 Samuel 3:10](https://ref.ly/2Sam3:10); [1 Kings 4:25](https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:25); [2 Chronicles 30:5](https://ref.ly/2Chr30:5)). It remained a center of idol worship throughout its history (see [1 Kings 12:28–30](https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:28-1Kgs12:30); [Amos 8:14](https://ref.ly/Amos8:14)).

* The tribe of Dan continued its religious unfaithfulness at least through the time of the judges. It is not clear if Samuel, Saul, or David corrected this.
* Joshua used Shiloh, a town in the hill country of Ephraim, as his command post and main shrine ([Joshua 18:1](https://ref.ly/Josh18:1)) during the conquest and distribution of the land ([Joshua 18–22](https://ref.ly/Josh18:1-Josh22:34)). The priest Eli and his sons served the Lord at Shiloh ([1 Samuel 1:3](https://ref.ly/1Sam1:3)). The Philistines likely destroyed the town and sanctuary around 1050 BC (see [1 Samuel 4:1–11](https://ref.ly/1Sam4:1-1Sam4:11)). Later, people remembered Shiloh as an example of God's judgment on false worship done in his name (see [Jeremiah 7:12–14](https://ref.ly/Jer7:12-Jer7:14); [26:6](https://ref.ly/Jer26:6); compare [Psalm 78:60](https://ref.ly/Ps78:60)).

A concubine was a second\-class wife. In societies where polygamy was common, people could buy a concubine, acquire one as debt repayment, or take one in war. Sometimes, a concubine was added to compensate for a deficiency in a legitimate wife (for example, [Genesis 16:1–4](https://ref.ly/Gen16:1-Gen16:4); [30:3–13](https://ref.ly/Gen30:3-Gen30:13); [35:22](https://ref.ly/Gen35:22)).

## Judges 19:1–21.25 (id: 19822)

* This second epilogue (see study note on Judges 17:1–21:25) shifts the focus from individuals to entire tribes. It begins with the outrage in the Benjamite town of Gibeah ([Judges 19](https://ref.ly/Judg19:1-Judg19:30)), which led to a civil war ([Judges 20](https://ref.ly/Judg20:1-Judg20:48)) and the near destruction of Benjamin. It then moves to the attempt to save the tribe from disappearing ([Judges 21](https://ref.ly/Judg21:1-Judg21:25)). The book ends with the familiar refrain: *In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes*. This was what they did *in the days of Gibea*, perhaps the lowest point in Israel's history that Hosea, 400 years later, would compare to the depths Ephraim had reached ([Hosea 9:9](https://ref.ly/Hos9:9); [10:9](https://ref.ly/Hos10:9)).
* The path was cleared for a shift from charismatic leadership to "covenant\-charismatic kingship." This kingship combined living under the Lord’s covenant with the anointing of the spirit for ruling, as seen with Saul and David.

The Levite had money and supplies ([Judges 19:19](https://ref.ly/Judg19:19)), so there was even less reason not to help.
