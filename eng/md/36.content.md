## Zephaniah 1:1 (id: 26155)

The Lord gave this message: Zephaniah was a prophet, God’s spokesman. • Hezekiah probably indicates the king of that name (see [2 Kgs 18:1–20:20](https://ref.ly/2Kgs18:1-2Kgs20:20)).

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 1:1

## Zephaniah 1:1–2.3 (id: 26149)

Zephaniah’s message from the Lord warns about worldwide judgment ([1:1–6](https://ref.ly/Zeph1:1-Zeph1:6)) and exhorts his readers to repent ([1:7–13](https://ref.ly/Zeph1:7-Zeph1:13)) before the devastation overtakes them ([1:14–18](https://ref.ly/Zeph1:14-Zeph1:18)) and to seek the Lord and live righteously and humbly before him in the hope that they may be spared his judgment ([2:1–3](https://ref.ly/Zeph2:1-Zeph2:3)).

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 1:1–ZEP 2:3

## Zephaniah 1:2–3 (id: 26156)

The list of the things that God will sweep away in his judgment is in reverse order to their creation ([Gen 1:20–26](https://ref.ly/Gen1:20-Gen1:26)): people and animals . . . birds . . . fish*,* because judgment is a reversal of creation.

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 1:2–ZEP 1:3

## Zephaniah 1:4 (id: 26158)

When Zephaniah made this prophecy, before Josiah’s reforms in 622 BC, idolatrous priests rampantly promoted Baal worship and other forms of paganism ([2 Kgs 23:5](https://ref.ly/2Kgs23:5)).

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 1:4

## Zephaniah 1:4–6 (id: 26157)

Having pronounced judgment on the whole earth ([1:2–3](https://ref.ly/Zeph1:2-Zeph1:3)), Zephaniah now focuses attention on his own people, Judah and Jerusalem.

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 1:4–ZEP 1:6

## Zephaniah 1:5 (id: 26159)

Scripture denounced the practice of worshiping heavenly bodies such as the sun, moon, and stars (see [Deut 4:15–19](https://ref.ly/Deut4:15-Deut4:19); [2 Kgs 21:3](https://ref.ly/2Kgs21:3); [23:12](https://ref.ly/2Kgs23:12)). • Molech might refer to the Canaanite god Baal, the Ammonite god Milcom, or the pagan deity Molech. Although the law explicitly prohibited Molech worship ([Lev 20:1–5](https://ref.ly/Lev20:1-Lev20:5)), it remained a constant temptation to Israel ([2 Kgs 16:3](https://ref.ly/2Kgs16:3); [21:6](https://ref.ly/2Kgs21:6)).

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 1:5

## Zephaniah 1:7 (id: 26161)

has prepared his people for a great slaughter and has chosen their executioners: Foreigners will *slaughter* the wicked among the Lord’s people.

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 1:7

## Zephaniah 1:7–18 (id: 26160)

The entire passage must be seen as one vast event. Some aspects would be fulfilled at Jerusalem’s fall in 586 BC; others would be repeated in various historical epochs (such as the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70\) until the whole prophecy is fulfilled at the end of time when God acts fully and finally to judge the world and renew creation ([Rev 19:11–22:5](https://ref.ly/Rev19:11-Rev22:5)).

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 1:7–ZEP 1:18

## Zephaniah 1:8 (id: 26162)

The leaders and princes of Judah were the tribal chieftains of Israel ([Num 1:4](https://ref.ly/Num1:4)), court officials ([1 Chr 22:17](https://ref.ly/1Chr22:17)), district supervisors ([1 Kgs 20:14–15](https://ref.ly/1Kgs20:14-1Kgs20:15)), city officials ([Judg 8:6](https://ref.ly/Judg8:6)), military leaders ([1 Kgs 2:5](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:5); [2 Kgs 1:9–14](https://ref.ly/2Kgs1:9-2Kgs1:14); [25:23](https://ref.ly/2Kgs25:23), [26](https://ref.ly/2Kgs25:26)), or even religious leaders ([Ezra 8:24](https://ref.ly/Ezra8:24)). Their influential role put them in a position of heightened responsibility before God (cp. [Jas 3:1](https://ref.ly/Jas3:1)).

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 1:8

## Zephaniah 1:9 (id: 26163)

those who participate in pagan worship ceremonies (literally *those who leap over the threshold*): The people of Judah perpetuated the pagan custom of leaping over the threshold of a temple to avoid contact with it, in deference to that pagan god (see [1 Sam 5:1–5](https://ref.ly/1Sam5:1-1Sam5:5)).

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 1:9

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 1:15

## Zephaniah 1:17 (id: 26154)

grope around like the blind: An example of God’s justice (see also [Rom 1:21–32](https://ref.ly/Rom1:21-Rom1:32)). Because God’s people were blind ethically and spiritually (see [Exod 23:8](https://ref.ly/Exod23:8); [Rom 2:19](https://ref.ly/Rom2:19); [1 Jn 2:11](https://ref.ly/1John2:11)) and had sinned against the Lord and his commandments, they would incur the just penalties specified in God’s covenant with them ([Deut 28:28–29](https://ref.ly/Deut28:28-Deut28:29)).

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 1:17

## Zephaniah 2:1–3 (id: 26164)

In light of the horrifying spectacle he has described, Zephaniah calls on his nation to repent and humble themselves before God.

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 2:1–ZEP 2:3

## Zephaniah 2:2 (id: 26170)

Farmers threshed grain on windy hilltops. When they tossed the mixed grain and chaff in the air, the wind blew the chaff away while the heavier grain fell back to the ground. The opportunity to repent was a fleeting one.

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 2:2

## Zephaniah 2:3 (id: 26171)

all who are humble: True humility involves submission to and dependence on God ([Pss 18:25–27](https://ref.ly/Ps18:25-Ps18:27); [119:142–144](https://ref.ly/Ps119:142-Ps119:144); [Prov 15:33](https://ref.ly/Prov15:33); [18:12](https://ref.ly/Prov18:12); [22:4](https://ref.ly/Prov22:4)).

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 2:3

## Zephaniah 2:4 (id: 26174)

King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon conquered the Philistine cities of Gaza and Ashkelon . . . Ashdod and Ekron. Gaza remained deserted, but the others recovered and continued into later times. Zephaniah does not mention Gath, the fifth major Philistine city (see [1 Sam 6:17](https://ref.ly/1Sam6:17)), which had either disappeared or become unimportant by Zephaniah’s time.

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 2:4

## Zephaniah 2:4–15 (id: 26172)

Zephaniah began his pronouncements with the Philistines*,* whose kingdom lay on Judah’s west ([2:4–7](https://ref.ly/Zeph2:4-Zeph2:7)). He moved on to Moab and Ammon in the east ([2:8–11](https://ref.ly/Zeph2:8-Zeph2:11)), and finally singled out Cush (Ethiopia) to the south ([2:12](https://ref.ly/Zeph2:12)) and Assyria to the north ([2:13–15](https://ref.ly/Zeph2:13-Zeph2:15)).

Zephaniah turns his attention to the judgment of the foreign nations ([2:4–15](https://ref.ly/Zeph2:4-Zeph2:15)) before returning to the judgment of Judah and Jerusalem ([3:1–8](https://ref.ly/Zeph3:1-Zeph3:8)). He then outlines God’s plans for his purified and obedient people ([3:9–20](https://ref.ly/Zeph3:9-Zeph3:20)).

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 2:4

## Zephaniah 2:5 (id: 26175)

Old Testament scholars believe the Philistines came from the island of Crete (cp. [Ezek 25:16](https://ref.ly/Ezek25:16)).

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 2:5

## Zephaniah 2:6 (id: 26176)

pasture . . . shepherd camps and enclosures for sheep: The destruction of cities and their return to a natural state represents a severe form of punishment from God.

The Baal worshipers ([1:4](https://ref.ly/Zeph1:4)) and the Philistines would never be restored ([2:4–6](https://ref.ly/Zeph2:4-Zeph2:6); see also [Amos 1:8](https://ref.ly/Amos1:8)). By contrast, God promised to return the remnant of his people to their land, care for them, and restore them to prosperity ([Zeph 3:18–20](https://ref.ly/Zeph3:18-Zeph3:20); [Isa 11:11–16](https://ref.ly/Isa11:11-Isa11:16); [Jer 23:1–8](https://ref.ly/Jer23:1-Jer23:8); [Ezek 34:11–16](https://ref.ly/Ezek34:11-Ezek34:16), [20–31](https://ref.ly/Ezek34:20-Ezek34:31)).

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 2:7

## Zephaniah 2:8 (id: 26178)

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 2:8

## Zephaniah 2:9 (id: 26179)

The destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah serves as an example of God’s severe judgment of sin, both in the Old Testament ([Deut 29:23](https://ref.ly/Deut29:23); [Isa 1:9](https://ref.ly/Isa1:9); [Jer 23:14](https://ref.ly/Jer23:14); [Amos 4:11](https://ref.ly/Amos4:11)) and in the New Testament ([Luke 10:12](https://ref.ly/Luke10:12); [Rom 9:29](https://ref.ly/Rom9:29); [2 Pet 2:6](https://ref.ly/2Pet2:6)). • salt pits: A ruinous waste ([Deut 29:23](https://ref.ly/Deut29:23); [Ps 107:34](https://ref.ly/Ps107:34); [Jer 17:6](https://ref.ly/Jer17:6)). Sowing the earth with salt was a mark of permanent judgment (see [Judg 9:45](https://ref.ly/Judg9:45)) because it made the ground barren.

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 2:9

## Zephaniah 2:11 (id: 26165)

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 2:11

## Zephaniah 2:12 (id: 26166)

## Zephaniah 2:13 (id: 26167)

Zephaniah turns from the south ([2:12](https://ref.ly/Zeph2:12)) to the north. Like Nahum before him, he announces the imminent demise of Assyria.

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 2:13

## Zephaniah 2:14 (id: 26168)

To drive home his point about Nineveh’s fate, Zephaniah invokes powerful imagery: Rubble would fill the doorways through which the wealthy and powerful of Nineveh had once walked. The eerie sounds of owls hooting in empty windows would punctuate the city’s desolation.

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 2:14

## Zephaniah 2:15 (id: 26169)

utter ruin: The doom was so certain and irreversible (see [Nah 1:14](https://ref.ly/Nah1:14); [2:13](https://ref.ly/Nah2:13); [3:19](https://ref.ly/Nah3:19)) that Zephaniah saw no future for Assyria or its capital. So complete was Nineveh’s devastation that the Greek historian Xenophon once passed by its ruins unaware that it was there. • laugh . . . shake a defiant fist: Those who suffered under Assyria’s cruel empire would be glad seeing its demise.

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 2:15

## Zephaniah 3:1 (id: 26189)

Polluted Jerusalem had wandered far from its call to be a holy city ([Isa 52:1](https://ref.ly/Isa52:1)).

get up early: Jerusalem’s citizens couldn’t wait to jump out of bed in the morning and do more evil deeds (cp. [Prov 1:16](https://ref.ly/Prov1:16)). They had moved far from the ways of their ancestor Abraham, who arose early to obey God’s command ([Gen 22:3](https://ref.ly/Gen22:3)).

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 3:7

## Zephaniah 3:8 (id: 26194)

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 3:8

## Zephaniah 3:9 (id: 26197)

God intends for the blessings promised to the faithful remnant of [3:9–13](https://ref.ly/Zeph3:9-Zeph3:13) to reach people from every nation of the world. Not just Israel, but all people would be transformed, call on the Lord (see [Isa 55:5](https://ref.ly/Isa55:5)), and serve him (see [Isa 59:19–21](https://ref.ly/Isa59:19-Isa59:21); [Zech 14:16](https://ref.ly/Zech14:16)). The spread of the Good News to all nations furthered the fulfillment of this vision ([Matt 28:19–20](https://ref.ly/Matt28:19-Matt28:20); [Rom 10:9–13](https://ref.ly/Rom10:9-Rom10:13)).
