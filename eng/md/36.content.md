## Zephaniah 1:1 (id: 26155)

The Lord gave this message: Zephaniah was a prophet, God’s spokesman. • Hezekiah probably indicates the king of that name (see [2 Kgs 18:1–20:20](https://ref.ly/2Kgs18:1-2Kgs20:20)).

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 1:1
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Zephaniah 1:1–2.3 (id: 26149)

Zephaniah’s message from the Lord warns about worldwide judgment ([1:1–6](https://ref.ly/Zeph1:1-Zeph1:6)) and exhorts his readers to repent ([1:7–13](https://ref.ly/Zeph1:7-Zeph1:13)) before the devastation overtakes them ([1:14–18](https://ref.ly/Zeph1:14-Zeph1:18)) and to seek the Lord and live righteously and humbly before him in the hope that they may be spared his judgment ([2:1–3](https://ref.ly/Zeph2:1-Zeph2:3)).

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 1:1–ZEP 2:3
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Zephaniah 1:2–3 (id: 26156)

The list of the things that God will sweep away in his judgment is in reverse order to their creation ([Gen 1:20–26](https://ref.ly/Gen1:20-Gen1:26)): people and animals … birds … fish*,* because judgment is a reversal of creation.

* **Associated Articles:** 

## Zephaniah 1:4 (id: 26158)

When Zephaniah made this prophecy, before Josiah’s reforms in 622 BC, idolatrous priests rampantly promoted Baal worship and other forms of paganism ([2 Kgs 23:5](https://ref.ly/2Kgs23:5)).

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 1:4
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Zephaniah 1:4–6 (id: 26157)

Having pronounced judgment on the whole earth ([1:2–3](https://ref.ly/Zeph1:2-Zeph1:3)), Zephaniah now focuses attention on his own people, Judah and Jerusalem.

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 1:4–ZEP 1:6
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Zephaniah 1:5 (id: 26159)

Scripture denounced the practice of worshiping heavenly bodies such as the sun, moon, and stars (see [Deut 4:15–19](https://ref.ly/Deut4:15-Deut4:19); [2 Kgs 21:3](https://ref.ly/2Kgs21:3); [23:12](https://ref.ly/2Kgs23:12)). • Molech might refer to the Canaanite god Baal, the Ammonite god Milcom, or the pagan deity Molech. Although the law explicitly prohibited Molech worship ([Lev 20:1–5](https://ref.ly/Lev20:1-Lev20:5)), it remained a constant temptation to Israel ([2 Kgs 16:3](https://ref.ly/2Kgs16:3); [21:6](https://ref.ly/2Kgs21:6)).

## Zephaniah 1:7–18 (id: 26160)

The entire passage must be seen as one vast event. Some aspects would be fulfilled at Jerusalem’s fall in 586 BC; others would be repeated in various historical epochs (such as the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70\) until the whole prophecy is fulfilled at the end of time when God acts fully and finally to judge the world and renew creation ([Rev 19:11–22:5](https://ref.ly/Rev19:11-Rev22:5)).

The leaders and princes of Judah were the tribal chieftains of Israel ([Num 1:4](https://ref.ly/Num1:4)), court officials ([1 Chr 22:17](https://ref.ly/1Chr22:17)), district supervisors ([1 Kgs 20:14–15](https://ref.ly/1Kgs20:14-1Kgs20:15)), city officials ([Judg 8:6](https://ref.ly/Judg8:6)), military leaders ([1 Kgs 2:5](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:5); [2 Kgs 1:9–14](https://ref.ly/2Kgs1:9-2Kgs1:14); [25:23](https://ref.ly/2Kgs25:23), [26](https://ref.ly/2Kgs25:26)), or even religious leaders ([Ezra 8:24](https://ref.ly/Ezra8:24)). Their influential role put them in a position of heightened responsibility before God (cp. [Jas 3:1](https://ref.ly/Jas3:1)).

those who participate in pagan worship ceremonies (literally *those who leap over the threshold*): The people of Judah perpetuated the pagan custom of leaping over the threshold of a temple to avoid contact with it, in deference to that pagan god (see [1 Sam 5:1–5](https://ref.ly/1Sam5:1-1Sam5:5)).

grope around like the blind: An example of God’s justice (see also [Rom 1:21–32](https://ref.ly/Rom1:21-Rom1:32)). Because God’s people were blind ethically and spiritually (see [Exod 23:8](https://ref.ly/Exod23:8); [Rom 2:19](https://ref.ly/Rom2:19); [1 Jn 2:11](https://ref.ly/1John2:11)) and had sinned against the Lord and his commandments, they would incur the just penalties specified in God’s covenant with them ([Deut 28:28–29](https://ref.ly/Deut28:28-Deut28:29)).

King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon conquered the Philistine cities of Gaza and Ashkelon … Ashdod and Ekron. Gaza remained deserted, but the others recovered and continued into later times. Zephaniah does not mention Gath, the fifth major Philistine city (see [1 Sam 6:17](https://ref.ly/1Sam6:17)), which had either disappeared or become unimportant by Zephaniah’s time.

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 2:4

Zephaniah began his pronouncements with the Philistines*,* whose kingdom lay on Judah’s west ([2:4–7](https://ref.ly/Zeph2:4-Zeph2:7)). He moved on to Moab and Ammon in the east ([2:8–11](https://ref.ly/Zeph2:8-Zeph2:11)), and finally singled out Cush (Ethiopia) to the south ([2:12](https://ref.ly/Zeph2:12)) and Assyria to the north ([2:13–15](https://ref.ly/Zeph2:13-Zeph2:15)).

Zephaniah turns his attention to the judgment of the foreign nations ([2:4–15](https://ref.ly/Zeph2:4-Zeph2:15)) before returning to the judgment of Judah and Jerusalem ([3:1–8](https://ref.ly/Zeph3:1-Zeph3:8)).

The Baal worshipers ([1:4](https://ref.ly/Zeph1:4)) and the Philistines would never be restored ([2:4–6](https://ref.ly/Zeph2:4-Zeph2:6); see also [Amos 1:8](https://ref.ly/Amos1:8)). By contrast, God promised to return the remnant of his people to their land, care for them, and restore them to prosperity ([Zeph 3:18–20](https://ref.ly/Zeph3:18-Zeph3:20); [Isa 11:11–16](https://ref.ly/Isa11:11-Isa11:16); [Jer 23:1–8](https://ref.ly/Jer23:1-Jer23:8); [Ezek 34:11–16](https://ref.ly/Ezek34:11-Ezek34:16), [20–31](https://ref.ly/Ezek34:20-Ezek34:31)).

## Zephaniah 2:9 (id: 26179)

The destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah serves as an example of God’s severe judgment of sin, both in the Old Testament ([Deut 29:23](https://ref.ly/Deut29:23); [Isa 1:9](https://ref.ly/Isa1:9); [Jer 23:14](https://ref.ly/Jer23:14); [Amos 4:11](https://ref.ly/Amos4:11)) and in the New Testament ([Luke 10:12](https://ref.ly/Luke10:12); [Rom 9:29](https://ref.ly/Rom9:29); [2 Pet 2:6](https://ref.ly/2Pet2:6)). • salt pits: A ruinous waste ([Deut 29:23](https://ref.ly/Deut29:23); [Ps 107:34](https://ref.ly/Ps107:34); [Jer 17:6](https://ref.ly/Jer17:6)). Sowing the earth with salt was a mark of permanent judgment (see [Judg 9:45](https://ref.ly/Judg9:45)) because it made the ground barren.

To drive home his point about Nineveh’s fate, Zephaniah invokes powerful imagery: Rubble would fill the doorways through which the wealthy and powerful of Nineveh had once walked. The eerie sounds of owls hooting in empty windows would punctuate the city’s desolation.

So complete was Nineveh’s devastation that the Greek historian Xenophon once passed by its ruins unaware that it was there. • laugh … shake a defiant fist: Those who suffered under Assyria’s cruel empire would be glad seeing its demise.

God intends for the blessings promised to the faithful remnant of [3:9–13](https://ref.ly/Zeph3:9-Zeph3:13) to reach people from every nation of the world. Not just Israel, but all people would be transformed, call on the Lord (see [Isa 55:5](https://ref.ly/Isa55:5)), and serve him (see [Isa 59:19–21](https://ref.ly/Isa59:19-Isa59:21); [Zech 14:16](https://ref.ly/Zech14:16)). The spread of the Good News to all nations furthered the fulfillment of this vision ([Matt 28:19–20](https://ref.ly/Matt28:19-Matt28:20); [Rom 10:9–13](https://ref.ly/Rom10:9-Rom10:13)).
