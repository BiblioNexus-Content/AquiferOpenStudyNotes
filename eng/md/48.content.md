## Galatians 1:1 (id: 12069)

* *Paul, an apostle*: Apostles were representatives with authority given by a church or council (for example, [2 Corinthians 8:23](https://ref.ly/2Cor8:23); [Philippians 2:25](https://ref.ly/Phil2:25)). However, the Jerusalem church did not appoint Paul as an apostle. Instead, Jesus Christ himself chose Paul, giving him Christ’s authority ([Acts 9:1–15](https://ref.ly/Acts9:1-Acts9:15); [26:12](https://ref.ly/Acts26:12-Acts26:20)[–](https://ref.ly/Acts9:1-Acts9:15)[20](https://ref.ly/Acts26:12-Acts26:20); see also [Romans 1:5](https://ref.ly/Rom1:5)). This authority was equal to that of other apostles.
* Paul said that God the Father gave him his authority as an apostle. This happened because God raised Jesus from the dead. The fact that Jesus rose from death made it possible for Paul to receive his special work from God.

* **Associated Articles:** 

## Galatians 1:1–5 (id: 12057)

In all his letters, Paul introduces himself and greets the recipients. This greeting stands out because: 

1. Paul strongly asserts his authority as an apostle ([1:1](https://ref.ly/Gal1:1)).
2. Instead of offering thanks, prayer, or praise, he gives a rebuke ([1:6](https://ref.ly/Gal1:6-Gal1:10)[–](https://ref.ly/Acts9:1-Acts9:15)[10](https://ref.ly/Gal1:6-Gal1:10)).

* **Associated Articles:** 

## Galatians 1:1–2.21 (id: 12056)

Some people were against Paul and questioned whether he was a true apostle. They did not believe he was honest and did not think he had the right to be a leader in the church. So Paul begins his letter by explaining that he really was an apostle with authority from God.

* **Associated Passages:** GAL 1:1–GAL 2:21
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Galatians 1:2 (id: 12073)

* *all the brothers with me*: Paul likely wrote from Antioch of Syria. Antioch was the center of Paul’s ministry and the first hub of Gentile Christianity (see [Acts 11:20–26](https://ref.ly/Acts11:20-Acts11:26)). Paul was not alone, although his opponents in Galatia might have suggested that, but he was in fellowship with an important New Testament church.
* Paul probably founded the churches of Galatia during his first missionary journey ([Acts 13:4–14:26](https://ref.ly/Acts13:4-Acts14:26); see Galatians Book Introduction, “Recipients”).

* **Associated Passages:** GAL 1:2
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Galatians 1:3 (id: 12075)

*Grace and peace to you from God*: This is a common greeting by Paul (see also study note on 1 Corinthians 1:3). It combines Greek and Hebrew greetings. "Grace" (Greek *charis*) is similar to "greetings" (Greek *chairein*). "Peace" reflects Hebrew *shalom*. Paul included both Jewish and non\-Jewish Christians (compare [Galatians 3:28](https://ref.ly/Gal3:28)). The Galatians risked losing God's grace and peace ([3:1–4](https://ref.ly/Gal3:1-Gal3:4); [5:1](https://ref.ly/Gal5:1-Gal5:4)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal3:1-Gal3:4)[4](https://ref.ly/Gal5:1-Gal5:4)).

* **Associated Passages:** GAL 1:3
* **Associated Articles:** 1 Corinthians 1:3 (ID: 13705)

## Galatians 1:3–5 (id: 12074)

Paul followed the common style for first\-century letters. He included a greeting, wished for well\-being, and introduced the main topic, the good news about Jesus.

* **Associated Passages:** GAL 1:3–GAL 1:5
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Galatians 1:4 (id: 12077)

* Since Jesus fully rescued us from our sins*,* we do not need to try to save ourselves.
* Christian faith rescues us from the evil world we live in (see [4:8](https://ref.ly/Gal4:8-Gal4:12)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal3:1-Gal3:4)[12](https://ref.ly/Gal4:8-Gal4:12); [5:13](https://ref.ly/Gal5:13-Gal5:26)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal3:1-Gal3:4)[26](https://ref.ly/Gal5:13-Gal5:26)).

* **Associated Passages:** GAL 1:4

## Galatians 1:4–5 (id: 12076)

This summary of the good news about Jesus is the basis for the following criticism ([1:6](https://ref.ly/Gal1:6-Gal1:10)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal3:1-Gal3:4)[10](https://ref.ly/Gal1:6-Gal1:10)). It might be a creed or statement of faith that Paul used to remind the Galatians of the message they had accepted before.

* **Associated Passages:** GAL 1:4–GAL 1:5
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Galatians 1:5 (id: 12078)

We should thank God alone for salvation because it is his work alone.

* **Associated Passages:** GAL 1:5
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Galatians 1:6 (id: 12080)

* The Galatians were *deserting* (or abandoning) God by rejecting the good news about Jesus that Paul shared. Instead, they were depending on the law. God called them to himself through Christ's loving mercy, not through the law ([2:16](https://ref.ly/Gal2:16)).
* *the One who called you*: See [1:15](https://ref.ly/Gal1:15); [Romans 8:30](https://ref.ly/Rom8:30); [9:24](https://ref.ly/Rom9:24); [11:29](https://ref.ly/Rom11:29).
* *a different gospel*: Some people taught that non\-Jewish Christians had to be circumcised to join God's family. Paul rejected any requirement other than faith in Jesus (see [Galatians 5:2–4](https://ref.ly/Gal5:2-Gal5:4)).

* **Associated Passages:** GAL 1:6
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Galatians 1:6–10 (id: 12079)

*I am amazed*: In most of his letters, Paul usually expressed gratitude and prayed for those who received his letters after his greeting (for example, [Romans 1:8–10](https://ref.ly/Rom1:8-Rom1:10); [1 Corinthians 1:4](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:4-1Cor1:5)[–](https://ref.ly/Rom1:8-Rom1:10)[5](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:4-1Cor1:5); [Philippians 1:3](https://ref.ly/Phil1:3-Phil1:6)[–](https://ref.ly/Rom1:8-Rom1:10)[6](https://ref.ly/Phil1:3-Phil1:6); [Colossians 1:3](https://ref.ly/Col1:3-Col1:5)[–](https://ref.ly/Rom1:8-Rom1:10)[5](https://ref.ly/Col1:3-Col1:5); [2 Thessalonians 1:3](https://ref.ly/2Thess1:3-2Thess1:12)[–](https://ref.ly/Rom1:8-Rom1:10)[12](https://ref.ly/2Thess1:3-2Thess1:12)). But he had nothing positive to say about the Galatian church.

* **Associated Passages:** GAL 1:6–GAL 1:10
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Galatians 1:7 (id: 12081)

* The "different gospel" ([1:6](https://ref.ly/Gal1:6)) was a distortion and not the true message of salvation. The only way to be saved is through faith in Christ. Adding any extra requirements changes the message and it is no longer the good news.
* *some people are troubling you and trying to distort the gospel of Christ*: The Judaizers (a group insisting on Jewish customs) knew they were altering the good news about Jesus to match their beliefs.

* **Associated Passages:** GAL 1:7
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Galatians 1:8–9 (id: 12082)

* *let him be under a curse!* (literally *Let that person be anathema*): The Greek word *anathema* often translates the Hebrew *kherem*, which in the Old Testament means something dedicated to God for complete destruction (see [Leviticus 27:28–29](https://ref.ly/Lev27:28-Lev27:29); compare [Romans 9:3](https://ref.ly/Rom9:3); [1 Corinthians 12:3](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:3); [16:22](https://ref.ly/1Cor16:22)). Paul called for God's strongest wrath on those who distort the good news about Jesus ([Galatians 1:7](https://ref.ly/Gal1:7)).
* *even if we or an angel from heaven*: No one is allowed to change the good news (compare [2:6–10](https://ref.ly/Gal2:6-Gal2:10), [11–14](https://ref.ly/Gal2:11-Gal2:14)).

* **Associated Passages:** GAL 1:8–GAL 1:9
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Galatians 1:9 (id: 12083)

*a gospel contrary to the one you received*: the gospel (the good news about Jesus) the Galatians had received was exactly what Paul had preached to them ([1:8](https://ref.ly/Gal1:8); compare [2 Thessalonians 2:15](https://ref.ly/2Thess2:15)).

* **Associated Passages:** GAL 1:9
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Galatians 1:10 (id: 12058)

* The tone and content of this letter show that Paul did not seek to win people's approval. The Judaizers likely criticized Paul for trying to please people by focusing only on faith and grace, not including the law, which they saw as the whole message.
* Being Christ’s servant means staying true to Christ, no matter how others react (see [Acts 5:29](https://ref.ly/Acts5:29); [Ephesians 6:5–6](https://ref.ly/Eph6:5-Eph6:6); [1 Thessalonians 2:3–6](https://ref.ly/1Thess2:3-1Thess2:6)).

* **Associated Passages:** GAL 1:10
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Galatians 1:11 (id: 12060)

*the gospel I preached*: Paul taught that people are made right with God by grace and through faith, not by following the law (see [2:16–17](https://ref.ly/Gal2:16-Gal2:17); [Romans 10:9–13](https://ref.ly/Rom10:9-Rom10:13); [Ephesians 2:8–9](https://ref.ly/Eph2:8-Eph2:9)).

* **Associated Passages:** GAL 1:11
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Galatians 1:11–2.21 (id: 12059)

The Judaizers (people who insisted on following Jewish customs) came to Galatia. They preached that both faith and circumcision were necessary. They questioned Paul's authority as an apostle and tried to discredit his message. Paul defended his authority by showing that past events proved his message was the true good news.

* **Associated Passages:** GAL 1:11–GAL 2:21
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Galatians 1:12 (id: 12061)

* *I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it*: Jewish scholars mainly relied on teachers. The Judaizers claimed Paul received his special mission and message from the other apostles, but then had unfaithfully changed the message.
* *I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ*: See [1:17](https://ref.ly/Gal1:17); [Acts 9:3–15](https://ref.ly/Acts9:3-Acts9:15); [26:12–18](https://ref.ly/Acts26:12-Acts26:18). Paul's unique experience gave him special authority and insight. However, he learned many things about Jesus's life from other people. (for example, [Galatians 1:18](https://ref.ly/Gal1:18); [1 Corinthians 11:23–26](https://ref.ly/1Cor11:23-1Cor11:26); [15:3–11](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:3-1Cor15:11)).

* **Associated Passages:** GAL 1:12
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Galatians 1:13–14 (id: 12062)

To show that his message was not from human reasoning (*devised by man*, [1:11](https://ref.ly/Gal1:11)), Paul explains his life before meeting Jesus. He was a very successful Jew (see [Acts 8:1–3](https://ref.ly/Acts8:1-Acts8:3); [22:1](https://ref.ly/Acts22:1-Acts22:5)[–](https://ref.ly/Acts8:1-Acts8:3)[5](https://ref.ly/Acts22:1-Acts22:5); [26:4](https://ref.ly/Acts26:4-Acts26:5)[–](https://ref.ly/Acts8:1-Acts8:3)[5](https://ref.ly/Acts26:4-Acts26:5); [Philippians 3:4](https://ref.ly/Phil3:4-Phil3:7)[–](https://ref.ly/Acts8:1-Acts8:3)[7](https://ref.ly/Phil3:4-Phil3:7)). His opposition to God's church and strict following of Judaism showed his belief in the law before Christ confronted him ([Galatians 1:15](https://ref.ly/Gal1:15-Gal1:16)[–](https://ref.ly/Acts8:1-Acts8:3)[16](https://ref.ly/Gal1:15-Gal1:16)).

* **Associated Passages:** GAL 1:13–GAL 1:14
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Galatians 1:14 (id: 12063)

*zealous for the traditions of my fathers:* Paul was very passionate about following the Jewish religious traditions he learned from his ancestors (see [Mark 7:6](https://ref.ly/Mark7:6-Mark7:13)[–](https://ref.ly/Acts8:1-Acts8:3)[13](https://ref.ly/Mark7:6-Mark7:13)).

* **Associated Passages:** GAL 1:14
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Galatians 1:15–16 (id: 12064)

* *God, who set me apart from my mother’s womb*:God chose Paul for special work even before he was born. This is like how God chose other leaders (see [Jeremiah 1:5](https://ref.ly/Jer1:5); [Psalm 139:13](https://ref.ly/Ps139:13-Ps139:16)[–](https://ref.ly/Acts8:1-Acts8:3)[16](https://ref.ly/Ps139:13-Ps139:16); [Isaiah 49:1](https://ref.ly/Isa49:1-Isa49:6)[–](https://ref.ly/Acts8:1-Acts8:3)[6](https://ref.ly/Isa49:1-Isa49:6); [Romans 9:10](https://ref.ly/Rom9:10-Rom9:13)[–](https://ref.ly/Acts8:1-Acts8:3)[13](https://ref.ly/Rom9:10-Rom9:13)).
* *called me by His grace:* For Paul's conversion story (how he became a follower of Jesus), see [Acts 9:1](https://ref.ly/Acts9:1-Acts9:19)[–](https://ref.ly/Acts8:1-Acts8:3)[19](https://ref.ly/Acts9:1-Acts9:19); [22:1](https://ref.ly/Acts22:1-Acts22:21)[–](https://ref.ly/Acts8:1-Acts8:3)[21](https://ref.ly/Acts22:1-Acts22:21); [26:9](https://ref.ly/Acts26:9-Acts26:23)[–](https://ref.ly/Acts8:1-Acts8:3)[23](https://ref.ly/Acts26:9-Acts26:23).
* Paul was called to share the good news about Jesus with non\-Jews ([Galatians 2:7](https://ref.ly/Gal2:7)). He even taught other apostles what this meant (see [Galatians 2:11](https://ref.ly/Gal2:11-Gal2:21)[–](https://ref.ly/Acts8:1-Acts8:3)[21](https://ref.ly/Gal2:11-Gal2:21)).
* *to reveal His Son in me*: This might refer to Paul's meeting with Christ ([Acts 9:1](https://ref.ly/Acts9:1-Acts9:19)[–](https://ref.ly/Acts8:1-Acts8:3)[19](https://ref.ly/Acts9:1-Acts9:19); see also [1 Corinthians 9:1](https://ref.ly/1Cor9:1); [15:8](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:8)). *In me* might also mean an inner revelation (see [Galatians 2:20](https://ref.ly/Gal2:20); [4:6](https://ref.ly/Gal4:6-Gal4:7)[–](https://ref.ly/Acts8:1-Acts8:3)[7](https://ref.ly/Gal4:6-Gal4:7)) and suggests that Paul's changed heart showed Christ to others.

* **Associated Articles:** 

## Galatians 1:16–20 (id: 12065)

Paul learned directly from the Lord and did not consult with any person, not even the other apostles. Paul was independent from the other apostles but still agreed with them ([2:1–10](https://ref.ly/Gal2:1-Gal2:10)).

* **Associated Passages:** GAL 1:16–GAL 1:20
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Galatians 1:17 (id: 12066)

* Paul considered his role as an apostle equal to that of the original disciples (see [1 Corinthians 9:1](https://ref.ly/1Cor9:1); [15:5–9](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:5-1Cor15:9); compare [Acts 1:22](https://ref.ly/Acts1:22); [10:41](https://ref.ly/Acts10:41)).
* Paul's journey to Arabia is not mentioned elsewhere. He likely developed his understanding of the good news about Jesus during that time. Paul was familiar with:

    + the Scriptures (see [Acts 22:3](https://ref.ly/Acts22:3)),
        + the beliefs of the first Christians (see [Acts 8:1](https://ref.ly/Acts8:1)), and
        + what others had shared with him since he became a follower of Jesus.

* **Associated Passages:** GAL 1:17
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Galatians 1:18 (id: 12068)

* *Only after three years*(or *in the third year*): This could be three years after Paul became a follower of Jesus or three years after his return from Arabia. This event is likely the visit mentioned in [Acts 9:26–30](https://ref.ly/Acts9:26-Acts9:30).
* *to confer with Cephas* (Peter): Peter had something Paul did not—personal experience with Jesus during his time on Earth.
* Paul spent fifteen days with Peter. This was not enough time for Peter to become Paul's teacher, but it gave them enough time to talk carefully about what they were teaching people about Jesus.

* **Associated Passages:** GAL 1:18
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Galatians 1:18–20 (id: 12067)

Peter and James spent fifteen days discussing Paul's message, which matched theirs. Paul did not get his authority from the Jerusalem church. His role and authority as an apostle was independent of Jerusalem.

* **Associated Passages:** GAL 1:18–GAL 1:20
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Galatians 1:20 (id: 12070)

*I assure you before God*: Paul swears before God to emphasize that his story about his trip to Jerusalem is true.

* **Associated Passages:** GAL 1:20
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Galatians 1:21–22 (id: 12071)

Paul was not working under the guidance of the apostles in Jerusalem or the churches in Judea.

* **Associated Passages:** GAL 1:21–GAL 1:22
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Galatians 1:23–24 (id: 12072)

The church in Jerusalem was very happy when Paul became a follower of Jesus. This change (compare [1:13–14](https://ref.ly/Gal1:13-Gal1:14)) and his message were both God's work (compare [Acts 9:31](https://ref.ly/Acts9:31)). The way Paul taught about Jesus matched what the Jerusalem church believed.

* **Associated Passages:** GAL 1:23–GAL 1:24
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Galatians 2:1 (id: 12097)

* Counting fourteen years from Paul's conversion ([1:15–17](https://ref.ly/Gal1:15-Gal1:17)), instead of from his previous visit ([1:18](https://ref.ly/Gal1:18)), fits well with the events in Acts.
* The Galatian Christians knew who Barnabas was. This suggests that Paul and Barnabas first shared the good news about Jesus with them during their first missionary trip together ([Acts 13:4–14:26](https://ref.ly/Acts13:4-Acts14:26); see Galatians Book Introduction, "Recipients").
* Titus was a non\-Jewish believer who worked closely with Paul to help lead and strengthen churches. For more on Titus, see the "Titus" Profile.

## Galatians 2:1–10 (id: 12084)

When Paul visited Jerusalem for the second time, the other apostles agreed that what he was teaching was correct. According to tradition, Paul was writing about the important meeting of church leaders described in [Acts 15:1–41](https://ref.ly/Acts15:1-Acts15:41). However, it is more likely that Paul was talking about his earlier visit to Jerusalem ([Acts 11:30](https://ref.ly/Acts11:30); [12:25](https://ref.ly/Acts12:25); see Galatians Book Introduction, "Date of Writing").

* **Associated Passages:** GAL 2:1–GAL 2:10
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Galatians 2:2 (id: 12100)

* If Paul's visit in [2:1–10](https://ref.ly/Gal2:1-Gal2:10) was the same visit described in [Acts 11:30](https://ref.ly/Acts11:30), then God might have shown his will through the prophet Agabus's message and the church's decision to send help during a famine ([Acts 11:27–29](https://ref.ly/Acts11:27-Acts11:29)).
* If Paul needed approval from Jerusalem's leaders, he would have met them openly. Their private meeting shows no one thought he needed public approval.
* *to those recognized as leaders*: Paul does not speak about those leaders as if they were extremely important. He probably wrote this way because false teachers were giving these leaders too much respect and honor.
* Paul shared his message with the apostles in Jerusalem, not for approval, but to ensure agreement, preventing a split between Jewish and non\-Jewish groups.
* *for fear that I was running or had already run in vain*: A division between Jewish and non\-Jewish Christians would harm the unity Christ established ([Galatians 3:28](https://ref.ly/Gal3:28)).

* **Associated Passages:** GAL 2:2
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Galatians 2:3 (id: 12101)

The apostles in Jerusalem fully agreed with Paul's message. They all believed the same good news: God's grace comes through faith in Christ, not by following the law. The Jerusalem apostles clearly did not believe that circumcision was necessary for a non\-Jew like Titus.

* **Associated Passages:** GAL 2:3
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Galatians 2:4 (id: 12103)

* Paul called some supposed believers false, saying they were not Christians. They did not understand or truly accept the good news about Jesus, unlike the apostles in Jerusalem ([2:3](https://ref.ly/Gal2:3)).
* *had come in under false pretenses*: Paul suggests that a larger group of Jewish "Christians" opposed his preaching (see [Acts 15:5](https://ref.ly/Acts15:5)) and supported the false teachers who joined the church.
* Requiring non\-Jewish Christians to follow Jewish law would trap them in rules and deny the good news of Jesus (see [Galatians 3:23–4:11](https://ref.ly/Gal3:23-Gal4:11)).

* **Associated Passages:** GAL 2:4
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Galatians 2:4–5 (id: 12102)

The false Christians entered the church in either Jerusalem or Antioch to weaken Paul's message. He taught that non\-Jews (gentiles) do not have to obey Jewish practices like circumcision.

* **Associated Passages:** GAL 2:4–GAL 2:5
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Galatians 2:5 (id: 12104)

* *We did not give in to them for a moment*: Titus was not circumcised ([2:3](https://ref.ly/Gal2:3)). Paul did not require circumcision for non\-Jewish Christians.
* *so that the truth of the gospel would remain with you*: The false teaching would ruin the good news about Jesus by adding extra requirements and questioning the effectiveness of Jesus's death and God’s grace (compare [2:11–21](https://ref.ly/Gal2:11-Gal2:21)).

* **Associated Passages:** GAL 2:5
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Galatians 2:6 (id: 12106)

* The apostles in Jerusalem were seen as great leaders because they knew Jesus during his time on Earth. However, this did not give them more authority than Paul. What mattered most was Jesus personally choosing them (see [1 Corinthians 9:1](https://ref.ly/1Cor9:1); compare [2 Corinthians 12:11–12](https://ref.ly/2Cor12:11-2Cor12:12)).
* *God does not show favoritism*: The Judaizers (a group insisting on Jewish customs) likely thought the Jerusalem apostles' direct connection to Jesus was an advantage. Paul argues that favoritism is not in God's character (compare [Leviticus 19:15–16](https://ref.ly/Lev19:15-Lev19:16); [Deuteronomy 1:17](https://ref.ly/Deut1:17); [2 Chronicles 19:7](https://ref.ly/2Chr19:7); [Job 13:10](https://ref.ly/Job13:10); [Psalms 82:1](https://ref.ly/Ps82:1-Ps82:2)[–](https://ref.ly/Lev19:15-Lev19:16)[2](https://ref.ly/Ps82:1-Ps82:2); [Proverbs 18:5](https://ref.ly/Prov18:5); [Malachi 2:8](https://ref.ly/Mal2:8-Mal2:9)[–](https://ref.ly/Lev19:15-Lev19:16)[9](https://ref.ly/Mal2:8-Mal2:9)).

* **Associated Passages:** GAL 2:6
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Galatians 2:6–10 (id: 12105)

Paul's message agreed with the Jerusalem apostles, but their approval did not give Paul his authority ([1:12](https://ref.ly/Gal1:12), [16](https://ref.ly/Gal1:16-Gal1:20)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal1:16-Gal1:20)[20](https://ref.ly/Gal1:16-Gal1:20)).

## Galatians 2:7–8 (id: 12107)

The apostles in Jerusalem noticed that Paul and Peter focused on different groups in their ministry:

* Peter mainly taught Jewish people ([Acts 1:1–5:42](https://ref.ly/Acts1:1-Acts5:42); [9:1–10:48](https://ref.ly/Acts9:1-Acts10:48)).
* Paul mainly taught non\-Jewish people ([Acts 13:1–28:31](https://ref.ly/Acts13:1-Acts28:31)).

Even though they worked with different groups, they both taught the same good news (gospel) about Jesus.

## Galatians 2:10 (id: 12085)

When Paul talks about helping the poor, this matches the story in [Acts 11:30](https://ref.ly/Acts11:30); [12:25](https://ref.ly/Acts12:25). The Christians in Judea experienced many years of severe poverty. Paul wanted the non\-Jewish churches to help ease this hardship and create unity with the Jewish church (see [Romans 15:25–27](https://ref.ly/Rom15:25-Rom15:27); [1 Corinthians 16:1](https://ref.ly/1Cor16:1-1Cor16:4)[–](https://ref.ly/Rom15:25-Rom15:27)[4](https://ref.ly/1Cor16:1-1Cor16:4); [2 Corinthians 8:1–9:15](https://ref.ly/2Cor8:1-2Cor9:15)).

## Galatians 2:11 (id: 12087)

* *When Cephas came to Antioch*: Paul confronting Peter in the city of Antioch is not in the book of Acts, but it likely happened after Paul and Barnabas came back from their first journey to tell people about Jesus ([Acts 14:26](https://ref.ly/Acts14:26-Acts14:28)[–](https://ref.ly/Rom15:25-Rom15:27)[28](https://ref.ly/Acts14:26-Acts14:28)). Paul probably wrote this letter soon after. (The apostle Paul often used the name *Cephas* when writing about Peter in his letters. *Cephas* is an Aramaic word that means "rock" or "stone." In Greek, this same name is *Petros*, which we know in English as "Peter.")
* *he stood condemned*: Peter's actions did not match what he knew—that God accepts non\-Jews through faith, not by following the law (see [Acts 10–11](https://ref.ly/Acts10:1-Acts11:30)).
* Paul had to confront Peter directly. Paul wanted to protect the good news from being changed ([Galatians 2:21](https://ref.ly/Gal2:21)). This meant publicly showing that Peter's public action was wrong (compare [1 Timothy 5:20](https://ref.ly/1Tim5:20)).

## Galatians 2:11–21 (id: 12086)

In Antioch, Peter and others went against their own beliefs and changed the good news about Jesus. This event is not mentioned in the book of Acts. Paul corrected Peter, showing that Paul's role as an apostle was independent of Jerusalem and true to the good news about Jesus.

## Galatians 2:12 (id: 12088)

* Peter ate with the non\-Jewish believers because God had shown him it was right ([Acts 10:9](https://ref.ly/Acts10:9-Acts10:16)[–](https://ref.ly/Rom15:25-Rom15:27)[16](https://ref.ly/Acts10:9-Acts10:16), [34](https://ref.ly/Acts10:34-Acts10:35)[–](https://ref.ly/Rom15:25-Rom15:27)[35](https://ref.ly/Acts10:34-Acts10:35)).
* James's friends wanted to stop Jewish and non\-Jewish believers from eating and meeting together freely. These people insisted that everyone should follow strict Jewish religious customs. They tried to force non\-Jewish believers to follow Jewish rules about food and religious practices.
* *he used to eat with the Gentiles. But when they arrived, he began to draw back and separate himself*: When Peter refused to share meals and the Lord’s Supper (see [1 Corinthians 11:20](https://ref.ly/1Cor11:20-1Cor11:22)[–](https://ref.ly/Rom15:25-Rom15:27)[22](https://ref.ly/1Cor11:20-1Cor11:22), [33](https://ref.ly/1Cor11:33-1Cor11:34)[–](https://ref.ly/Rom15:25-Rom15:27)[34](https://ref.ly/1Cor11:33-1Cor11:34)) with fellow Christians, he created a divide between Jewish and gentile (non\-Jewish) Christians. This suggested that Jewish customs made them more acceptable to God. If not uncorrected, Peter’s actions would have weakened the message of salvation by grace through faith.
* *for fear of those in the circumcision group*: James's friends pressured Peter so much that he became afraid. This was surprising because earlier, when people criticized Peter for the same thing, he had stood up to them bravely and spoke strong words to defend his actions ([Acts 11:2](https://ref.ly/Acts11:2-Acts11:18)[–](https://ref.ly/Rom15:25-Rom15:27)[18](https://ref.ly/Acts11:2-Acts11:18)). 
  
Peter might have had two reasons for his actions. First, he might have worried that his actions would make it harder for Jewish people to accept Jesus. Second, he might have been worried about the safety of Jewish Christians in Judea, who were being treated badly by non\-Christian Jews (compare [5:11](https://ref.ly/Gal5:11); [6:12](https://ref.ly/Gal6:12)). But even if Peter had good reasons, what he did was still wrong.

## Galatians 2:13 (id: 12089)

When Peter acted like a hypocrite, he led other Jewish believers to make the same mistake. They started acting as if people needed to follow Jewish customs to be accepted by God, which went against the good news about Jesus.

## Galatians 2:14 (id: 12091)

* By living like a gentile (eating with non\-Jewish people and not following Jewish food laws) Peter showed that God accepts gentiles equally with Jews through faith in Christ (see [Acts 10:34–43](https://ref.ly/Acts10:34-Acts10:43); [11:17–18](https://ref.ly/Acts11:17-Acts11:18)).
* *how can you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews?*Both Jews and gentiles would understand this from Peter’s actions.

## Galatians 2:14–21 (id: 12090)

* When Peter and the other Jewish believers stopped eating with non\-Jewish believers, they were sending the wrong message. Their actions suggested that believing in Jesus was not enough and that people also needed to follow Jewish laws to be truly accepted by God. Paul strongly argues against this. He explained that we are made right with God only through his kindness (grace) when we believe in Jesus ([Ephesians 2:8–9](https://ref.ly/Eph2:8-Eph2:9)).
* We cannot tell exactly where Paul's public words to Peter end and his message to the Galatians begins (see study note on Galatians 2:16). When Paul corrected Peter, he was also correcting the Galatians (see [3:1](https://ref.ly/Gal3:1)).

## Galatians 2:15 (id: 12092)

Gentiles were considered "sinners" because they did not have the law and could not obey God's commands. Paul used Jewish thinking categories (compare [Matthew 15:21–28](https://ref.ly/Matt15:21-Matt15:28); [26:45](https://ref.ly/Matt26:45); [Luke 6:32](https://ref.ly/Luke6:32-Luke6:34)[–](https://ref.ly/Matt15:21-Matt15:28)[34](https://ref.ly/Luke6:32-Luke6:34); [18:9](https://ref.ly/Luke18:9-Luke18:14)[–](https://ref.ly/Matt15:21-Matt15:28)[14](https://ref.ly/Luke18:9-Luke18:14)) with strong irony, emphasizing that everyone is sinful ([Galatians 2:16](https://ref.ly/Gal2:16); [Romans 3:23](https://ref.ly/Rom3:23)).

* **Associated Passages:** GAL 2:15

## Galatians 2:16 (id: 12093)

Both Jews and non\-Jews are sinners. The good news requires everyone to admit their sins (see [Romans 2:1](https://ref.ly/Rom2:1-Rom2:5)[–](https://ref.ly/Matt15:21-Matt15:28)[5](https://ref.ly/Rom2:1-Rom2:5); [3:1](https://ref.ly/Rom3:1-Rom3:20)[–](https://ref.ly/Matt15:21-Matt15:28)[20](https://ref.ly/Rom3:1-Rom3:20)) and seek God's grace ([Romans 3:21–26](https://ref.ly/Rom3:21-Rom3:26)). Peter later showed he agreed with this message ([Acts 15:7](https://ref.ly/Acts15:7-Acts15:11)[–](https://ref.ly/Matt15:21-Matt15:28)[11](https://ref.ly/Acts15:7-Acts15:11)).

Some false teachers were spreading false ideas about Paul's good news. They likely argued that if people did not have to follow the Jewish laws, they would just do whatever sinful things they wanted. Jesus would then be seen as leading people into sin ([2:17](https://ref.ly/Gal2:17)). Paul explains how this is not true. Those who trust in Jesus receive strength from the Holy Spirit to live holy lives that honor God (see [5:13](https://ref.ly/Gal5:13-Gal5:26)[–](https://ref.ly/Matt15:21-Matt15:28)[26](https://ref.ly/Gal5:13-Gal5:26)).

## Galatians 2:18 (id: 12095)

* *I prove myself to be a lawbreaker*: Abandoning faith and returning to the law places a person under the law's authority, where everyone faces God’s judgment ([Romans 3:10–12](https://ref.ly/Rom3:10-Rom3:12), [23–24](https://ref.ly/Rom3:23-Rom3:24); see [Hebrews 6:1](https://ref.ly/Heb6:1-Heb6:8)[–](https://ref.ly/Rom3:10-Rom3:12)[8](https://ref.ly/Heb6:1-Heb6:8)). This act is a serious sin against Christ ([Galatians 5:2](https://ref.ly/Gal5:2-Gal5:4)[–](https://ref.ly/Rom3:10-Rom3:12)[4](https://ref.ly/Gal5:2-Gal5:4); compare [Hebrews 6:4](https://ref.ly/Heb6:4-Heb6:6)[–](https://ref.ly/Rom3:10-Rom3:12)[6](https://ref.ly/Heb6:4-Heb6:6)). See also study note on 2:19.
* *If I rebuild*: This refers to insisting on following Jewish laws about food and circumcision ([Galatians 2:11](https://ref.ly/Gal2:11-Gal2:13)[–](https://ref.ly/Rom3:10-Rom3:12)[13](https://ref.ly/Gal2:11-Gal2:13)).
* When Jesus died on the cross, he ended the old system of religious laws that separated Jewish and non\-Jewish people from each other and from God ([Ephesians 2:14](https://ref.ly/Eph2:14-Eph2:16)[–](https://ref.ly/Rom3:10-Rom3:12)[16](https://ref.ly/Eph2:14-Eph2:16)). His death created a new way for all people to come to God through faith.

## Galatians 2:19 (id: 12096)

* *For through the law:* Trying to please God by following the law always leads to sin ([5:2–4](https://ref.ly/Gal5:2-Gal5:4); see [Rom 7:5](https://ref.ly/Rom7:5), [8](https://ref.ly/Rom7:8-Rom7:11)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal5:2-Gal5:4)[11](https://ref.ly/Rom7:8-Rom7:11)). Living by the Spirit leads away from sin ([Galatians 5:16](https://ref.ly/Gal5:16), [22](https://ref.ly/Gal5:22-Gal5:24)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal5:2-Gal5:4)[24](https://ref.ly/Gal5:22-Gal5:24)).
* *I died to the law*: "Dying to the law" means stopping the attempt to meet all its demands. Those who trust in Christ share in his death ([2:20](https://ref.ly/Gal2:20)). They are no longer judged by the law (see [Romans 6:2](https://ref.ly/Rom6:2), [10](https://ref.ly/Rom6:10-Rom6:11)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal5:2-Gal5:4)[11](https://ref.ly/Rom6:10-Rom6:11); [7:2](https://ref.ly/Rom7:2-Rom7:6)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal5:2-Gal5:4)[6](https://ref.ly/Rom7:2-Rom7:6)) and do not see the law as a way to be saved. Instead, Christians live for God in a new relationship with him through Christ ([Galatians 3:23–4:11](https://ref.ly/Gal3:23-Gal4:11); see [Romans 6:10](https://ref.ly/Rom6:10-Rom6:11)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal5:2-Gal5:4)[11](https://ref.ly/Rom6:10-Rom6:11); [14:7](https://ref.ly/Rom14:7-Rom14:8)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal5:2-Gal5:4)[8](https://ref.ly/Rom14:7-Rom14:8); [2 Corinthians 5:15](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:15)).

* Paul's good news about Jesus (that we do not need to follow Jewish laws to be saved) does not mean people will just do whatever wrong things they want ([2:17](https://ref.ly/Gal2:17)). This is because lawlessness (ignoring or disobeying God's commands) is a response of those who are not redeemed. A redeemed Christian has been crucified with Christ. See also [Colossians 2:11](https://ref.ly/Col2:11-Col2:14)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal5:2-Gal5:4)[14](https://ref.ly/Col2:11-Col2:14), [20](https://ref.ly/Col2:20-Col2:23)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal5:2-Gal5:4)[23](https://ref.ly/Col2:20-Col2:23). A Christian has left behind the old self, which tried to earn merit by following the law (compare [Romans 7:4](https://ref.ly/Rom7:4-Rom7:6)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal5:2-Gal5:4)[6](https://ref.ly/Rom7:4-Rom7:6)).
* *I no longer live, but Christ lives in m*e: Christians have experienced Christ’s death and resurrection ([Romans 6:1–14](https://ref.ly/Rom6:1-Rom6:14)). They have new hearts (see [Jeremiah 31:31](https://ref.ly/Jer31:31-Jer31:34)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal5:2-Gal5:4)[34](https://ref.ly/Jer31:31-Jer31:34); [32:38](https://ref.ly/Jer32:38-Jer32:41)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal5:2-Gal5:4)[41](https://ref.ly/Jer32:38-Jer32:41); [Ezekiel 11:19](https://ref.ly/Ezek11:19-Ezek11:20)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal5:2-Gal5:4)[20](https://ref.ly/Ezek11:19-Ezek11:20); [36:24](https://ref.ly/Ezek36:24-Ezek36:31)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal5:2-Gal5:4)[31](https://ref.ly/Ezek36:24-Ezek36:31)). These new hearts come through the Spirit's power within them (see [Romans 8:9](https://ref.ly/Rom8:9-Rom8:11)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal5:2-Gal5:4)[11](https://ref.ly/Rom8:9-Rom8:11); [Ephesians 3:16](https://ref.ly/Eph3:16-Eph3:19)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal5:2-Gal5:4)[19](https://ref.ly/Eph3:16-Eph3:19); [Colossians 1:27](https://ref.ly/Col1:27); [3:1](https://ref.ly/Col3:1-Col3:17)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal5:2-Gal5:4)[17](https://ref.ly/Col3:1-Col3:17)).
* *The life I live in the body*: Christianity does not say the body is evil or that we must leave this world to have fellowship with God. Instead, by trusting in the Son of God, we fulfill God’s purposes for our lives.
* *who loved me and gave Himself up for me**:* Christ’s self\-giving love makes new life possible ([Galatians 1:4](https://ref.ly/Gal1:4); [Romans 8:32](https://ref.ly/Rom8:32-Rom8:39)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal5:2-Gal5:4)[39](https://ref.ly/Rom8:32-Rom8:39); [2 Thessalonians 2:16](https://ref.ly/2Thess2:16-2Thess2:17)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal5:2-Gal5:4)[17](https://ref.ly/2Thess2:16-2Thess2:17)).

Paul's opponents in Galatia might have argued that his message made God's grace to Israel meaningless because it was connected to the law (see [Romans 3:12](https://ref.ly/Rom3:1-Rom3:2), [31](https://ref.ly/Rom3:31)). However, it was actually Paul’s opponents who made God's grace meaningless by denying the need for Christ's death.

* *O foolish Galatians!* Their foolishness was both intellectual and spiritual (compare [Luke 24:25](https://ref.ly/Luke24:25); see [1 Samuel 25:1–38](https://ref.ly/1Sam25:1-1Sam25:38)). They stopped trusting in Christ and trusted in the law ([Galatians 1:6](https://ref.ly/Gal1:6)).
* The Galatians were misled by the teachers’ persuasive arguments (compare [Genesis 3:1](https://ref.ly/Gen3:1-Gen3:7)[–](https://ref.ly/1Sam25:1-1Sam25:38)[7](https://ref.ly/Gen3:1-Gen3:7)). It was not actual witchcraft, but convincing words.
* *Before your very eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified*: When Paul told people about Jesus, he clearly explained how Jesus died and why his death was so important for everyone (see [Romans 10:14](https://ref.ly/Rom10:14-Rom10:17)[–](https://ref.ly/1Sam25:1-1Sam25:38)[17](https://ref.ly/Rom10:14-Rom10:17)).

This verse explains the curse Israel would experience if they did not follow all of God's commands in their covenant with him (see [Deuteronomy 27:9–26](https://ref.ly/Deut27:9-Deut27:26); compare [Deuteronomy 28:15](https://ref.ly/Deut28:15-Deut28:68)[–](https://ref.ly/Deut27:9-Deut27:26)[68](https://ref.ly/Deut28:15-Deut28:68); [31:26](https://ref.ly/Deut31:26); [Joshua 1:8](https://ref.ly/Josh1:8); [Malachi 2:2](https://ref.ly/Mal2:2); see also [Genesis 3:14](https://ref.ly/Gen3:14-Gen3:19)[–](https://ref.ly/Deut27:9-Deut27:26)[19](https://ref.ly/Gen3:14-Gen3:19); [4:10](https://ref.ly/Gen4:10-Gen4:12)[–](https://ref.ly/Deut27:9-Deut27:26)[12](https://ref.ly/Gen4:10-Gen4:12)). Sinful humans cannot fully obey God's will (see [Romans 3:9](https://ref.ly/Rom3:9-Rom3:20)[–](https://ref.ly/Deut27:9-Deut27:26)[20](https://ref.ly/Rom3:9-Rom3:20)).

## Galatians 3:10–12 (id: 12111)

The Galatians thought they needed to be circumcised to please God. By doing this, they were trying to follow all of God's laws to be accepted by him. Those who seek to be right with God through the law are under a curse. They cannot follow the entire law, so they cannot receive blessings from it.

* Scripture makes it clear, even if the Galatians or false teachers did not understand, that circumcision is not required for non\-Jewish believers.
* *"**The righteous will live by faith**"*: Paul quotes [Habakkuk 2:4](https://ref.ly/Hab2:4), in which the prophet waits in faith for God's promise to come true.

The law itself is not opposed to faith (see [3:19–25](https://ref.ly/Gal3:19-Gal3:25); [Romans 7:7](https://ref.ly/Rom7:7-Rom7:13)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal3:19-Gal3:25)[13](https://ref.ly/Rom7:7-Rom7:13)), but trying to be righteous by following the law opposes righteousness by faith in Christ. Paul quotes [Leviticus 18:5](https://ref.ly/Lev18:5) to show that life under the law of Moses requires obedience rather than *belief*. It is impossible to be accepted by God by trying to obey the law of Moses perfectly ([Galatians 3:10](https://ref.ly/Gal3:10-Gal3:11)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal3:19-Gal3:25)[11](https://ref.ly/Gal3:10-Gal3:11)).

* *"Cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree"*: Paul quotes [Deuteronomy 21:23](https://ref.ly/Deut21:23), in which criminals who were killed and had their bodies displayed in public were considered to be under God's curse (see study note on Deuteronomy 21:22). When Jesus was nailed to the cross, he took on God's curse that should have fallen on all sinners (compare [2 Corinthians 5:21](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:21)).

## Galatians 3:16 (id: 12120)

The promises to Abraham were mainly received by him and his child (literally *his seed*). This "seed" was the promised Messiah (God's chosen one), who is Abraham's ultimate descendant. The word "seed" can mean one descendant or many (see [Genesis 12:7](https://ref.ly/Gen12:7); [13:15](https://ref.ly/Gen13:15)). Although the promise can refer to many descendants (see [Galatians 3:29](https://ref.ly/Gal3:29); [Genesis 13:15](https://ref.ly/Gen13:15-Gen13:16)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal4:4-Gal4:5)[16](https://ref.ly/Gen13:15-Gen13:16); [15:5](https://ref.ly/Gen15:5-Gen15:6)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal4:4-Gal4:5)[6](https://ref.ly/Gen15:5-Gen15:6); [17:7](https://ref.ly/Gen17:7-Gen17:8)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal4:4-Gal4:5)[8](https://ref.ly/Gen17:7-Gen17:8)), it specifically points to one descendant, Christ, who fully fulfilled the promise. The heirs of the promise are not Jacob’s physical children but the spiritual children of Christ, by the Spirit through faith.

The *inheritance* cannot come from obeying the law, because that would cancel God’s promise to Abraham (see [4:1](https://ref.ly/Gal4:1-Gal4:7)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal4:4-Gal4:5)[7](https://ref.ly/Gal4:1-Gal4:7)). This promise was accepted by faith before God gave the law to Moses.

## Galatians 3:19 (id: 12124)

* If people do not receive God's inheritance through the law, why was the law given to Moses? It was to show people their sins and make it clear that sinful actions are wrongs done against God. People cannot rely on their own goodness to save them. Instead, they must trust in God (see [Romans 3:19](https://ref.ly/Rom3:19-Rom3:20)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal4:4-Gal4:5)[20](https://ref.ly/Rom3:19-Rom3:20); [4:15](https://ref.ly/Rom4:15); [5:20](https://ref.ly/Rom5:20); [7:7](https://ref.ly/Rom7:7-Rom7:13)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal4:4-Gal4:5)[13](https://ref.ly/Rom7:7-Rom7:13)).
* *until the arrival of the seed to whom the promise referred*: See [Galatians 3:16](https://ref.ly/Gal3:16). While the promise is permanent, the law of Moses was temporary. With Christ’s coming, the law was fulfilled (see [Matthew 5:17](https://ref.ly/Matt5:17-Matt5:20)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal4:4-Gal4:5)[20](https://ref.ly/Matt5:17-Matt5:20); compare [Matthew 3:13](https://ref.ly/Matt3:13-Matt3:15)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal4:4-Gal4:5)[15](https://ref.ly/Matt3:13-Matt3:15); [John 19:30](https://ref.ly/John19:30)). God's acceptance is based entirely on faith in Christ.
* *through angels*: [Deuteronomy 33:2](https://ref.ly/Deut33:2) in the Greek version (the Septuagint) describes the Lord's coming from Sinai “with myriads of holy ones, angels with him at his right hand.” See also [Psalm 68:17](https://ref.ly/Ps68:17); [Acts 7:38](https://ref.ly/Acts7:38), [53](https://ref.ly/Acts7:53); [Hebrews 2:2](https://ref.ly/Heb2:2).
* *By a mediator*: The mediator was Moses (see [Exodus 20:19](https://ref.ly/Exod20:19); [Deuteronomy 5:24](https://ref.ly/Deut5:24-Deut5:27)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal4:4-Gal4:5)[27](https://ref.ly/Deut5:24-Deut5:27)). As a mediator, Moses spoke to God for the people and spoke to the people for God.

Paul's argument might make those hearing his message think the law of Moses has no purpose. However, Paul emphasizes the law's true purpose in order to correct false teaching about the law.

## Galatians 3:20 (id: 12126)

* The law of Moses was given through angels and a mediator (Moses). The law required agreement between God and the people. The law was conditional, with blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience. In contrast, God gave his promise directly to Abraham without a mediator. It was God's promise alone, and God did not require anything in return.
* *but God is one*: Paul used the basic Jewish creed (see [Deuteronomy 6:4](https://ref.ly/Deut6:4)) to persuade non\-Jewish Christians not to convert to Judaism.

* **Associated Passages:** GAL 3:20
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Galatians 3:21 (id: 12128)

There is no conflict of purpose between law and promise or between law and faith. The law works with the promise to help people believe in Jesus. The purpose of the law is to show that people are trapped by their sins ([3:19](https://ref.ly/Gal3:19), [22](https://ref.ly/Gal3:22)). It is also meant to help people not sin ([3:23–25](https://ref.ly/Gal3:23-Gal3:25)). 

In Galatia, the Judaizers tried to convince non\-Jewish Christians that the law could do something it was never meant to do. The law was never meant to give new life and make people right with God. God does these things based on faith in his promise, which was fulfilled in Jesus Christ (see [3:22](https://ref.ly/Gal3:22)).

Because sin had imprisoned us ([3:22](https://ref.ly/Gal3:22)), the law of Moses acted as a guard, keeping God's people safe (*held in custody*) until faith in Jesus was revealed. It clearly showed God's requirements and emphasized the need for a Savior. The law also kept sin under control by clearly showing its consequences.

* *we are no longer under a guardia**n*: In Greco\-Roman culture, a child who reached adulthood was no longer under a guardian's control and could govern themselves.

They have received a part of that inheritance ([3:14](https://ref.ly/Gal3:14); [Ephesians 1:14](https://ref.ly/Eph1:14)). The Galatians acted unwisely by trying to gain access to God through circumcision ([Galatians 3:1](https://ref.ly/Gal3:1)).

* *are known by God*: God is the one who saves and has taken the initiative in understanding their souls and forgiving them freely ([Psalm 139:1](https://ref.ly/Ps139:1-Ps139:6)[–](https://ref.ly/Col2:6-Col3:11)[6](https://ref.ly/Ps139:1-Ps139:6), [23](https://ref.ly/Ps139:23-Ps139:24)[–](https://ref.ly/Col2:6-Col3:11)[24](https://ref.ly/Ps139:23-Ps139:24); [Luke 2:34](https://ref.ly/Luke2:34-Luke2:35)[–](https://ref.ly/Col2:6-Col3:11)[35](https://ref.ly/Luke2:34-Luke2:35); [Hebrews 4:12](https://ref.ly/Heb4:12)).
* By *turning back to* circumcision (as a way of being accepted by God), the Galatians would be returning to the same useless spiritual principles they knew when they worshiped false gods. Both ways of living required people to work hard to please a demanding master who was never satisfied.

Circumcision was just one way the Galatians tried to follow the law of Moses. They also started celebrating Jewish festivals. They believed this would make them more acceptable to God. To Paul, this showed they misunderstood or rejected the good news of God's grace through Jesus Christ.

*I fear for you*: The Galatians were in danger of turning away from Christ by depending on the law. If they did, Paul's efforts would have been wasted.

* *become like me*: Paul was a devoted Jew. He stopped trying to earn righteousness and accepted God's free grace in Jesus Christ. Now, Paul asks these gentiles to follow his example instead of adopting the Jewish practices he left behind. Paul's advice throughout the rest of the letter ([4:12–6:10](https://ref.ly/Gal4:12-Gal6:10)) comes from this single command.
* *You have done me no wrong:* Similarly, the Galatians should not mistreat Paul now but should continue to warmly accept his ministry and message.

* *because of an illness*: Paul might have had a long\-term health issue, but we do not know what it was (see [2 Corinthians 12:7](https://ref.ly/2Cor12:7)). Paul's condition was serious and seemed to cause problems or even upset the new church in Galatia. People often saw physical problems as a sign of God's judgment (see [John 9:1](https://ref.ly/John9:1-John9:2)[–](https://ref.ly/Col2:6-Col3:11)[2](https://ref.ly/John9:1-John9:2); [Acts 28:4](https://ref.ly/Acts28:4)). The Galatians looked beyond Paul's physical state and accepted him as God's messenger (literally angel; Greek *angelos*).

* *Those people are zealous for you**:* The Greek word here can mean have a positive meaning, like "eagerness," or a negative meaning, like "jealousy" and "envy."
* *they want to isolate you from us**:* The Judaizers (Jewish Christians insisting on following Jewish laws) might have been so eager because they envied the Galatians’ devotion to Paul and instead wanted the Galatians to be devoted to them (compare 2 Corinthians; see also [Luke 11:46–52](https://ref.ly/Luke11:46-Luke11:52)). Another possibility is that the Judaizers wanted the Galatians to depend on them as interpreters of the law of Moses.

It was good for the Galatians to continue eagerly embracing Paul and his message, even when he was not there with them. 
  
Some English Bibles translate like this: *If someone is eager to do good things for you, that’s all right; but let them do it all the time, not just when I’m with you* (New Living Translation). In this case, Paul might be saying that it was okay for others to seek the Galatians' loyalty, but those teachers were not truly trying to help them.

Bringing them to Christ was like giving birth to children and experiencing labor pains. It was difficult but rewarding. Now, Paul felt his work was not finished.
* *until Christ is formed in you**:* Paul uses the picture of giving birth to explain something important. If the Galatians continued to trust in Christ as Paul had taught them, Christ's image would grow in them (they would become more and more like Jesus in how they lived and acted). But if they chose to follow the law instead, this new life would die before it could develop. Paul says he must keep working hard, like a midwife who helps with childbirth, to make sure this does not happen.

* Paul now returns to using Scripture to support his argument. He tells the story of two of Abraham's wives, Hagar and Sarah, and their children. He uses this story to show the difference between two types of people: those who are like slaves because they try to follow all the laws, and those who are free because they belong to Christ.
* Paul uses a special way of explaining Bible stories (called allegory) that Jewish teachers used in those days (see study note on 4:24). Paul was trained as a rabbi (see [Acts 22:3](https://ref.ly/Acts22:3)) and could effectively debate the Judaizers using their own methods.

Ishmael was the son of the *slave woman*, Hagar. She was Sarah's servant (see [Genesis 16:15](https://ref.ly/Gen16:15)). Sarah gave Hagar to Abraham, trying to get the heir God promised through human efforts (see [Genesis 16:1](https://ref.ly/Gen16:1-Gen16:4)[–](https://ref.ly/Luke24:25-Luke24:27)[4](https://ref.ly/Gen16:1-Gen16:4)).

* *serve as illustrations* (literally *are being allegorized*): In allegorical writing, every character and event symbolizes a deeper meaning. Allegorical interpretations often ignore the text's historical meaning and create imaginative meanings. Here, however, Paul understood the story in its historical context and saw it as history. But he interpreted the story's characters as symbols of the current situation. Paul's opponents were also using allegorical methods, so Paul countered their flawed allegory with true allegory (see [1 Corinthians 9:22](https://ref.ly/1Cor9:22)).
* *two covenants*: The old covenant (God's special agreement with his people) was formed through Moses. The new covenant came through Jesus Christ.

Paul connects Abraham's effort to fulfill God's promises with the attempts in Galatia and other places to achieve salvation by following the law ([4:23](https://ref.ly/Gal4:23)). Hagar, as a slave woman, represents Israel's bondage under the law. This contrasts with the freedom of those who have faith in Jesus Christ ([4:26–27](https://ref.ly/Gal4:26-Gal4:27)).

* Both Hagar and Mount Sinai were symbols of Jerusalem. They represented Judaism during Paul's time. Judaism continued to trust in the law and in being Abraham's descendants for their status before God (see [John 8:31](https://ref.ly/John8:31-John8:59)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal4:26-Gal4:27)[59](https://ref.ly/John8:31-John8:59)). They rejected Jesus as Messiah and remained bound to the law ([Galatians 3:23](https://ref.ly/Gal3:23-Gal3:24)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal4:26-Gal4:27)[24](https://ref.ly/Gal3:23-Gal3:24); [4:1](https://ref.ly/Gal4:1-Gal4:3)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal4:26-Gal4:27)[3](https://ref.ly/Gal4:1-Gal4:3)).
* *Mount Sinai in Arabia*: Traditionally, Mount Sinai is located in the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt. However, some suggest that *in Arabia* means Mount Sinai was in Midian, where Moses once lived (see [Exodus 3:1](https://ref.ly/Exod3:1)).

In contrast, Sarah represents freedom in the heavenly Jerusalem, God's ideal city. Abraham’s true children by faith now live under God's rule in Jesus Christ ([3:29](https://ref.ly/Gal3:29)).
* *she is our mother:* Sarah’s son, Isaac, was freely given all of God's promises apart from the law of Moses. Similarly, Jews and gentiles who live by faith in Jesus are Sarah’s true children. They receive God's promises to Abraham freely apart from the law ([3:26](https://ref.ly/Gal3:26-Gal3:29)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal4:26-Gal4:27)[29](https://ref.ly/Gal3:26-Gal3:29); [4:4](https://ref.ly/Gal4:4-Gal4:7)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal4:26-Gal4:27)[7](https://ref.ly/Gal4:4-Gal4:7)).

The quoted passage, [Isaiah 54:1](https://ref.ly/Isa54:1), promised Israel they would thrive after the exile to Babylon. Those who have faith in Jesus Christ are Sarah’s children ([Galatians 4:26](https://ref.ly/Gal4:26)). This fulfills the promise that Sarah, who was childless, would have more children than Hagar, the slave woman. To the Judaizers (those who insisted on following Jewish law), people not following the law might seem *desolate* (spiritually barren or unfruitful), but through faith, they become abundantly fruitful as the bride of Christ ([2 Corinthians 11:2](https://ref.ly/2Cor11:2); [Ephesians 5:31](https://ref.ly/Eph5:31-Eph5:33)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal4:26-Gal4:27)[33](https://ref.ly/Eph5:31-Eph5:33)).

Isaac represents those born through God's promise (see [3:8](https://ref.ly/Gal3:8)) by the Spirit's power ([3:2](https://ref.ly/Gal3:2-Gal3:5)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal4:26-Gal4:27)[5](https://ref.ly/Gal3:2-Gal3:5); see also [Ephesians 1:13](https://ref.ly/Eph1:13-Eph1:14)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal4:26-Gal4:27)[14](https://ref.ly/Eph1:13-Eph1:14)). These people trust in God for salvation through Christ by faith. Ishmael represents those who think following the law of Moses will make them acceptable to God ([Galatians 3:10](https://ref.ly/Gal3:10-Gal3:11)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal4:26-Gal4:27)[11](https://ref.ly/Gal3:10-Gal3:11)).

Isaac was the promised child. During his weaning celebration, Ishmael treated Isaac badly (see [Genesis 21:9](https://ref.ly/Gen21:9)). Similarly, in Galatia, people who insisted on following the law were treating badly those who trusted in God's promise, the message of God's grace through faith in Jesus Christ alone (compare [Acts 13:50](https://ref.ly/Acts13:50-Acts13:51)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal4:26-Gal4:27)[51](https://ref.ly/Acts13:50-Acts13:51); [14:1](https://ref.ly/Acts14:1-Acts14:7)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal4:26-Gal4:27)[7](https://ref.ly/Acts14:1-Acts14:7)).

Sarah's demand about Ishmael in [Genesis 21:10](https://ref.ly/Gen21:10) becomes a guideline (see [Genesis 21:12](https://ref.ly/Gen21:12)) for dealing with the current son of the slave woman (anyone who refuses to abandon slavery to the law). God does not let those who try to be righteous through their own efforts share in his inheritance (see [Romans 9:30](https://ref.ly/Rom9:30-Rom9:33)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal4:26-Gal4:27)[33](https://ref.ly/Rom9:30-Rom9:33)).

* *do not be encumbered once more* (literally *do not take on a yoke*): A yoke is a heavy wooden bar that joins two farm animals together, like oxen, so they can pull heavy loads. In the Jewish tradition, people used the word "yoke" to talk about following religious laws. It was a duty and honor to "take the yoke of the law." God's children in Jesus Christ are not meant to carry this heavy burden (see [Luke 11:46](https://ref.ly/Luke11:46); [Acts 15:10](https://ref.ly/Acts15:10)).

As a Christian, Paul never preached that non\-Jews must be circumcised.
* *Why am I still being persecuted?* If Paul had been promoting a religion based on laws, the devoted Jews would not have been persecuting him everywhere he went. These leaders were angry because Paul taught that people did not need to follow the law of Moses to be saved.

*emasculate themselves* (literally *cut themselves off;* compare [Philippians 3:2](https://ref.ly/Phil3:2)): Paul uses strong words to criticize people who demanded circumcision (cutting off the foreskin from the male sex organ). 

1. Paul might refer to pagan priests in Galatia who castrated themselves (removed their testicles) for their gods. Insisting on circumcision for Christians is similar. It involved cutting the flesh to please God through physical actions instead of faith in Christ.
2. Relying on circumcision harmed the false teachers' relationship with God, so they might as well harm themselves physically.
3. In the old covenant, emasculated men could not join the congregation ([Deuteronomy 23:1](https://ref.ly/Deut23:1)). Similarly, those who depend on circumcision have no place in the new covenant community. Paul likely wished the Judaizers would *cut themselves off* by leaving the community.

Paul explains that justification (being in right relationship with God) comes by faith alone. He then asks, "If we do not follow the law, what guides our behavior?" He answers that the Holy Spirit provides righteousness. The Judaizers (Jewish Christians who believed in following traditional Jewish laws) likely warned that Paul's message of freedom could lead believers to moral failure ([5:1](https://ref.ly/Gal5:1)). Paul argues that freedom is not an excuse to sin because love guides Christians. We should use our freedom to serve each other with love (see also [2:20](https://ref.ly/Gal2:20); [2 Corinthians 5:14–15](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:14-2Cor5:15)).

*The entire law is fulfilled in a single decree*: Jesus's followers fulfill the law by showing love to every neighbor ([Leviticus 19:18](https://ref.ly/Lev19:18); see [Matthew 7:12](https://ref.ly/Matt7:12); [Luke 6:27–36](https://ref.ly/Luke6:27-Luke6:36); [10:25](https://ref.ly/Luke10:25-Luke10:37)[–](https://ref.ly/Luke6:27-Luke6:36)[37](https://ref.ly/Luke10:25-Luke10:37); [John 13:34](https://ref.ly/John13:34-John13:35)[–](https://ref.ly/Luke6:27-Luke6:36)[35](https://ref.ly/John13:34-John13:35); [15:9](https://ref.ly/John15:9-John15:17)[–](https://ref.ly/Luke6:27-Luke6:36)[17](https://ref.ly/John15:9-John15:17); [Romans 13:8](https://ref.ly/Rom13:8-Rom13:10)[–](https://ref.ly/Luke6:27-Luke6:36)[10](https://ref.ly/Rom13:8-Rom13:10)).

The opposite of love is when people hurt and attack each other (see [Psalm 35:25](https://ref.ly/Ps35:25); [Proverbs 30:14](https://ref.ly/Prov30:14); [Jeremiah 8:17](https://ref.ly/Jer8:17)). People who lack love are often bitter and fight with one another. They will eventually harm each other. In contrast, love brings life to others (see [John 3:16](https://ref.ly/John3:16); [15:12](https://ref.ly/John15:12-John15:13)[–](https://ref.ly/Luke6:27-Luke6:36)[13](https://ref.ly/John15:12-John15:13)).

A faith without laws will not cause moral ruin. The Holy Spirit guides people, changing their hearts to follow God's will and not sin (see [Jeremiah 31:33](https://ref.ly/Jer31:33); [Hebrews 8:10](https://ref.ly/Heb8:10)).

## Galatians 5:17 (id: 12184)

We cannot just choose to follow the law and not sin. There is a struggle between God's Spirit and our sinful nature (see [Romans 7:14](https://ref.ly/Rom7:14-Rom7:25)[–](https://ref.ly/Luke6:27-Luke6:36)[25](https://ref.ly/Rom7:14-Rom7:25); [1 Peter 2:11](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:11); compare [Genesis 4:7](https://ref.ly/Gen4:7)). The solution is not trying harder to follow the law, but living by God's Spirit. When we are resurrected, we will finally be free from sin (see [Romans 8:18](https://ref.ly/Rom8:18-Rom8:25)[–](https://ref.ly/Luke6:27-Luke6:36)[25](https://ref.ly/Rom8:18-Rom8:25)).

People guided by the Holy Spirit follow the Spirit's authority, not the law. They answer to the Spirit of God, not the law. Paul did not intend to justify breaking civil laws (see [Romans 13:1](https://ref.ly/Rom13:1-Rom13:7)[–](https://ref.ly/Luke6:27-Luke6:36)[7](https://ref.ly/Rom13:1-Rom13:7); [Titus 3:1](https://ref.ly/Titus3:1); compare [1 Peter 2:13](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:13-1Pet2:17)[–](https://ref.ly/Luke6:27-Luke6:36)[17](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:13-1Pet2:17)). He was talking about how to achieve spiritual righteousness before God.

## Galatians 5:19 (id: 12187)

* *The acts of the flesh are obvious* (literally *The works of the flesh are*): Emphasizing law\-keeping and sinful actions comes from trying to live without God's Spirit.
* *obvious*: All people have a basic sense of right and wrong (see [Romans 1:32](https://ref.ly/Rom1:32); [2:14–15](https://ref.ly/Rom2:14-Rom2:15); [1 Corinthians 5:1](https://ref.ly/1Cor5:1)). But some people still choose to do wrong anyway ([Romans 1:18](https://ref.ly/Rom1:18-Rom1:21)[–](https://ref.ly/Rom2:14-Rom2:15)[21](https://ref.ly/Rom1:18-Rom1:21)).
* The list of acts of the flesh starts with sexual immorality. In contrast, the list of Christian virtues starts with love ([Galatians 5:22](https://ref.ly/Gal5:22)). Various kinds of sexual misconduct were common (see [Romans 1:24](https://ref.ly/Rom1:24-Rom1:27)[–](https://ref.ly/Rom2:14-Rom2:15)[27](https://ref.ly/Rom1:24-Rom1:27); [1 Corinthians 5:1](https://ref.ly/1Cor5:1); [6:15](https://ref.ly/1Cor6:15-1Cor6:18)[–](https://ref.ly/Rom2:14-Rom2:15)[18](https://ref.ly/1Cor6:15-1Cor6:18); [2 Corinthians 12:21](https://ref.ly/2Cor12:21); [2 Peter 3:10](https://ref.ly/2Pet3:10), [18](https://ref.ly/2Pet3:18)). In ancient pagan religions, people engaged in sexual activities as part of their worship of fertility gods and goddesses (see [Revelation 2:14](https://ref.ly/Rev2:14), [20](https://ref.ly/Rev2:20)).
* When people sin, they become spiritually unclean and cannot have fellowship with God, who is perfectly pure and holy (see [Matthew 23:27](https://ref.ly/Matt23:27); [Romans 6:19](https://ref.ly/Rom6:19); [2 Corinthians 12:21](https://ref.ly/2Cor12:21); [Ephesians 5:3](https://ref.ly/Eph5:3); [Colossians 3:5](https://ref.ly/Col3:5); [1 Thessalonians 4:7](https://ref.ly/1Thess4:7)).

Living by the Spirit means following a higher moral standard than the law can provide.

## Galatians 5:20 (id: 12190)

* *Idolatry* (the worship of false gods) was common in Galatia and often included *sorcery* ("magic arts," see [Acts 19:19](https://ref.ly/Acts19:19); compare [1 Samuel 15:23](https://ref.ly/1Sam15:23); [Revelation 9:21](https://ref.ly/Rev9:21); [18:23](https://ref.ly/Rev18:23); [21:8](https://ref.ly/Rev21:8); [22:15](https://ref.ly/Rev22:15)). It also often included sexual immorality (compare [1 Corinthians 6:9](https://ref.ly/1Cor6:9), [15](https://ref.ly/1Cor6:15-1Cor6:20)[–](https://ref.ly/Rom2:14-Rom2:15)[20](https://ref.ly/1Cor6:15-1Cor6:20)).
* *Hatred* causes people to fight with others, which is the opposite of the Holy Spirit's way of humility and love ([Galatians 5:22](https://ref.ly/Gal5:22-Gal5:23)[–](https://ref.ly/Rom2:14-Rom2:15)[23](https://ref.ly/Gal5:22-Gal5:23)).
* *Discord* means causing arguments and looking for fights, not peacefully defending what is right ([1 Corinthians 3:3](https://ref.ly/1Cor3:3); [2 Corinthians 12:20](https://ref.ly/2Cor12:20); [1 Timothy 6:4](https://ref.ly/1Tim6:4); [Titus 3:9](https://ref.ly/Titus3:9)). Those who are guided by the Holy Spirit speak what is true with love and try to make peace with others ([Galatians 5:22](https://ref.ly/Gal5:22); [Ephesians 4:15](https://ref.ly/Eph4:15); [2 Timothy 2:23](https://ref.ly/2Tim2:23-2Tim2:26)[–](https://ref.ly/Rom2:14-Rom2:15)[26](https://ref.ly/2Tim2:23-2Tim2:26)).
* *Jealousy* (in Greek *zēlos*, meaning "zeal") can mean a positive "passionate commitment" or a negative "intense desire for others' things" (compare [James 3:14](https://ref.ly/Jas3:14-Jas3:16)[–](https://ref.ly/Rom2:14-Rom2:15)[16](https://ref.ly/Jas3:14-Jas3:16)).
* *Rage* (violent and uncontrolled anger) is the opposite of self\-control ([Galatians 5:23](https://ref.ly/Gal5:23); see, for example, [Acts 19:28](https://ref.ly/Acts19:28); [2 Corinthians 12:20](https://ref.ly/2Cor12:20); [1 Timothy 3:3](https://ref.ly/1Tim3:3); [Titus 1:7](https://ref.ly/Titus1:7)).
* *Rivalries* (or selfishness) oppose Christian love (compare [Romans 2:8](https://ref.ly/Rom2:8); [Philippians 2:3](https://ref.ly/Phil2:3); [James 3:14](https://ref.ly/Jas3:14), [16](https://ref.ly/Jas3:16)).
* *Factions* (in Greek *haireseis*, meaning "heresies, factions, sects") refers to using different beliefs or practices to divide the community (compare [1 Corinthians 11:17](https://ref.ly/1Cor11:17-1Cor11:19)[–](https://ref.ly/Rom2:14-Rom2:15)[19](https://ref.ly/1Cor11:17-1Cor11:19); [2 Peter 2:1](https://ref.ly/2Pet2:1-2Pet2:3)[–](https://ref.ly/Rom2:14-Rom2:15)[3](https://ref.ly/2Pet2:1-2Pet2:3)).

* *Drunkenness* does not belong in a Christian's life (see [Luke 21:34](https://ref.ly/Luke21:34); [1 Corinthians 11:20](https://ref.ly/1Cor11:20-1Cor11:22)[–](https://ref.ly/Rom2:14-Rom2:15)[22](https://ref.ly/1Cor11:20-1Cor11:22); [Ephesians 5:18](https://ref.ly/Eph5:18)).
* *orgies*: Religious celebrations for false gods often included wild parties with lots of drinking and sexual sin (compare [1 Peter 4:3](https://ref.ly/1Pet4:3)).
* *and the like*: This list shows examples of sinful behaviors (compare [Mark 7:20](https://ref.ly/Mark7:20-Mark7:23)[–](https://ref.ly/Rom2:14-Rom2:15)[23](https://ref.ly/Mark7:20-Mark7:23); [Romans 1:29](https://ref.ly/Rom1:29-Rom1:31)[–](https://ref.ly/Rom2:14-Rom2:15)[31](https://ref.ly/Rom1:29-Rom1:31); [1 Corinthians 6:9](https://ref.ly/1Cor6:9-1Cor6:10)[–](https://ref.ly/Rom2:14-Rom2:15)[10](https://ref.ly/1Cor6:9-1Cor6:10); [Ephesians 5:3](https://ref.ly/Eph5:3-Eph5:5)[–](https://ref.ly/Rom2:14-Rom2:15)[5](https://ref.ly/Eph5:3-Eph5:5); [Colossians 3:5](https://ref.ly/Col3:5-Col3:8)[–](https://ref.ly/Rom2:14-Rom2:15)[8](https://ref.ly/Col3:5-Col3:8); [1 Timothy 1:9](https://ref.ly/1Tim1:9-1Tim1:10)[–](https://ref.ly/Rom2:14-Rom2:15)[10](https://ref.ly/1Tim1:9-1Tim1:10); [2 Tim 3:2](https://ref.ly/2Tim3:2-2Tim3:5)[–](https://ref.ly/Rom2:14-Rom2:15)[5](https://ref.ly/2Tim3:2-2Tim3:5); [James 3:13](https://ref.ly/Jas3:13-Jas3:18)[–](https://ref.ly/Rom2:14-Rom2:15)[18](https://ref.ly/Jas3:13-Jas3:18); [Revelation 21:8](https://ref.ly/Rev21:8)). People living this way do not follow the Holy Spirit and so they do not show a relationship with God by faith. Such people will not inherit the kingdom of God. They remain slaves to their sinful nature ([Galatians 4:8](https://ref.ly/Gal4:8-Gal4:9)[–](https://ref.ly/Rom2:14-Rom2:15)[9](https://ref.ly/Gal4:8-Gal4:9), [22](https://ref.ly/Gal4:22-Gal4:25)[–](https://ref.ly/Rom2:14-Rom2:15)[25](https://ref.ly/Gal4:22-Gal4:25); compare [Romans 6:16](https://ref.ly/Rom6:16-Rom6:22)[–](https://ref.ly/Rom2:14-Rom2:15)[22](https://ref.ly/Rom6:16-Rom6:22); [1 Corinthians 6:9](https://ref.ly/1Cor6:9-1Cor6:10)[–](https://ref.ly/Rom2:14-Rom2:15)[10](https://ref.ly/1Cor6:9-1Cor6:10)). They are not under God’s rule.

* Choosing to follow the Holy Spirit leads to a life that pleases God, unlike following sinful desires ([5:16](https://ref.ly/Gal5:16); [5:19–21](https://ref.ly/Gal5:19-Gal5:21)). Human effort and laws cannot achieve this (compare [John 15:1](https://ref.ly/John15:1-John15:8)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal5:19-Gal5:21)[8](https://ref.ly/John15:1-John15:8)).
* This list of virtues addresses issues in the Galatian church.
* *Love* is the greatest Christian virtue and includes all others ([1 Corinthians 13:4](https://ref.ly/1Cor13:4-1Cor13:7)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal5:19-Gal5:21)[7](https://ref.ly/1Cor13:4-1Cor13:7)). Only God's Spirit can help us love those who hate us (see [Matthew 5:43](https://ref.ly/Matt5:43-Matt5:48)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal5:19-Gal5:21)[48](https://ref.ly/Matt5:43-Matt5:48); [Luke 6:35](https://ref.ly/Luke6:35-Luke6:36)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal5:19-Gal5:21)[36](https://ref.ly/Luke6:35-Luke6:36)).
* *Joy* from the Holy Spirit does not depend on circumstances (see [Romans 15:13](https://ref.ly/Rom15:13); [2 Corinthians 6:10](https://ref.ly/2Cor6:10); [8:2](https://ref.ly/2Cor8:2); [1 Thessalonians 1:6](https://ref.ly/1Thess1:6)).
* *Peace* with God brings inner well\-being ([Romans 5:1](https://ref.ly/Rom5:1); [Ephesians 2:15](https://ref.ly/Eph2:15); [Philippians 4:6](https://ref.ly/Phil4:6-Phil4:7)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal5:19-Gal5:21)[7](https://ref.ly/Phil4:6-Phil4:7); [Colossians 1:20](https://ref.ly/Col1:20)). It helps us become peacemakers with others (see [Matthew 5:9](https://ref.ly/Matt5:9); [Romans 8:6](https://ref.ly/Rom8:6); [12:18](https://ref.ly/Rom12:18); [14:17](https://ref.ly/Rom14:17-Rom14:19)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal5:19-Gal5:21)[19](https://ref.ly/Rom14:17-Rom14:19); [2 Corinthians 13:11](https://ref.ly/2Cor13:11); [Ephesians 4:3](https://ref.ly/Eph4:3); [6:15](https://ref.ly/Eph6:15)).
* *Patience* (or tolerance or long\-suffering) helps us endure difficult situations and be patient with others ([Ephesians 4:2](https://ref.ly/Eph4:2); [2 Timothy 4:2](https://ref.ly/2Tim4:2); [James 5:10](https://ref.ly/Jas5:10-Jas5:11)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal5:19-Gal5:21)[11](https://ref.ly/Jas5:10-Jas5:11)). God is patient with us ([Exodus 34:6](https://ref.ly/Exod34:6); [Psalms 103:8](https://ref.ly/Ps103:8); [Romans 2:4](https://ref.ly/Rom2:4); [9:22](https://ref.ly/Rom9:22); [1 Timothy 1:16](https://ref.ly/1Tim1:16); [2 Peter 3:15](https://ref.ly/2Pet3:15)). God promises to be with those who are patient with others ([Isaiah 57:15](https://ref.ly/Isa57:15)).
* *Kindness* means being generous and helping others, showing the same spirit of giving that God shows to us ([Romans 2:4](https://ref.ly/Rom2:4); [11:22](https://ref.ly/Rom11:22); [Titus 3:4](https://ref.ly/Titus3:4-Titus3:6)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal5:19-Gal5:21)[6](https://ref.ly/Titus3:4-Titus3:6)).
* *Goodness*: Compare [Romans 15:14](https://ref.ly/Rom15:14); [Ephesians 5:9](https://ref.ly/Eph5:9); [2 Thessalonians 1:11](https://ref.ly/2Thess1:11).
* *Faithfulness* (or *faith*) means being reliable and trustworthy in our relationships, just as God is with us ([1 Corinthians 1:9](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:9); [10:13](https://ref.ly/1Cor10:13); [2 Thessalonians 3:3](https://ref.ly/2Thess3:3)).

* Gentleness is the opposite of the bad behaviors in [5:20](https://ref.ly/Gal5:20) and requires strength (see [Proverbs 15:1](https://ref.ly/Prov15:1), [4](https://ref.ly/Prov15:4); [Matthew 11:28](https://ref.ly/Matt11:28-Matt11:29)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal5:19-Gal5:21)[29](https://ref.ly/Matt11:28-Matt11:29); [Ephesians 4:2](https://ref.ly/Eph4:2)).
* *Self\-control*: The Holy Spirit does not allow immoral behavior but helps people avoid sin (compare [Galatians 5:13](https://ref.ly/Gal5:13); [Romans 6:14](https://ref.ly/Rom6:14-Rom6:18)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal5:19-Gal5:21)[18](https://ref.ly/Rom6:14-Rom6:18); [1 Thessalonians 4:3](https://ref.ly/1Thess4:3-1Thess4:7)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal5:19-Gal5:21)[7](https://ref.ly/1Thess4:3-1Thess4:7); [1 Peter 2:16](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:16); see also [Acts 24:25](https://ref.ly/Acts24:25); [Titus 1:8](https://ref.ly/Titus1:8)).

We should not think we are better than others. Instead, we should focus on our own actions and make sure we follow Christ in everything (see [1 Corinthians 3:12](https://ref.ly/1Cor3:12-1Cor3:15)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal5:13-Gal6:10)[15](https://ref.ly/1Cor3:12-1Cor3:15)).

If believers take responsibility for themselves ([6:4](https://ref.ly/Gal6:4)), they will not treat others as if they are worth less than themselves ([6:3](https://ref.ly/Gal6:3)).

Living to please the Spirit is only possible with the Spirit's power ([3:3](https://ref.ly/Gal3:3); [5:16](https://ref.ly/Gal5:16)). People who rely on their own efforts or do whatever they want are in the same situation: They live to satisfy their own sinful desires. These people will face decay and death. Those who live by the Spirit's power and trust in God will gain everlasting life.

* *Let us not grow weary*: Avoid letting sinful behavior sneak in or relying on strict rules instead of following the Spirit ([5:25](https://ref.ly/Gal5:25)).
* *for in due time we will reap a harvest*: This promise encourages Christians to keep doing good work (see [Romans 8:28](https://ref.ly/Rom8:28)).
* *if we do not give up*: God's promises to believers require them to keep their faith strong (see also [Luke 18:1](https://ref.ly/Luke18:1); [2 Corinthians 4:1](https://ref.ly/2Cor4:1)).

* *Therefore*: This statement forms an *inclusio* that marks the beginning and end of this section ([5:13–6:10](https://ref.ly/Gal5:13-Gal6:10)), like two bookends that hold it together by repeating the theme from [5:13](https://ref.ly/Gal5:13): Freedom in the Spirit urges us to do good to others with love.
* Doing good to those in the faith community shows God's faithfulness to his children. This action directly shows how God meets all their needs.

## Galatians 6:11–18 (id: 12208)

Paul picked up the writing tool from his *amanuensis* (secretary) and wrote a postscript himself. He did this to prove the letter was truly his and to make a final appeal.

## Galatians 6:12–13 (id: 12209)

Despite their theological arguments, the false teachers were self\-serving. They wanted approval from non\-Christian Jews and cared more about their reputation than honoring God.

## Galatians 6:14 (id: 12210)

* Unlike the false teachers mentioned in [6:12–13](https://ref.ly/Gal6:12-Gal6:13), Paul wanted to increase God's glory. He did not want to increase his own reputation. Boasting about following the law would take away from recognizing the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.
* In the Greco\-Roman world, the cross seemed foolish to non\-believers ([5:11](https://ref.ly/Gal5:11); [1 Corinthians 1:23](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:23); compare [John 6:53](https://ref.ly/John6:53-John6:61)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal6:12-Gal6:13)[61](https://ref.ly/John6:53-John6:61)). But it is the foundation of a Christian's faith and hope ([1 Corinthians 1:17](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:17-1Cor1:18)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal6:12-Gal6:13)[18](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:17-1Cor1:18); [15:3](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:3); [Philippians 2:8](https://ref.ly/Phil2:8-Phil2:11)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal6:12-Gal6:13)[11](https://ref.ly/Phil2:8-Phil2:11); [Colossians 1:20](https://ref.ly/Col1:20-Col1:22)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal6:12-Gal6:13)[22](https://ref.ly/Col1:20-Col1:22); [2:14](https://ref.ly/Col2:14-Col2:15)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal6:12-Gal6:13)[15](https://ref.ly/Col2:14-Col2:15)).

The Galatians misunderstood the good news about Jesus. A new creation comes through Jesus Christ by the Holy Spirit, not by human effort (compare [2 Corinthians 5:16](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:16-2Cor5:17)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal6:12-Gal6:13)[17](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:16-2Cor5:17)).

## Galatians 6:16 (id: 12212)

* *This rule* is trusting Jesus for salvation ([6:14](https://ref.ly/Gal6:14-Gal6:15)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal6:12-Gal6:13)[15](https://ref.ly/Gal6:14-Gal6:15)).

* *even to the Israel of God*: The Greek word *kai* is usually translated as "and." It can also mean "even." If it means "and," then the *Israel of God* is a different group from *all who walk by this rule.* If it means "even," then they are the same group. 
  
The Jewish people still have a special identity before God ([Romans 9:1](https://ref.ly/Rom9:1-Rom9:5)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal6:12-Gal6:13)[5](https://ref.ly/Rom9:1-Rom9:5); [10:1](https://ref.ly/Rom10:1-Rom10:4)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal6:12-Gal6:13)[4](https://ref.ly/Rom10:1-Rom10:4); [11:1](https://ref.ly/Rom11:1-Rom11:32)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal6:12-Gal6:13)[32](https://ref.ly/Rom11:1-Rom11:32)). Gentiles (non\-Jewish people) who believe have been included, and Jews who do not believe have been removed from spiritual Israel ([Romans 11:17](https://ref.ly/Rom11:17-Rom11:24)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal6:12-Gal6:13)[24](https://ref.ly/Rom11:17-Rom11:24); compare [Philippians 3:2](https://ref.ly/Phil3:2-Phil3:3)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal6:12-Gal6:13)[3](https://ref.ly/Phil3:2-Phil3:3); [Colossians 2:11](https://ref.ly/Col2:11-Col2:12)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal6:12-Gal6:13)[12](https://ref.ly/Col2:11-Col2:12)). Paul sees all Christians as the true Israel (see [Romans 2:28](https://ref.ly/Rom2:28-Rom2:29)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal6:12-Gal6:13)[29](https://ref.ly/Rom2:28-Rom2:29); [9:6](https://ref.ly/Rom9:6-Rom9:8)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal6:12-Gal6:13)[8](https://ref.ly/Rom9:6-Rom9:8); compare [Galatians 4:21](https://ref.ly/Gal4:21-Gal4:31)[–](https://ref.ly/Gal6:12-Gal6:13)[31](https://ref.ly/Gal4:21-Gal4:31)). 
  
The phrase *the Israel of God* is not found elsewhere in the New Testament or other writings. Perhaps false teachers promised this identity to gentiles who accepted circumcision. If so, Paul shows why their argument was wrong: The non\-Jewish Christians in Galatia did not need circumcision, as they were already God's *Israel—*his true people—through faith in Christ.

## Galatians 6:17 (id: 12213)

* *let no one cause me trouble*: No one has the right to criticize Paul or his message because he is a proven servant of Jesus.
* Paul's scars (in Greek *stigmata*) likely came from the severe persecution he experienced as a servant of Jesus (see [Acts 14:19](https://ref.ly/Acts14:19); [2 Corinthians 6:4–10](https://ref.ly/2Cor6:4-2Cor6:10); [11:21–33](https://ref.ly/2Cor11:21-2Cor11:33)). Unlike the physical mark of circumcision that false teachers in Galatia wanted to force on non\-Jewish Christians, Paul's scars from suffering showed he was truly Jesus's servant (compare [Exodus 21:6](https://ref.ly/Exod21:6)).

Paul prayed at the end of this letter just as he did at the start ([1:3–4](https://ref.ly/Gal1:3-Gal1:4)). The Galatians needed the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ to be with their spirit more than they needed the law.
