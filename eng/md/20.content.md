## Proverbs 1:1 (id: 23166)

Solomon is the authority on Israelite wisdom (see [1 Kings 3:1–28](https://ref.ly/1Kgs3:1-1Kgs3:28); [4:32](https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:32)). Many proverbs are attributed to Solomon, but he did not write all of them (see [Proverbs 22:17](https://ref.ly/Prov22:17); [24:23](https://ref.ly/Prov24:23); [25:1](https://ref.ly/Prov25:1); [30:1](https://ref.ly/Prov30:1); [31:1](https://ref.ly/Prov31:1)).

## Proverbs 1:2–3 (id: 23167)

Wisdom is practical knowledge that involves ethical choices. Words like *right, just,* and *fair* are associated with biblical wisdom. Gaining wisdom requires discipline, which means actively and intentionally training yourself toward wisdom and away from foolishness. The book of Proverbs encourages us to resist our natural sinful tendencies toward wrong behavior.

* **Associated Passages:** PRO 1:2–PRO 1:3

## Proverbs 1:2–7 (id: 23168)

This introduction explains the book's purpose and identifies the different audiences it addresses.

* **Associated Passages:** PRO 1:2–PRO 1:7

## Proverbs 1:4 (id: 23177)

Simple people are like empty containers. Wisdom and foolishness compete to fill their minds and hearts (see [Proverbs 9:1–18](https://ref.ly/Prov9:1-Prov9:18)).

* **Associated Passages:** PRO 1:4

## Proverbs 1:6 (id: 23178)

Proverbs help wise people understand riddles. Here the Hebrew word (*khidoth*) means enigmas or paradoxes—difficult sayings that need interpretation (see [Judges 14:14](https://ref.ly/Judg14:14)).

* **Associated Passages:** PRO 1:6

## Proverbs 1:7 (id: 23179)

Fear of the Lord means relying completely on God for everything, including knowledge and wisdom ([Proverbs 9:10](https://ref.ly/Prov9:10)). It is not just a way of thinking; it involves serving, loving, and obeying God’s laws (see [Deuteronomy 10:12–13](https://ref.ly/Deut10:12-Deut10:13)). Fear of the Lord is the basis of all knowledge. How can we understand life without knowing its most basic truth—that God created it?

* **Associated Passages:** PRO 1:7

## Proverbs 1:8–19 (id: 23180)

In the book of Proverbs, there are two paths ([Proverbs 1:15](https://ref.ly/Prov1:15)):

* A wise and just path
* A foolish and evil path

The parents represent the wise path and encourage their child to follow it.

* **Associated Passages:** PRO 1:8–PRO 1:19

## Proverbs 1:8–9.18 (id: 23181)

*my son*: Like other wisdom literature from the ancient Near East, much of [Proverbs 1–9](https://ref.ly/Prov1:1-Prov9:18) contains a father's (and sometimes a mother's) advice to a son. Since the son is learning his father's job, much of the teaching is about the son's future work. Some translations (like The New Living Translation) often use the term *child* because the lessons apply to both sons and daughters.

* **Associated Passages:** PRO 1:8

## Proverbs 1:9 (id: 23182)

*garland of grace… pendant*: Ornaments often symbolize wisdom and its rewards (see also [Proverbs 3:22](https://ref.ly/Prov3:22); [4:9](https://ref.ly/Prov4:9)). This imagery encourages people to seek wisdom with effort.

* **Associated Passages:** PRO 1:9

## Proverbs 1:10–19 (id: 23163)

The father warns his child not to join a group of wrongdoers planning to attack innocent people. Their evil actions will eventually harm them (see [Proverbs 28:10](https://ref.ly/Prov28:10); [Psalms 9:15](https://ref.ly/Ps9:15); [35:8](https://ref.ly/Ps35:8)). The evil path involves violence and theft.

* **Associated Passages:** PRO 1:10–PRO 1:19

## Proverbs 1:12 (id: 23164)

*like Sheol*: In the Old Testament, Sheol is the place of the dead. It is not always associated with punishment.

* **Associated Passages:** PRO 1:12

## Proverbs 1:17–19 (id: 23165)

Birds avoid obvious traps, but greedy people do not. When they choose violence and robbery, they risk losing their lives violently. They might die during the crime or be punished with death if caught. Even if wrongdoers succeed until they die, they will experience judgment after death, while the righteous will be with God (see [Psalm 1](https://ref.ly/Ps1:1-Ps1:6)).

* **Associated Passages:** PRO 1:17–PRO 1:19

## Proverbs 1:20–33 (id: 23169)

The author describes wisdom as a woman. In Hebrew, the word for wisdom, *khokmah*, is grammatically feminine. The author encourages his son to embrace wisdom (see [Proverbs 3:18](https://ref.ly/Prov3:18); [8:1–9:6](https://ref.ly/Prov8:1-Prov9:6)).

* **Associated Passages:** PRO 1:20–PRO 1:33

## Proverbs 1:22 (id: 23170)

Proverbs uses three main words to describe those who lack God's wisdom: 

* Simple ones (Hebrew *pethim*) have not rejected God's wisdom and are most open to correction (see [Proverbs 1:4](https://ref.ly/Prov1:4)).
* Fools (Hebrew *kesilim*) have heard God's wisdom but resist it.
* Scoffers (Hebrew *latsonim*) not only resist wisdom but also ridicule it.

* **Associated Passages:** PRO 1:22

## Proverbs 1:23 (id: 23171)

Wisdom invites all three groups to come so she can make them wise ([Proverbs 1:22](https://ref.ly/Prov1:22)). Having a close relationship with Wisdom means beginning a close relationship with God, which is the basis of true knowledge ([Proverbs 1:7](https://ref.ly/Prov1:7); see [Job 28](https://ref.ly/Job28:1-Job28:28)).

* **Associated Passages:** PRO 1:23

## Proverbs 1:24–27 (id: 23172)

*you neglected all my counsel*: This is like ignoring God's call (see [Psalm 14](https://ref.ly/Ps14:1-Ps14:7)). God calls us through: 

* creation ([Psalm 8](https://ref.ly/Ps8:1-Ps8:9); [Romans 1:18–20](https://ref.ly/Rom1:18-Rom1:20))
* Scripture ([2 Timothy 3:16–17](https://ref.ly/2Tim3:16-2Tim3:17); [2 Peter 1:20–21](https://ref.ly/2Pet1:20-2Pet1:21))

* **Associated Passages:** PRO 1:24–PRO 1:27

* **Associated Passages:** PRO 1:29–PRO 1:30

## Proverbs 1:31 (id: 23175)

People who do wrong will face the results of their actions (see [Proverbs 1:15–19](https://ref.ly/Prov1:15-Prov1:19)). God will make sure that sinners get the proper punishment (see [Matthew 25:44–46](https://ref.ly/Matt25:44-Matt25:46); [Hebrews 10:29](https://ref.ly/Heb10:29); [2 Peter 2:9](https://ref.ly/2Pet2:9)).

* **Associated Passages:** PRO 2:4

## Proverbs 2:5 (id: 23341)

The search for true wisdom leads to God. You cannot have wisdom without the fear of the Lord (having a great reverence, honor, and respect for God) ([Proverbs 1:7](https://ref.ly/Prov1:7)).

* **Associated Passages:** PRO 2:5

## Proverbs 2:6 (id: 23342)

The Lord gives wisdom to those who learn it from the Scriptures, which are his words ([2 Timothy 3:16](https://ref.ly/2Tim3:16); [2 Peter 1:20–21](https://ref.ly/2Pet1:20-2Pet1:21)). You cannot become wise through observation alone.

* **Associated Passages:** PRO 2:6

## Proverbs 2:7–8 (id: 23343)

Here, common sense is the natural understanding gained by listening to God's words and observing his world. God acts as a shield, guarding and protecting those who have a relationship with him.

* **Associated Passages:** PRO 2:7–PRO 2:8

## Proverbs 2:10 (id: 23332)

* **Associated Passages:** PRO 2:12–PRO 2:15

## Proverbs 2:16 (id: 23334)

## Proverbs 2:17 (id: 23335)

## Proverbs 2:20–22 (id: 23339)

Those who make wise choices will live in the land; those who do not will be evicted.

Because they broke his law, they were expelled in 586 BC (see [2 Kings 25:1–30](https://ref.ly/2Kgs25:1-2Kgs25:30); [2 Chronicles 36:15–21](https://ref.ly/2Chr36:15-2Chr36:21)).

Light symbolizes wisdom and righteousness, while darkness represents foolishness and wickedness (see [Ecclesiastes 2:12–14](https://ref.ly/Eccl2:12-Eccl2:14)).

Other Mesopotamian texts mention “the disease of intercourse” and the “disease of Ishtar” (goddess of love), which show symptoms of venereal diseases.

To drink from one's own well (see also [Song 4:12](https://ref.ly/Song4:12), [15](https://ref.ly/Song4:15)) means to enjoy sexual relations within marriage. Instead of spending sexual energy on immoral women, a man should build a healthy sexual relationship with his wife. Sex should not be shared with strangers. This honors marriage ([Genesis 2:22–25](https://ref.ly/Gen2:22-Gen2:25)) and follows the seventh commandment ([Exodus 20:14](https://ref.ly/Exod20:14) and [Deuteronomy 5:18](https://ref.ly/Deut5:18)).

Generosity is a trait of the godly, while stinginess is a trait of fools ([Proverbs 29:7](https://ref.ly/Prov29:7), [14](https://ref.ly/Prov29:14)). Interestingly, the more you give, the more you receive ([Proverbs 11:24](https://ref.ly/Prov11:24)).
