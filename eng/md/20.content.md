## Proverbs 1:1 (id: 23166)

Solomon is the authority on Israelite wisdom (see [1 Kings 3:1–28](https://ref.ly/1Kgs3:1-1Kgs3:28); [4:32](https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:32)). Many proverbs are attributed to Solomon, but he did not write all of them (see [Proverbs 22:17](https://ref.ly/Prov22:17); [24:23](https://ref.ly/Prov24:23); [25:1](https://ref.ly/Prov25:1); [30:1](https://ref.ly/Prov30:1); [31:1](https://ref.ly/Prov31:1)).

## Proverbs 1:2–3 (id: 23167)

Wisdom is practical knowledge that involves ethical choices. Words like *right, just,* and *fair* are associated with biblical wisdom. Gaining wisdom requires discipline, which means actively and intentionally training yourself toward wisdom and away from foolishness. The book of Proverbs encourages us to resist our natural sinful tendencies toward wrong behavior.

## Proverbs 1:4 (id: 23177)

Simple people are like empty containers. Wisdom and foolishness compete to fill their minds and hearts (see [Proverbs 9:1–18](https://ref.ly/Prov9:1-Prov9:18)).

## Proverbs 1:6 (id: 23178)

Proverbs help wise people understand riddles. Here the Hebrew word (*khidoth*) means enigmas or paradoxes—difficult sayings that need interpretation (see [Judges 14:14](https://ref.ly/Judg14:14)).

* **Associated Passages:** PRO 1:6
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Proverbs 1:7 (id: 23179)

Fear of the Lord means relying completely on God for everything, including knowledge and wisdom ([Proverbs 9:10](https://ref.ly/Prov9:10)). It is not just a way of thinking; it involves serving, loving, and obeying God’s laws (see [Deuteronomy 10:12–13](https://ref.ly/Deut10:12-Deut10:13)). Fear of the Lord is the basis of all knowledge. How can we understand life without knowing its most basic truth—that God created it?

## Proverbs 1:8–19 (id: 23180)

In the book of Proverbs, there are two paths ([Proverbs 1:15](https://ref.ly/Prov1:15)):

* A wise and just path
* A foolish and evil path

The parents represent the wise path and encourage their child to follow it.

* **Associated Passages:** PRO 1:8–PRO 1:19
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Proverbs 1:8–9.18 (id: 23181)

*my son*: Like other wisdom literature from the ancient Near East, much of [Proverbs 1–9](https://ref.ly/Prov1:1-Prov9:18) contains a father's (and sometimes a mother's) advice to a son. Since the son is learning his father's job, much of the teaching is about the son's future work. Some translations (like The New Living Translation) often use the term *child* because the lessons apply to both sons and daughters.

* **Associated Passages:** PRO 1:8
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Proverbs 1:9 (id: 23182)

*garland of grace… pendant*: Ornaments often symbolize wisdom and its rewards (see also [Proverbs 3:22](https://ref.ly/Prov3:22); [4:9](https://ref.ly/Prov4:9)). This imagery encourages people to seek wisdom with effort.

* **Associated Passages:** PRO 1:9
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Proverbs 1:10–19 (id: 23163)

The father warns his child not to join a group of wrongdoers planning to attack innocent people. Their evil actions will eventually harm them (see [Proverbs 28:10](https://ref.ly/Prov28:10); [Psalms 9:15](https://ref.ly/Ps9:15); [35:8](https://ref.ly/Ps35:8)). The evil path involves violence and theft.

## Proverbs 1:17–19 (id: 23165)

Birds avoid obvious traps, but greedy people do not. When they choose violence and robbery, they risk losing their lives violently. They might die during the crime or be punished with death if caught. Even if wrongdoers succeed until they die, they will experience judgment after death, while the righteous will be with God (see [Psalm 1](https://ref.ly/Ps1:1-Ps1:6)).

* **Associated Passages:** PRO 1:17–PRO 1:19
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Proverbs 1:20–33 (id: 23169)

The author describes wisdom as a woman. In Hebrew, the word for wisdom, *khokmah*, is grammatically feminine. The author encourages his son to embrace wisdom (see [Proverbs 3:18](https://ref.ly/Prov3:18); [8:1–9:6](https://ref.ly/Prov8:1-Prov9:6)).

* **Associated Passages:** PRO 1:20–PRO 1:33
* **Associated Articles:** 

## Proverbs 1:22 (id: 23170)

Proverbs uses three main words to describe those who lack God's wisdom: 

* Simple ones (Hebrew *pethim*) have not rejected God's wisdom and are most open to correction (see [Proverbs 1:4](https://ref.ly/Prov1:4)).
* Fools (Hebrew *kesilim*) have heard God's wisdom but resist it.
* Scoffers (Hebrew *latsonim*) not only resist wisdom but also ridicule it.

## Proverbs 1:23 (id: 23171)

Wisdom invites all three groups to come so she can make them wise ([Proverbs 1:22](https://ref.ly/Prov1:22)). Having a close relationship with Wisdom means beginning a close relationship with God, which is the basis of true knowledge ([Proverbs 1:7](https://ref.ly/Prov1:7); see [Job 28](https://ref.ly/Job28:1-Job28:28)).

* **Associated Passages:** PRO 1:23

## Proverbs 1:24–27 (id: 23172)

* Scripture ([2 Timothy 3:16–17](https://ref.ly/2Tim3:16-2Tim3:17); [2 Peter 1:20–21](https://ref.ly/2Pet1:20-2Pet1:21))

Light symbolizes wisdom and righteousness, while darkness represents foolishness and wickedness (see [Ecclesiastes 2:12–14](https://ref.ly/Eccl2:12-Eccl2:14)).

To drink from one's own well (see also [Song 4:12](https://ref.ly/Song4:12), [15](https://ref.ly/Song4:15)) means to enjoy sexual relations within marriage. Instead of spending sexual energy on immoral women, a man should build a healthy sexual relationship with his wife. Sex should not be shared with strangers. This honors marriage ([Genesis 2:22–25](https://ref.ly/Gen2:22-Gen2:25)) and follows the seventh commandment ([Exodus 20:14](https://ref.ly/Exod20:14) and [Deuteronomy 5:18](https://ref.ly/Deut5:18)).

The first part of Proverbs reaches a peak when the son meets two women. Both invite the young man, and the reader, into a close relationship. The young man and the reader must choose between:
