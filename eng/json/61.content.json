Because of the dispute in Antioch (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal2:11-Gal2:14\">Gal 2:11–14</a>), it is sometimes thought that the two were hostile to one another, but the New Testament paints a different picture. Peter and Paul essentially agreed about the Good News for the Gentiles (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts11:2-Acts11:18\">Acts 11:2–18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts15:7-Acts15:11\">15:7–11</a>). Silas and Mark were associates of both Paul and Peter (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet5:12-1Pet5:13\">1&nbsp;Pet 5:12–13</a>). According to tradition, both apostles were martyred in Rome during the same persecution by Nero in the mid-60s&nbsp;AD.</p>",
