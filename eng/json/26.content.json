    "content": "<p>of my thirtieth year: Priests began to minister in the Jerusalem Temple when they were thirty years old. Ezekiel was a priest (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek1:3\">1:3</a>), but he was with the Judean exiles .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in Babylon and was therefore unable to serve in the usual ways. Ezekiel’s identity as a priest in exile is significant to the message that follows. The exiles felt cut off from God and from conventional ways of appealing to him in the Temple. In the ancient world, most gods were closely tied to particular lands, so it was easy for those who were removed from the Promised Land to assume that the Lord was no longer interested in them. That God’s word had come to a prophet among the exiles in Babylon showed that God had not forgotten them and still had a future for them. •&nbsp;The Kebar River was probably a large irrigation canal in the Nippur region southeast of Babylon. The Babylonians (Babylonians) had deported the previous occupants because of their Assyrian sympathies and replaced them with exiles from elsewhere in their empire, including Judah. The Babylonians generally resettled peoples by ethnic groups and allowed them to retain their identity, unlike the Assyrians, whose policy of exile was to disperse and scatter populations. This difference later made it possible for the remnant of the exiles of Judah to return to their homeland. Those who had been exiled from the northern kingdom by the Assyrians were not able to return in the same way.</p>",

Judah had been subjugated by the Babylonians in 597&nbsp;BC, and King Jehoiachin had been carried into exile in Babylon at that time. Jehoiachin’s uncle, Zedekiah, ruled Judah as a Babylonian vassal (597–586&nbsp;BC). Ezekiel dates his prophecy with reference to Jehoiachin’s captivity rather than to Zedekiah’s reign because he seems to have viewed Zedekiah as a stand-in for the lawful king, Jehoiachin. Zedekiah later rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs24:20\">2&nbsp;Kgs 24:20</a>), who besieged the city of Jerusalem (588&nbsp;BC), destroyed it, and burned the Temple (586&nbsp;BC).</p>",

This phrase reminded Ezekiel that he was profoundly different from the heavenly beings before whom he stood. In contrast to them, he was a child of the dust, a mere mortal. It also marked him out from the nation of Israel (literally <em>the sons of Israel</em>). They were a rebellious nation<em>,</em> true descendants of Jacob, whose defining characteristic was striving with God and man (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen32:28\">Gen 32:28</a>). As a son of Adam, Ezekiel represented a new community of faith, empowered by the Spirit to form a life of radical obedience. He was a sign of hope to the exiles. Jesus is the ultimate <em>son of man</em> who combines in himself the human aspect of the title with the exalted heavenly aspect (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan7:13-Dan7:14\">Dan 7:13–14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev1:13-Rev1:20\">Rev 1:13–20</a>). By obeying where Adam failed, Jesus became the first member of God’s new community of faith. All other children of Adam find hope in him.</p>",

However, minor variations in the spelling of names are common in the Hebrew Old Testament. Ezekiel and his hearers would certainly have known of the biblical prophet Daniel as a model of righteousness and wisdom.

As elsewhere in the Old Testament, tree imagery stands for the royal line, with a new shoot representing a fresh start (cp. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa11:1\">Isa 11:1</a>). The judgment upon the vine would not end the monarchy after all. God would plant a fresh branch that would grow into a more majestic cedar than the first cedar had ever been. Although the present dynasty of kings had reached a dead end in Zedekiah, a new beginning was not only possible but inevitable in God’s time (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hag2:21-Hag2:23\">Hag 2:21–23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt1:11-Matt1:16\">Matt 1:11–16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt2:1-Matt2:11\">2:1–11</a>). •&nbsp;God cuts the tall tree down, makes the short tree grow tall<em>,</em> and gives the dead tree new life<em>,</em> enabling birds of every sort (representing the nations) to find shelter and shade under its branches. God’s promise of an eternal throne for David would not ultimately be thwarted by the failures of David’s descendants, the kings of Judah. One day, the dynasty of David—in the person of Jesus—would once again be raised up as the source of blessing for all nations.</p>",

Though they would feel the loss deeply in their hearts, the scale of the devastation would be so overwhelming that there would be no opportunity for normal mourning rites. In the context of such terrible and complete desolation, only internal grief could be observed.</p>",

He personifies the city of Tyre, so his fate represents Tyre’s fate. In his arrogance, the prince of Tyre laid claim to divinity and the power that goes with it, asserting that he sat on a divine throne<em>,</em> ruling the chaotic, untamable seas. The reality, however, was otherwise; he was only a man. •&nbsp;This chapter and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa14:1-Isa14:32\">Isa 14</a> (about the king of Babylon) have often been interpreted as referring to the heavenly conflict between God and Satan, “the prince of demons” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt12:24\">Matt 12:24</a>). However, this view ignores the historical nature of both passages. Tyre and Babylon were real places and their kings were real men whose great power was matched by great pride. The king of Tyre’s claim to be a god proved hollow. The political powers that oppose God and his people may be agents of Satan in his struggle against God. The sure demise of such human rulers foreshadows God’s ultimate triumph over all the forces of darkness. Every power that sets itself up against the living God will be brought to destruction.</p>",

There would be judgment on the shepherds (the former kings of Judah) because they failed to care for their flocks (the people of Judah). The Lord would also judge the fat sheep<em>,</em> but he would intervene as a good shepherd to feed the remainder of the flock. The image of the shepherd perfectly conveys the toughness and tenderness of God’s dealings with his people. The shepherd was also a common metaphor for a king in the ancient Near East. The earthly king was understood to represent the divine shepherd who had set him over his people. Shepherds had to protect their flocks against beasts, including lions and bears, while also knowing their sheep by name and tenderly leading them to good pasture and quiet waters. They had to endure cold, heat, wind, rain, and snow out on the hills with their charges. Good kings who led their people strongly and wisely resembled shepherds. The same image is used in the New Testament to describe pastors and elders, who are to oversee the flock assigned to their care without lording it over them (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet5:2-1Pet5:4\">1&nbsp;Pet 5:2–4</a>). Jesus perfectly combines toughness and tenderness as the “great Shepherd of the sheep” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb13:20\">Heb 13:20</a>).</p>",

God had made Israel clean, while the Gentile nations had remained unclean. Then Israel as a nation became unclean because of their bloodshed and idolatry, which defiled the land. Because they behaved like the unclean nations, Israel’s punishment of being scattered among the nations was fitting. In the future, God would make them clean so that he could dwell among them again. The other nations, seeing his holiness in his people, would once again know that he is the Holy One. In the New Testament, God’s redemption through Christ redraws the lines between clean and unclean (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts10:15\">Acts 10:15</a>). The Gentiles are no longer outside of God’s grace; they too can receive the Holy Spirit and become clean. Jews and Gentiles together now make up the one people of God in Christ. Those who are in Christ Jesus are not only clean, but also holy by virtue of his priesthood. Therefore, they are able to come boldly into God’s presence and experience his grace (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb12:18-Heb12:29\">Heb 12:18–29</a>).</p>",

    "content": "<p>The idyllic scene in ch <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek37:1-Ezek37:28\">37</a> of the reunited nation living at peace in its own land gives way to gathering storm clouds in chs <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek38:1-Ezek39:29\">38–39</a>, a two-panel depiction of the assault, defeat, and disposal of the last enemy, Gog. Readers have long sought to identify Gog, who has sometimes been identified with Gyges, king of Lydia (about 680~644&nbsp;BC). The biblical Gog, however, transcends historical categories; the text is less concerned with Gog’s identity than with the universal threat caused by the nations of the world. Yet even such an overwhelming force would be no serious threat to the restored people of God, for God was now dwelling in their midst. The symbolism of these chapters has much in common with psalms of Zion’s security (see, e.g., <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps2:1-Ps2:12\">Pss 2</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps46:1-Ps46:11\">46</a>). If even a fearsome foe such as Gog could not separate God’s people from his protection, then surely nothing in all creation could do so. •&nbsp;Ezekiel’s account of Gog contains some of the characteristics of apocalyptic literature (see “<span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"203261\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleStudyNotesThemes\">Apocalyptic Literature</span>” Theme Note).</p>",

    "content": "<p>The land assigned to the tribes was arranged in strips running east to west through the land, rather than piecemeal as it was before the Exile. This was more than simply a way of ensuring that each tribe received equal access to the various resources of the land. It aligned the land with the sacred east–west axis that was so prominent in the Temple. As in the Temple, the size and shape of the central areas were clearly defined, while those on the margins were less closely determined (see <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"10977\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleStudyNotes\">study note on 40:17–19</span>). The four tribes most distant from the central sacred section (Dan, Asher, Naphtali, and Gad), and therefore in the least privileged position, were descended from the four sons of Jacob by Zilpah and Bilhah, the maidservants of his wives, Leah and Rachel. The eight sons from Leah and Rachel would receive the strips immediately north and south of the holy portion that contained the Temple. Immediately next to the holy portion were the tribes of Benjamin and Judah<em>,</em> which historically surrounded Jerusalem. Judah received the strip immediately to the north of the holy portion, as if to stress that whereas in the past the land had been divided into north and south—Israel and Judah—now Judah would be in the north.</p>",

This special portion was devoted to God and was never to be sold or traded or used by others. It was made up of strips that ran from east to west and were allocated to the Levites, the priests, and the city. The area for the ordained priests immediately surrounded the Temple and protected it from anything unholy. It was flanked by an area to the north for the Levites.</p>",

Like the Temple, the city was a measured square with twelve gates, one for each of the tribes, which established a focus of tribal unity. Unusually, the three most important gates, named for Reuben (the oldest of the sons of Israel), Judah (the royal tribe), and Levi (the priestly tribe), faced north rather than east. This is because the most important direction was northward toward the Temple, the center of the renewed land. South was the second most important side because it was on the axis that pointed toward the Temple.</p>",

This also implied that the bloody city condemned in earlier chapters had now been replaced by a holy city, fit for God to dwell among representatives of all twelve of Israel’s tribes (cp. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa4:2-Isa4:6\">Isa 4:2–6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Zech14:20-Zech14:21\">Zech 14:20–21</a>).
