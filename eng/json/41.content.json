    "content": "<p>Mark opens with an introduction. This Gospel is about Jesus. With every account in Mark, one should ask, “What is Mark teaching about Jesus in this passage?” •&nbsp;Good News<em>,</em> a frequent term in Mark (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark1:14-Mark1:15\">1:14–15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark8:35\">8:35</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark10:29\">10:29</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark13:10\">13:10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark14:9\">14:9</a>), is frequently translated <em>gospel</em>. See <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"20359\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleStudyNotes\">study note on Mark 1:15</span>. •&nbsp;The Hebrew word mashiakh (Messiah) is equivalent to the Greek term christos (Christ). Both words mean “anointed.” In the Old Testament, priests (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod28:41\">Exod 28:41</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev16:32\">Lev 16:32</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev21:10\">21:10</a>), kings (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam1:14\">2&nbsp;Sam 1:14</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam1:16\">16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam19:21\">19:21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps2:1-Ps2:12\">Ps 2</a>), and prophets (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs19:16\">1&nbsp;Kgs 19:16</a>) were anointed with oil to indicate the Lord’s presence, blessing, and authority for the tasks to which God called them. As time went on, Israelites increasingly looked forward to the coming of the Messiah, “the Anointed One,” a descendant of David who would be Israel’s king. The first-century political connotations of this title were such that Jesus avoided openly declaring that he was the Messiah (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark3:11-Mark3:12\">Mark 3:11–12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark8:27-Mark8:30\">8:27–30</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark14:61-Mark14:63\">14:61–63</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark15:2\">15:2</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark15:26\">26</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John4:25-John4:26\">John 4:25–26</a>). •&nbsp;the Son of God: This title emphasizes Jesus’ unique relationship with God the Father (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark1:11\">Mark 1:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark9:7\">9:7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark12:4-Mark12:6\">12:4–6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark14:61-Mark14:62\">14:61–62</a>).</p>",

The Qumran community had an initiatory “baptism” which was repeated regularly, but John’s baptism was once for all. Jewish proselyte baptism has also been seen as a possible source, but it is more likely that such baptisms were not practiced until after John’s ministry.</p>",

In Jesus’ time, the Good News was the arrival of God’s reign through the Messiah. For Mark’s later audience, it was the news of Jesus’ death, resurrection, ascension, and promised return (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark15:1-Mark16:8\">15:1–16:8</a>). All people, Jews and Gentiles alike, need God’s forgiveness through repentance and faith in Jesus.</p>",

However, Mark then states that Jesus intended to go past them. Numerous attempts have been made to explain this, but the best explanation is that “to go past them” speaks of a divine manifestation (cp. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod33:18-Exod34:6\">Exod 33:18–34:6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs19:11-1Kgs19:13\">1&nbsp;Kgs 19:11–13</a>): Jesus apparently sought to show his divine glory to the disciples. This understanding is supported by the disciples’ fear, a response often associated with theophany. •&nbsp;Many have tried to rationalize the miracle of Jesus’ walking on the sea, but Mark, Matthew, and John clearly understood this as a miracle, beyond natural explanation.

Eating affects the digestive system, but moral issues involve the heart. The heart is a metaphor for the seat of moral decision making. How a person eats (with clean or unclean hands) or what a person eats (clean or unclean food) affects only the digestive tract, so it has no bearing on the moral issues of the soul. To help his later readers understand the implications of Jesus’ teaching, Mark adds the interpretive comment By saying this, he declared that every kind of food is acceptable in God’s eyes. In the apostolic church, Peter and Paul were instrumental in bringing this implication to light (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts10:1-Acts11:18\">Acts 10:1–11:18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom14:14\">Rom 14:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor8:8\">1&nbsp;Cor 8:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal2:11-Gal2:21\">Gal 2:11–21</a>).</p>",

If Jesus answered in agreement with John the Baptist, the Pharisees could indict him before Herod. But if Jesus said that divorce was lawful, he would be contradicting a prophet.</p>",

Entering the Kingdom of God requires repentance (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark1:15\">Mark 1:15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark6:12\">6:12</a>), and Jesus helped this man to understand exactly what repentance entailed for him. He did not need, as he might have thought, to attain a higher level of personal righteousness. He needed to enter God’s Kingdom through repentance and wholehearted love for God, thereby obtaining eternal life. He must deny himself (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark8:34\">8:34</a>) and love God first and foremost by giving away his money. For other commands involving a negative [sell all] and a positive [follow me] element, see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark1:15\">1:15</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark1:18\">18</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark1:20\">20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark10:28\">10:28</a>; see also <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts2:38\">Acts 2:38</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts20:21\">20:21</a>. •&nbsp;Jesus’ command to the rich man was not a universal requirement for entering the Kingdom of God but was addressed to his particular situation. It teaches anyone seeking eternal life that nothing else can come before God; repentance (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark1:15\">Mark 1:15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark6:12\">6:12</a>) requires the removal of anything that we place above God.</p>",

    "content": "<p>When they arrived back: Upon entering the Temple, Jesus was intensely disturbed by the buying and selling of sacrificial animals and by the exchange of money. It was supervised by priests, who alone could certify that a potential sacrificial offering was acceptable. The practice of selling sacrificial animals was meant to ensure that only blemish-free animals were used in the service of the Temple. It was facilitated by setting up exchange tables in areas around Jerusalem, but exchange tables were set up within the Temple itself on the fifteenth of Adar, the month before Passover. Usually the exchange rate involved a 4- to 8-percent commission. Because of the large number of half-shekels (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod30:11-Exod30:16\">Exod 30:11–16</a>) and sacrifices involved, the money exchange and the sale of sacrificial animals was quite profitable. Jewish literature of the time was intensely critical of the priests for accumulating great wealth by robbing the poor. Jesus was not opposed to the Temple nor attacking the sacrificial system (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark1:44\">Mark 1:44</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt5:17-Matt5:19\">Matt 5:17–19</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt5:23\">23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt17:24-Matt17:27\">17:24–27</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke17:14\">Luke 17:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts6:7\">Acts 6:7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts21:20-Acts21:26\">21:20–26</a>), but he viewed this profiteering as theft and as desecrating the holy place. •&nbsp;Jesus’ actions probably did not affect as large a number of people as is sometimes envisioned. These actions took place in one part of the large Court of the Gentiles and would not have been observed by most people in other parts of the Temple. The lack of interference by the Roman authorities suggests that they did not observe the event or did not regard it as a riot or as insurrection. Furthermore, at Jesus’ trial, this action is never mentioned. It was not a massive attempt to stop all such activity, but a symbolic act foretelling the judgment soon to befall the Temple and the city.</p>",

A similar question is asked: What do you suppose the owner of the vineyard will do? (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark12:9\">Mark 12:9</a>; cp. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa5:4\">Isa 5:4</a>). Isaiah specifically identifies the vineyard as the people of Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa5:7\">Isa 5:7</a>); Jesus’ hearers and Mark’s readers would similarly have understood the present story as an allegory about the Israelites. Other details in the story are also clearly meant to be interpreted allegorically: The tenants represent the leaders of Israel; the owner represents God; the servants represent the Old Testament prophets; the beloved son represents Jesus, the Son of God; the murder of the son represents Jesus’ crucifixion; and the giving of the vineyard to others represents the judgment coming upon Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark11:15-Mark11:17\">Mark 11:15–17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark13:1-Mark13:37\">13:1–37</a>). The interpretation would have been more clear to Mark’s readers than to Jesus’ original audience, but the religious leaders who were Jesus’ contemporaries understood it clearly enough that they sought to kill him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark12:12\">12:12</a>).</p>",

The first corresponds to what the “Lord of Heaven’s Armies” says in the parable of the vineyard (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa5:5-Isa5:7\">Isa 5:5–7</a>). Although some interpret Jesus’ answer as meaning that God would replace the evil Jewish leaders (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark11:27\">Mark 11:27</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark12:12\">12:12</a>) with more faithful ones, Mark’s readers likely would have understood the others to whom the vineyard would be given as the Gentile church (cp. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt21:43\">Matt 21:43</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom9:25-Rom9:33\">Rom 9:25–33</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom11:13-Rom11:24\">11:13–24</a>).

    "content": "<p>Jesus’ response had two elements. First, he rebuked the Sadducees’ ignorance of the Scriptures (i.e., the Old Testament), where the resurrection of the dead is referred to most clearly in the Prophets (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa26:19\">Isa 26:19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek37:1-Ezek37:14\">Ezek 37:1–14</a>) and the Writings (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job19:26\">Job 19:26</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps16:9-Ps16:11\">Pss 16:9–11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps49:15\">49:15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps73:23-Ps73:26\">73:23–26</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan12:2\">Dan 12:2</a>). However, the Sadducees accepted only the Torah (Genesis—Deuteronomy), so Jesus answered them from the Torah. The reference to God as the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod3:6\">Exod 3:6</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod3:15-Exod3:16\">15–16</a>) showed that God’s covenant with the patriarchs could not be broken by death. They were still alive (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt8:11-Matt8:12\">Matt 8:11–12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt13:17\">13:17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke16:19-Luke16:31\">Luke 16:19–31</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John8:56\">John 8:56</a>), for God is the God of the living, not the dead. God’s covenant relationship with his people extends beyond their physical death, which means that the afterlife must be a reality. •&nbsp;Second, Jesus challenged the Sadducees’ ignorance of God’s power. They thought that life in the resurrection would have to be an extension of mortal life. Instead, it is life raised to an entirely new level. In this new existence, there is no need for sexual reproduction because there is no more death. The intimacy of marriage is superseded by fellowship with a multitude of fellow believers and with God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark10:29-Mark10:30\">Mark 10:29–30</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt19:28-Matt19:29\">Matt 19:28–29</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke18:29-Luke18:30\">Luke 18:29–30</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev21:1-Rev21:4\">Rev 21:1–4</a>). It is in this respect that resurrected believers will be like the angels in heaven. •&nbsp;Jesus’ argument demonstrates his wisdom before his opponents and affirms the hope of the resurrection for his followers. Jesus is “the resurrection and the life” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John11:25\">John 11:25</a>); he has conquered death and assured those who believe in him that they will “not perish but have eternal life” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John3:16\">John 3:16</a>).</p>",

    "content": "<p>Jesus’ reply combined two widely separated commands from the Torah. •&nbsp;The first, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut6:4-Deut6:5\">Deut 6:4–5</a>, was probably the best known passage in the Old Testament, for it was repeated twice daily by observant Jews. It is called the <em>Shema</em> because it begins with the word Listen (Hebrew shema‘). The first command corresponds to the first part of the Ten Commandments (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod20:2-Exod20:11\">Exod 20:2–11</a>), which deals with a person’s relationship to God. •&nbsp;The oneness of God is foundational to Jewish and Christian monotheism and is the basis for the command to love God with all one’s heart (thinking and affection), soul (desire and feeling), mind (understanding), and strength (energy and power). •&nbsp;The second command is from <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev19:18\">Lev 19:18</a>. It corresponds to the second part of the Ten Commandments (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod20:12-Exod20:17\">Exod 20:12–17</a>), which concerns a person’s relationship with other people. The second command is based on the natural inclination of people to look after themselves. Its importance to the early church can be seen in its frequent repetition (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt5:43-Matt5:44\">Matt 5:43–44</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt19:19\">19:19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt25:31-Matt25:46\">25:31–46</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom13:8-Rom13:10\">Rom 13:8–10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal5:14\">Gal 5:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jas2:8\">Jas 2:8</a>; <em>Didache</em> 1.2; 2.7). The two commands are not independent, but are intimately associated as one commandment. Their integration precludes religious mysticism that addresses only a person’s relationship with God or humanism that addresses only human relationships.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The day is coming when you will see the sacrilegious object that causes desecration: Mark did not explain what this object would be, but Jewish readers in the first century were familiar with the term. The prophet Daniel had foretold that such an object would stand in the Temple in Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan9:27\">Dan 9:27</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan11:31\">11:31</a>), and many Jews understood the events in Jerusalem in 167–164&nbsp;BC, during the time of Antiochus&nbsp;IV Epiphanes, to be a fulfillment of that prophecy. (The deuterocanonical book of <em>1&nbsp;Maccabees,</em> written about 100&nbsp;BC, narrates Antiochus’s reign and describes how Antiochus and his followers erected a “sacrilegious object causing desecration on top of the altar for burnt offerings,” <em>1&nbsp;Maccabees</em> 1:54, 59). •&nbsp;standing where he should not be: In light of the historical background and the reference to Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark13:2\">Mark 13:2</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark13:4\">4</a>) and Judea (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark13:14\">13:14</a>), this clause clearly refers to something inappropriate happening in the Temple in Jerusalem. •&nbsp;(Reader, pay attention!): Mark alerted his original readers to pay attention to his description of this sign, which indicates that the expression required careful thought and discernment. Mark’s readers were to look for a sign that was similar to what had happened in the time of Antiochus Epiphanes. •&nbsp;Although the phrase <em>sacrilegious object that causes desecration</em> is grammatically neuter, the word <em>standing</em> is grammatically masculine, so it refers to a person and not a thing. Suggestions as to who it might have been include: (1)&nbsp;the emperor Caligula, who in AD&nbsp;39–40 attempted to erect a statue of himself in the Temple (Josephus, <em>Antiquities</em> 12.8.2–3); (2)&nbsp;Pontius Pilate (AD&nbsp;26–36), who attempted to have the Roman soldiers march into Judea displaying their standards, which were considered idolatrous by Jews (Josephus, <em>War</em> 2.9.2–3); (3)&nbsp;the Zealots in AD&nbsp;69–70, when they committed atrocities in the Temple, appointed an unqualified person as the high priest of the nation, and “came into the sanctuary with polluted feet” (Josephus, <em>War</em> 4.3.4–8); (4)&nbsp;the Roman general Titus, who after conquering Jerusalem in AD&nbsp;70 forced entry into the Temple as well (Josephus, <em>War</em> 6.4.7); (5)&nbsp;Titus’s soldiers, who set up their standards in the Temple, sacrificed to them, and proclaimed Titus as emperor (Josephus, <em>War</em> 6.6.1); (6)&nbsp;the destruction of the Temple itself in AD&nbsp;70; or (7)&nbsp;a future event involving the coming of the antichrist (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess2:3-2Thess2:4\">2&nbsp;Thes 2:3–4</a>). The context and source of the expression eliminate several of these theories. In Daniel and <em>1&nbsp;Maccabees,</em> the expression involves the Temple, its altar, and its sacrificial rituals. In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark13:14-Mark13:20\">Mark 13:14–20</a>, it is a sign for people to flee Judea, and what it refers to must occur while there is still time to flee (i.e., before the Roman army had occupied Judea and besieged Jerusalem). Explanations 1 and 2 are too early to serve as a recognizable sign to flee Judea, they didn’t actually defile the Temple, and the Christians did not flee Jerusalem. Explanations <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark4:1-Mark6:56\">4–6</a> occurred too late, for there would have been no opportunity to flee after Titus entered Jerusalem. Explanation 7 does not refer to the destruction of Jerusalem in AD&nbsp;70, which is the subject of <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark13:14-Mark13:20\">13:14–20</a>, and the coming of the antichrist would not be limited to Judea. Explanation 3, however, fits well: It occurred in AD&nbsp;69–70, shortly before Titus besieged Jerusalem, which would have given Christians a brief opportunity to leave Jerusalem before it was besieged; and it involved actions that defiled the holy place in the Temple. This interpretation also helps to distinguish the sign of the coming disaster (the sacrilegious person) from the disaster itself (the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple). •&nbsp;Then: At the appearance of the sacrilege, those in Judea were to flee to the hills. The early church historian Eusebius tells of a prophetic oracle given to the Jerusalem church that caused them to flee the city before its destruction (Eusebius, <em>Church History</em> 3.5.3).</p>",

Along with false messiahs, prophets would appear and perform miraculous signs and wonders (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark13:22\">13:22</a>), hoping to deceive not only the Jews of Judea and Jerusalem but even the Christians (God’s chosen ones). Jesus warned his followers not to believe such reports. When the Messiah comes from heaven (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark13:26\">13:26</a>), everyone will see and know it (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev1:7\">Rev 1:7</a>). •&nbsp;Watch out! This warning unifies the section (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark13:5-Mark13:23\">Mark 13:5–23</a>) and brings it to a close. Jesus’ teaching in this section was to warn his followers in Judea and Jerusalem not to be misled by false messianic hopes and claims. Many Jews succumbed to such claims in the late AD&nbsp;60s, and Josephus (<em>Antiquities</em> 17.10.8) describes the great harm done by these pretenders, who encouraged the Jewish people to resist the Romans. Nothing should distract Christians from fleeing Judea and Jerusalem when they see the sacrilegious object that causes desecration taking place. •&nbsp;For Mark’s readers in Rome, Jesus’ message had a different application. Mark wanted his readers to watch out for those who promised timetables for prophecy to be fulfilled. They could not know the time (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark13:32\">13:32</a>), and a frenzy about the second coming of Christ was forbidden, but they were to be alert (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark13:33-Mark13:37\">13:33–37</a>) and prepare themselves for persecution (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark13:9-Mark13:13\">13:9–13</a>; see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark8:34-Mark8:38\">8:34–38</a>) according to Jesus’ words of encouragement (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark13:11\">13:11</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark13:13\">13</a>).</p>",

The traditional interpretation, though, is that, whereas the former material refers to the destruction of Jerusalem, this passage refers to the coming of the Son of Man (the <em>parousia</em>) that will occur at the end of history. This interpretation fits better for several reasons: (1)&nbsp;After the anguish of those days means after the destruction of Jerusalem, not during it, and at that time (literally <em>in those days</em>) could occur at any time after the events of <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark13:5-Mark13:23\">13:5–23</a>; (2)&nbsp;several words used in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark13:26\">13:26</a> are used elsewhere to describe the coming of the Son of Man: glory (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark8:38\">8:38</a>), power and clouds (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark14:62\">14:62</a>); and (3)&nbsp;in light of the early church’s longing and praying for the return of the Lord Jesus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor16:22\">1&nbsp;Cor 16:22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev22:20\">Rev 22:20</a>), Mark’s readers would have interpreted <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark13:26\">Mark 13:26</a> as the second coming of Jesus, which will bring history as we know it to a close. The prophets, Jesus, and the Gospel writers described this event as though seen through a telescope, and the distance between events is unclear; no one knows the time for this event except God himself (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark13:32\">13:32</a>).

In modern practice, Christians ask God to bless the food; Jews in Jesus’ day blessed God for providing the food with the words, “Blessed are you, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who brings forth bread from the earth.” •&nbsp;this is my body. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This is my blood: Some understand these words to mean that the bread and wine are transformed into the very body and blood of Jesus (<em>transubstantiation</em>); others, that the bread and wine remain bread and wine but that the real presence of Jesus is found in them (<em>consubstantiation</em>). In these two views, when one participates in the Lord’s Supper, one actually eats and drinks the body and blood of Jesus. A third view is that in eating the bread and wine, Christians spiritually feed on Jesus. A fourth view is that the meal is primarily a memorial, and the elements are symbolic of Jesus’ sacrifice on our behalf.

The rest of the Sanhedrin agreed that Jesus was guilty and deserved to die. •&nbsp;Exactly what was blasphemous in Jesus’ reply is unclear. Perhaps it was his reply “I Am,” which was the way God referred to himself in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod3:14\">Exod 3:14</a> (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John8:58\">John 8:58</a>).

He was the Messiah, the Son of God. During the second Jewish revolt against Rome, Bar Kokhba (AD&nbsp;132–135) claimed to be the Messiah, and it was not considered blasphemous. Jesus’ identification of himself as the Son of Man cannot have been considered blasphemous, for we have over fifty instances before Jesus’ trial in which he used this title, and the charge of blasphemy was never raised. Yet it was too much for the high priest and the Sanhedrin when Jesus clearly claimed to be the Son of Man of <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan7:13\">Dan 7:13</a> coming in God’s name to judge the world. This declaration was also added to the fact that, during his ministry, Jesus forgave sins (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark2:5-Mark2:7\">Mark 2:5–7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke7:48-Luke7:50\">Luke 7:48–50</a>), claimed to be the Son of God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark12:6\">Mark 12:6</a>), pronounced judgment upon the Temple (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark14:58\">14:58</a>), and claimed to be Lord of the Sabbath (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark2:28\">2:28</a>).

However, there is reason to doubt that Mark intended to end his Gospel at <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark16:8\">16:8</a>: (1)&nbsp;Mark emphasizes the fulfillment of Jesus’ predictions throughout his Gospel, and if the Gospel ended with <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark16:8\">16:8</a>, there would be no reference to the resurrection appearance(s) of Jesus; (2)&nbsp;all the other Gospels contain accounts of Jesus’ appearances to the women and the disciples; (3)&nbsp;early readers of Mark evidently did not think the book could have ended with <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark16:8\">16:8</a>, because they wrote these endings; (4)&nbsp;there is no convincing explanation as to why Mark would have wanted to end his Gospel at <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark16:8\">16:8</a> (all such explanations sound like modern existential literary interpretations that revel in paradox, very unlike the way a first-century Christian author would have thought); (5)&nbsp;it is strange for a Gospel to begin with a bold proclamation that Jesus is the Messiah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark1:1\">1:1</a>) and end with the women’s fear; (6)&nbsp;it would be unique for an ancient Greek book to end with gar (“because”) as the last word—no other example of this has been found; and (7)&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark16:7\">16:7</a> raises the expectation that the disciples will meet Jesus in Galilee—if <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark16:8\">16:8</a> was the original ending of Mark, it is the only unfulfilled prediction in the Gospel. Many scholars conclude that the original ending was accidentally torn off and lost, or was never finished.</p>",
