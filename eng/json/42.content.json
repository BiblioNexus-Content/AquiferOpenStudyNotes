Different theories identify him as (1)&nbsp;an influential unbeliever, (2)&nbsp;a new convert needing instruction, (3)&nbsp;the judge overseeing Paul’s trial (the book of Acts ends with Paul imprisoned in Rome, awaiting trial), or (4)&nbsp;the patron who sponsored Luke’s writing project.

The Pharisees were apparently challenging Jesus’ claim to be the Messiah because he was not defeating the Romans or establishing his Kingdom physically on earth. Jesus did not reject this future manifestation of the Kingdom (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke21:27\">Luke 21:27</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt24:30-Matt24:31\">Matt 24:30–31</a>) but pointed out that the Kingdom of God was being revealed to them through his ministry, though they were missing it. •&nbsp;The Kingdom of God can’t be detected by visible signs: Jewish apocalyptic literature of Jesus’ day looked for visible signs in the heavens to signal the coming of the Messiah’s kingdom. Jesus elsewhere affirmed that such signs would appear (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke17:24\">Luke 17:24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke21:25\">21:25</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts2:19-Acts2:20\">Acts 2:19–20</a>), but the Pharisees were missing the manifestation of the Kingdom in Jesus’ immediate ministry (cp. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke7:22\">Luke 7:22</a>). •&nbsp;the Kingdom of God is already among you (or <em>is within you,</em> or <em>is in your grasp</em>): The Kingdom of God was already being revealed through Jesus’ words and actions.
