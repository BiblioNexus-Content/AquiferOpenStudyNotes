A vision that did not come from the Lord was false (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer14:14\">Jer 14:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer23:16\">23:16</a>), the ultimate proof being its lack of fulfillment (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek12:22-Ezek12:24\">Ezek 12:22–24</a>).

Prophetic visions came in various forms (dreams, extrasensory experiences; e.g., <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan8:2\">Dan 8:2</a>). The absence of visions is a mark of divine abandonment (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lam2:9\">Lam 2:9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek7:26\">Ezek 7:26</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mic3:6\">Mic 3:6</a>). •&nbsp;Sovereign Lord is one of several names for the God of Israel. •&nbsp;Obadiah was a common Hebrew name that meant “servant of the Lord.” The prophet Obadiah is unknown apart from this book. •&nbsp;an ambassador was sent to the nations: In ancient warfare, allies would be contacted about joining a military coalition to punish an enemy or defend against attack. Here the Sovereign Lord calls the nations to redress Edom’s evil pride. •&nbsp;Let’s assemble: This is a willing coalition, though ironically, they will be punished later for their own evil deeds (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Obad1:15-Obad1:16\">Obad 1:15–16</a>).</p>",
