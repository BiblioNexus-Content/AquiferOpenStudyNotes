    "content": "<p>Epicurean .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. philosophers: Epicureanism was a popular school of Greek philosophy, founded by Epicurus (341–270&nbsp;BC). Epicureans believed that the principal aim of life was to secure happiness. They thought of pleasure not in terms of sensual indulgence, as their critics charged, but in terms of tranquility. Their contemporaries often called them atheists; in their view, there were no gods to fear, and death simply marked the end of human existence. They sought their security in organized communities where they could live in contentment apart from society. •&nbsp;Stoic philosophers: Stoicism was founded by Zeno of Citium (335–263&nbsp;BC) and became the most influential philosophy in the Greco-Roman world. It viewed the universe as permeated by Reason (sometimes referred to as God or Providence). Stoicism saw divine Reason as expressed in human reason and held that as humans made progress, they could advance from ignorance (the source of vice) to true knowledge (the source of virtue). They developed extensive lists of virtues and vices and produced detailed household codes to guide family behavior. Paul’s teaching resembles that of the Stoics in his use of household codes and lists of virtues and vices (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal5:19-Gal5:23\">Gal 5:19–23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph5:22-Eph5:33\">Eph 5:22–33</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Col3:18-Col4:1\">Col 3:18–4:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Tim3:1-1Tim3:13\">1&nbsp;Tim 3:1–13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Tim5:1-1Tim5:6\">5:1–6:1</a>). However, Paul’s message of Good News—focusing on the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ—was strange and foreign to these Greek philosophers. •&nbsp;The air of superiority with which they addressed Paul as this babbler indicates their arrogance.</p>",

While Paul’s Greek audience did not know the Scriptures or have a tradition of monotheism as the Jews did, they did have a rich intellectual heritage. So Paul established a point of contact on the basis of an Athenian inscription to an Unknown God. He then explained God’s nature as the Creator (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts17:22-Acts17:29\">17:22–29</a>), followed by God’s purpose as the Redeemer (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts17:30-Acts17:31\">17:30–31</a>). •&nbsp;As he did elsewhere in his own writings (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor15:33\">1&nbsp;Cor 15:33</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Titus1:12\">Titus 1:12</a>), Paul made use of the Greek poets. There are several points of connection in this sermon with the <em>Hymn to Zeus</em> by Cleanthes (about 315–240&nbsp;BC). Paul was probably quoting Epimenides, who had declared about God, “In him we live and move and exist” (Epimenides, <em>Cretica,</em> about 600&nbsp;BC). Paul also cited Aratus, a Stoic poet from Cilicia (about 315–240&nbsp;BC), who had commented, “We are his offspring” (Aratus, <em>Phaenomena</em> 5). These allusions to their own poets established connections with his audience. Paul was then able to present the singular nature of God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts17:29\">Acts 17:29</a>), and he stressed the coming judgment through Jesus Christ, whom God had raised from the dead. This message, while touching on Greek culture and philosophy, had a clear focus on Christ that presented the challenge of Christ to a cultured and intellectual but idolatrous people.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Despite being under house arrest (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts28:16\">28:16</a>), Paul boldly proclaimed the Kingdom message. •&nbsp;And no one tried to stop him (Greek akōlutōs, “without hindrance”): This single word in Greek is the last word of the book of Acts and one of the keys to its meaning: God’s word cannot be chained, even when its messengers are (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim2:9\">2&nbsp;Tim 2:9</a>; see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Phil1:12-Phil1:14\">Phil 1:12–14</a>). Acts is the story of an unhindered message of Good News, available to all people throughout the world, whether Jew, Gentile, proselyte, rich, or poor. The mission of proclaiming this message is accomplished in the power of the Spirit (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts1:8\">Acts 1:8</a>); it embraces Jews (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts3:1-Acts5:42\">3:1–5:42</a>), Samaritans (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts8:1-Acts8:25\">8:1–25</a>), converts to Judaism (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts2:11\">2:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts13:43\">13:43</a>), “God-fearers” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts8:26-Acts8:40\">8:26–40</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts9:32-Acts11:18\">9:32–11:18</a>), and Gentiles (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts13:1-Acts28:28\">13:1–28:28</a>). •&nbsp;Luke ends his account with Paul still under house arrest in Rome (about AD&nbsp;60–62). Paul was later released and traveled freely. According to tradition, Paul was imprisoned again in Rome about AD&nbsp;64 and was martyred there during Nero’s persecution of believers.</p>",
