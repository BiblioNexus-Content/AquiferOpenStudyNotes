Eventually, Babylon would also face God&apos;s judgment (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer50:1-Jer51:64\">Jeremiah 50–51</a>). These chapters were likely written while Jeremiah and Baruch were in hiding (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer36:27-Jer36:32\">Jeremiah 36:27–32</a>). Among the warnings of doom for the foreign nations&apos; sins are a few statements offering hope for salvation. Collections of oracles against the nations are also found in Isaiah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa13:1-Isa23:18\">Isaiah 13–23</a>) and Ezekiel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek25:1-Ezek32:32\">Ezekiel 25–32</a>).
