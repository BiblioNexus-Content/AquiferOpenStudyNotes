The historical circumstances surrounding this event can be interpreted in two ways: (1)&nbsp;Some see ch <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa6:1-Isa6:13\">6</a> as Isaiah’s original call to ministry, meaning that chs <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa1:1-Isa5:30\">1–5</a> and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa7:1-Isa12:6\">7–12</a> fit into the reign of Ahaz, who came to rule after the death of Uzziah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa6:1\">6:1</a>). If this were so, why was Isaiah’s call not at the beginning of the book? Perhaps his call was put in ch <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa6:1-Isa6:13\">6</a> for literary reasons, serving as a conclusion to chs <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa1:1-Isa5:30\">1–5</a> and an introduction to chs <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa7:1-Isa12:6\">7–12</a>. The prophet’s own transformation and commissioning symbolizes the entire nation’s need for conversion if it wants to fulfill its mandate to be God’s light to the world. (2)&nbsp;Others understand chs <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa1:1-Isa12:6\">1–12</a> as chronological; Isaiah’s call in ch <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa6:1-Isa6:13\">6</a> would then serve as a recommissioning of the prophet to minister in a new way in a different period (the time of Ahaz) when his words would be rejected. Those who hold this interpretation point to <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa2:7-Isa2:9\">2:7–9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa3:16-Isa3:24\">3:16–24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa5:8-Isa5:14\">and 5:8–14</a>, contending that these passages reflect a time of prosperity, military strength, pride, and splendor; these conditions existed during Uzziah’s reign but not during Ahaz’s reign.</p>",

The relationship between Judah and Tyre went back to the time of David and Solomon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs5:8-1Kgs5:9\">1&nbsp;Kgs 5:8–9</a>). Tyre, with its proximity to plentiful forests and to the Mediterranean Sea, was one of the commercial centers of the ancient Near East. Its fleets were renowned, and its colonies brought it great prestige and riches. The city came under repeated attack by the Assyrians, Babylonians, and Macedonians, and it fell to Alexander the Great in 332&nbsp;BC. Isaiah not only prophesied the end of Tyre but by implication warned all whose wealth and earthly securities lead to pride instead of dependence on God (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa2:12-Isa2:16\">Isa 2:12–16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt11:21\">Matt 11:21</a>).</p>",

That means that these chapters cannot be used to outline a sequence of events or create a historical blueprint for the future. Instead, the imagery is intended to create an impressionistic drama of an unfolding world that is both like and unlike the present. The combination of aspects of the old era with aspects of the new era (for instance, people of Zion will all be righteous [new], but still long for their redemption [old]) is consistent with the New Testament concept of the future age breaking into and overlapping with the present evil age (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor4:4\">2&nbsp;Cor 4:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal1:4\">Gal 1:4</a>).

Hezekiah responded by attempting to appease Sennacherib (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs18:14-2Kgs18:16\">2&nbsp;Kgs 18:14–16</a>), but it was too late.</p>",

Hezekiah had learned the lesson of trust that his father, Ahaz, refused. As a result, Judah and Jerusalem were spared total destruction by the Assyrians. Yet Hezekiah was not the Messiah, the Son of David promised in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa7:14\">7:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa9:1-Isa9:7\">9:1–7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa11:1-Isa11:16\">11:1–16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa16:5\">16:5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa32:1\">32:1</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa33:17-Isa33:22\">and 33:17–22</a>.
