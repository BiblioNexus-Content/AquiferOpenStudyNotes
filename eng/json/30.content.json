Amos describes his vocation in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Amos7:14\">Amos 7:14</a> using a different Hebrew word (boqer, which means “herder”; see <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"Amos_BookIntro_Filament\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleStudyNotes\">Amos Book Introduction</span>, “The Prophet Amos”). Amos was not a professional prophet serving the court or the Temple. •&nbsp;Amos received this message in visions—that is, by divine revelation (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa1:1\">Isa 1:1</a>). •&nbsp;Amos depicts the earthquake that occurred during the reign of Uzziah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Zech14:5\">Zech 14:5</a>) as an act of God’s judgment (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Amos3:14-Amos3:15\">Amos 3:14–15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Amos6:11\">6:11</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Amos6:14\">14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Amos8:8\">8:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Amos9:1\">9:1</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Amos9:9\">9</a>). •&nbsp;Uzziah, also called Azariah (792–740&nbsp;BC), was the most powerful king of Judah after the division of the kingdom. •&nbsp;Jeroboam&nbsp;II (793–753&nbsp;BC), who descended from the dynasty of Jehu, took advantage of a power vacuum in the region and recovered territory earlier lost to the Arameans.</p>",

Here, the phrase is probably a name for God, who is the legitimate object of Israel’s pride. Elsewhere (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps47:4\">Ps 47:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Nah2:2\">Nah 2:2</a>), this phrase refers to the Promised Land under a king from David’s line (cp. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer13:9\">Jer 13:9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek32:12\">Ezek 32:12</a>). If the phrase here means the land, it would spotlight Israel’s perverse pride in its national and geographic identity.</p>",
