These oxen faced in four directions, three per direction, possibly symbolizing the priests&apos; service to all twelve tribes of Israel. Later, Ahaz replaced the oxen with a stone base (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs16:17\">2&nbsp;Kings 16:17</a>). Like the earlier washbasin, priests used the Sea for ceremonial washing (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr4:6\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 4:6</a>) as they prepared to serve God (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod30:17-Exod30:21\">Exodus 30:17–21</a>). The difference in its water capacity (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr4:5\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 4:5</a>) likely comes from varying measurement standards over time and place.</p>",
