He may also be referring to God’s call at the time of his Damascus Road conversion (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts9:15-Acts9:16\">Acts 9:15–16</a>; cp. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts13:2\">Acts 13:2</a>), to preach the Good News to Jews and especially to Gentiles. •&nbsp;The Good News, or “gospel,” is a recurrent topic in the opening of the letter (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom1:1\">Rom 1:1</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom1:9\">9</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom1:15\">15</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom1:16\">16</a>).

    "content": "<p>the sacrifice for sin (Greek hilastērion): This Greek word is used in the Greek Old Testament to refer to the “atonement cover,” the cover that rested on the Ark of the Covenant in the inner sanctuary of the Tabernacle. The atonement cover was prominent in the Day of Atonement ritual (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev16:1-Lev16:34\">Lev 16</a>) and came to stand for the atonement ceremony itself. Paul characterizes Jesus Christ as God’s provision of final atonement for his people. Jesus himself satisfies, or absorbs in himself, the anger of God against all sinful people (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom1:18\">Rom 1:18</a>). •&nbsp;those who sinned in times past: Paul refers to righteous Old Testament people who were not punished for their sins as strict justice would require. Hebrews reminds us, “it is not possible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb10:4\">Heb 10:4</a>). How, then, could God forgive people in the Old Testament? Paul answers that Jesus’ sacrifice works backward in history as well as forward—through Christ, God provided for the full satisfaction of his righteous anger against human sin.</p>",
