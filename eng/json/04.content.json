Today, things like skin diseases, bodily discharges, or contact with a dead body are viewed mainly as health concerns.

Nothing unclean could touch what belonged to the Lord (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num5:2-Num5:3\">Numbers 5:2–3</a>). They had to choose between having God in the camp or allowing a ceremonially polluted person stay.

Here, the Gershonites and Merarites carried the components of the Tabernacle structure between Judah and Reuben, and the Kohathites carried the most sacred furniture between Reuben and Ephraim. This useful arrangement allowed time for the Gershonites and Merarites to set up the Tabernacle before the Kohathites arrived with the sacred objects. It also provided security for their special cargo, and it spread the Levites out among the tribes, perhaps enhancing the leavening effect of their influence (cp. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt13:33\">Matt 13:33</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt16:6\">16:6</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt16:11-Matt16:12\">11–12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor5:6-1Cor5:7\">1&nbsp;Cor 5:6–7</a>).</p>",

    "content": "<p>The Promised Land is often described as a land flowing with milk and honey. Milk and dairy products constituted a major part of the diet in biblical times, and “milk” is used in figurative language for abundance (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut32:14\">Deut 32:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa55:1\">Isa 55:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Joel3:18\">Joel 3:18</a>). Honey provided sweetness (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps19:10\">Pss 19:10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps119:103\">119:103</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek3:3\">Ezek 3:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev10:9-Rev10:10\">Rev 10:9–10</a>). The phrase thus refers to a highly desirable destination, a land with an abundance of food and resources (cp. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num16:13-Num16:14\">Num 16:13–14</a>; see also <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod3:8\">Exod 3:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut6:3\">Deut 6:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut26:15\">26:15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer11:4-Jer11:5\">Jer 11:4–5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek20:6\">Ezek 20:6</a>). The New Testament emphasizes the spiritual nature of God’s promises, pointing to a promised inheritance in heaven (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom9:6-Rom9:8\">Rom 9:6–8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal6:14-Gal6:16\">Gal 6:14–16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev21:1-Rev21:2\">Rev 21:1–2</a>).</p>",

Ancient <em>Arad</em> is usually identified with Tell Arad, located west of the modern Israeli town of Arad and about fifty miles north of Kadesh. While excavation at Tell Arad has revealed important ruins from the Early Bronze Age (about 3300–2000&nbsp;BC) and the Iron Age (about 1200–500&nbsp;BC), there is no evidence of occupation during Israel’s exodus and wilderness period (the Late Bronze Age, 1500–1200&nbsp;BC). Some solutions link ancient Arad with another archaeological site in the region. Others claim that all such stories come from a much later period and that there is no reason to expect a correlation between excavated data and literary traditions. Another set of solutions recognizes that the evidence is fragmentary, insufficient to settle scholarly debate or to reach a definitive conclusion. The same general kinds of problems with geographical and archaeological details are found in other parts of the Old Testament, and the solutions are often uncertain. • Atharim is otherwise unknown.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Balaam was a pagan religious specialist (a <em>diviner</em>) from northwest Mesopotamia (see “<span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"203416\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleStudyNotesProfiles\">Balaam</span>” Profile). Like other ancient peoples, Moab and Midian believed that the spoken word—in the form of a blessing or curse—was powerful when uttered by a skilled diviner. Members of this trained profession claimed to possess special powers to learn about and manipulate the future course of events (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut18:14\">Deut 18:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam6:2\">1&nbsp;Sam 6:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs21:6\">2&nbsp;Kgs 21:6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa44:25\">Isa 44:25</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan2:1-Dan2:12\">Dan 2:1–12</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan2:27-Dan2:28\">27–28</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mic5:12\">Mic 5:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Zech10:2\">Zech 10:2</a>). Israel’s enemies appealed to Balaam to pronounce curses upon the Hebrews, for they believed that such spoken words would be effective against them. Ancient armies pronounced such curses on their enemies before they entered battle. Belief in the power of the spoken word was common in ancient Israel even when not linked with divination (e.g., <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen27:1-Gen27:40\">Gen 27:1–40</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut27:15-Deut27:26\">Deut 27:15–26</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam14:24-1Sam14:28\">1&nbsp;Sam 14:24–28</a>; cp. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt21:18-Matt21:22\">Matt 21:18–22</a>). •&nbsp;Pethor (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num22:5\">Num 22:5</a>) is probably ancient Pitru, located on the west side of the Euphrates River south of Carchemish, 400 miles from Moab.</p>",

His leadership helped to define this engagement as “holy war,” an act of revenge for the spiritual harm that Midian had inflicted on Israel (cp. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num25:6-Num25:18\">25:6–18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num31:15-Num31:16\">31:15–16</a>). His zeal in this situation (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num25:11\">Num 25:11</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num25:13\">13</a>) was equal to what he demonstrated in the case of Zimri and Cozbi (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num25:7-Num25:8\">25:7–8</a>). •&nbsp;Many believe that holy objects of the sanctuary meant the Ark, which the Hebrews sometimes carried into battle (e.g., <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num10:35-Num10:36\">10:35–36</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh6:6\">Josh 6:6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam4:3-1Sam4:11\">1&nbsp;Sam 4:3–11</a>; cp. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num14:44\">Num 14:44</a>).

Just as the forty-eight Levite towns were widely distributed across Israel’s territories, the six cities of refuge were dispersed so they would be widely accessible (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh20:7-Josh20:8\">Josh 20:7–8</a>). These designated settlements supplemented the role of the altar as a temporary place of asylum (e.g., <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:50-1Kgs1:53\">1&nbsp;Kgs 1:50–53</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:28-1Kgs2:34\">2:28–34</a>; cp. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod21:14\">Exod 21:14</a>).
