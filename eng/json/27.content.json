    "content": "<p>Many understand the period of seventy sets of seven as seventy “weeks of years”—i.e., 490 years. However, they are not called “years” in the Hebrew text, and it has proven difficult to assign this period to an actual historical period of 490 years. Therefore, many interpreters believe that the numbers are not intended as calendar years but as symbolic periods of time to fulfill the visions. Just as Jerusalem suffered a lifetime of desolation (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan9:2\">9:2</a>; see <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"16922\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleStudyNotes\">study note on Jer 25:11</span>), the city would experience many lifetimes of restoration. •&nbsp;The period of time was for your people (the Jews) and your holy city (Jerusalem). The six purposes listed here appear to refer to the restoration of the Jews and the city of Jerusalem. Other interpreters see these six purposes as representing God’s universal work of redemption in the world. •&nbsp;God would finish the rebellion of the Israelites, and he would also finish the rebellions of human rulers who defy the Lord and attack the holy people (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan7:8\">Dan 7:8</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan7:22\">22</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan7:25-Dan7:26\">25–26</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan8:13-Dan8:14\">8:13–14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan11:29-Dan11:45\">11:29–45</a>). •&nbsp;To confirm the prophetic vision means to fulfill the content of the visionary answer to Daniel’s prayer. •&nbsp;the Most Holy Place (Or <em>the Most Holy One;</em> literally <em>a most holy</em>): Some interpreters see this as referring to the restored Most Holy Place in the Temple in 164&nbsp;BC. Others see it as referring to the anointing of Christ and his church as God’s own temple (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt12:6\">Matt 12:6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph2:19-Eph2:22\">Eph 2:19–22</a>).</p>",

However, an “anointed one” can refer to any of Israel’s kings or priests, who were ordained by anointing with oil. If the passage was fulfilled in the time of Antiochus&nbsp;IV, then the anointed one was probably the high priest at the time, Onias&nbsp;III (cp. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan11:22\">Dan 11:22</a>). •&nbsp;and strong defenses: The vision refers to Jerusalem as being physically rebuilt. The rebuilding of the Temple was completed in 515&nbsp;BC (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra3:1-Ezra6:22\">Ezra 3:1–6:22</a>); in 445&nbsp;BC, Nehemiah completed the wall of Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh2:1-Neh6:19\">Neh 2–6</a>). •&nbsp;The perilous times can refer to the history of Jerusalem and its Temple from the time the decree was published until the end of the seventy sets of seven (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan11:2-Dan11:45\">Dan 11:2–45</a>).</p>",

    "content": "<p>The ruler (literally <em>he</em>): Most interpreters understand this pronoun as referring to the ruler of <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan9:26\">9:26</a>. Some think that it refers back to the anointed one of <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan9:25-Dan9:26\">9:25–26</a> and is thus a prophecy about Christ, meaning that Christ caused a covenant to prevail and removed the need for sacrifices and offerings by his death. However, the word behind make a treaty has the sense of imposing a covenant, evidently by the use of force or intimidation. Antiochus&nbsp;IV imposed a covenant with the people of Judea following the beginning of his rule in 175&nbsp;BC (cp. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan11:23\">11:23</a>; see <em>1&nbsp;Maccabees</em> 1:10–15). Other interpreters believe that this prophecy was fulfilled in the events of AD&nbsp;66–70. For still others, it refers to a future ruler. •&nbsp;The phrase put an end refers to a destructive action, not an act of God’s salvation such as the Messiah would accomplish by his death. In 167&nbsp;BC, Antiochus&nbsp;IV ordered the people of Judea to cease all practice of Jewish worship in the Temple and instead practice pagan worship, on pain of death (see <em>1&nbsp;Maccabees</em> 1:41–63). Similarly, the Roman general Titus put an end to the sacrifices and offerings in the Temple when he destroyed it in AD&nbsp;70. •&nbsp;a sacrilegious object that causes desecration (literally <em>an abomination of desolation</em>): Cp. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan8:13\">Dan 8:13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan11:31\">11:31</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan12:11\">12:11</a>. This expression (Hebrew shiqqutsim meshomem) is possibly a mocking play on the Semitic name for Zeus (<em>Ba‘al Shamayim</em>, “Lord of the Heavens”). Idol-gods are often referred to as <em>shiqquts,</em> “abomination,” “desolation,” elsewhere in the Bible (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut29:17\">Deut 29:17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr15:8\">2&nbsp;Chr 15:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa66:3\">Isa 66:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer32:34\">Jer 32:34</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek20:7\">Ezek 20:7</a>), and the similarity between the sounds of <em>shomem</em>, “devastation, destruction, desolation,” and <em>shamayim</em> is clear. In December 167&nbsp;BC, Antiochus&nbsp;IV erected an image of Zeus atop the altar of burnt offering in the Temple court and sacrificed unclean animals there. The same phrase (<em>abomination of desolation</em>) is used in <em>1&nbsp;Maccabees</em> 1:54 to describe that altar and its sacrifices. Jesus and multiple New Testament authors anticipated a desolating sacrilege in the future (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt24:15\">Matt 24:15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark13:14\">Mark 13:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke21:20\">Luke 21:20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess2:3-2Thess2:4\">2&nbsp;Thes 2:3–4</a>). After Titus destroyed the Temple in Jerusalem in AD&nbsp;70, the Romans set up their idols in the Temple precinct and made sacrifices to their gods (see Josephus, <em>War</em> 6.6.1). The apostle John later observed that many antichrists had appeared (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1John2:18-1John2:23\">1&nbsp;Jn 2:18–23</a>) and that the spirit of the antichrist was at work in the world (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1John4:3\">1&nbsp;Jn 4:3</a>). •&nbsp;The time of destruction is under God’s control, and the fate decreed for this defiler is certain to come (cp. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan7:11\">Dan 7:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan8:25\">8:25</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan11:45\">11:45</a>). So it is with every ruler who exalts himself against God and seeks to destroy God’s people.</p>",
