(2)&nbsp;A second interpretation sees <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet3:19-1Pet3:20\">3:19–20</a> as describing Christ’s preaching through Noah to people who are now spirits in prison. This interpretation does justice to <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet3:20\">3:20</a> but does not fit well in the discussion of Christ’s death and resurrection (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet3:18\">3:18</a>). (3)&nbsp;In the third interpretation, <em>the spirits in prison</em> are evil spiritual beings. Jewish tradition, based on <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen6:1-Gen6:4\">Gen 6:1–4</a>, held that many angels fell in the time of Noah (see also <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jude1:6\">Jude 1:6</a>; <em>1&nbsp;Enoch</em> 6–10).

    "content": "<p>Babylon was probably symbolic for Rome. Like Rome, Babylon was a great city, the capital of an empire. Babylon held sway over much of the ancient Near East in the 500s&nbsp;BC. As a great city and the capital of the empire that burned Jerusalem and took many captive Israelites back to the city, Babylon was regarded as the power center of a world hostile to God’s people. For this reason, the book of Revelation uses “Babylon” as a metaphor or code word for Rome. Peter probably also used the title in the same way. •&nbsp;Mark<em>,</em> also called John Mark, was another co-worker of the apostle Paul. Mark wrote the Gospel of Mark, which is generally thought to be based on Peter’s teachings.</p>",
