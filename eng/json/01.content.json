    "content": "<p>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth: This statement summarizes the entire creation account (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen1:3-Gen2:3\">1:3–2:3</a>). Already a key question—Who created the world?—is answered (see also <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov8:22-Prov8:31\">Prov 8:22–31</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John1:1-John1:3\">John 1:1–3</a>). Although the modern naturalistic mindset rejects this question and that of creation’s purpose, Genesis affirms God’s role and purpose in creation. •&nbsp;The common name for God (Hebrew ’elohim) emphasizes his grand supremacy. The word ’elohim is plural, but the verbs used with it are usually singular, reflecting the consistent scriptural proclamation of a single, all-powerful God. •&nbsp;created (Hebrew bara’): In the Old Testament, God is always the agent of creation expressed by this verb. It describes the making of something fresh and new—notably the cosmos (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen1:1\">1:1</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen1:21\">21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen2:3\">2:3</a>), humankind (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen1:27\">1:27</a>), the Israelite nation (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa43:1\">Isa 43:1</a>), and the future new creation (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa65:17\">Isa 65:17</a>). •&nbsp;The heavens and the earth are the entire ordered cosmos.</p>",

The concept of the Trinity—one true God who exists eternally in three distinct persons—was revealed at a later stage in redemptive history, making it unlikely that the human author intended that here. Hebrew scholars generally dismiss the plural of majesty view because the grammar does not clearly support it (the plural of majesty has not been demonstrated to be communicated purely through a plural verb). The plural of self-deliberation also lacks evidence; the only clear examples refer to Israel as a corporate unity (e.g., <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam24:14\">2&nbsp;Sam 24:14</a>). God’s speaking to the heavenly court, however, is well-attested in the Old Testament (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen3:22\">Gen 3:22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen11:7\">11:7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs22:19-1Kgs22:22\">1&nbsp;Kgs 22:19–22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job1:6-Job1:12\">Job 1:6–12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job2:1-Job2:6\">2:1–6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job38:7\">38:7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps89:5-Ps89:6\">Ps 89:5–6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa6:1-Isa6:8\">Isa 6:1–8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan10:12-Dan10:13\">Dan 10:12–13</a>). •&nbsp;The descriptors in our image and like us are virtually synonymous in Hebrew.

Adam was probably aware of the serpent’s cunning, having assessed and named all the animals before Eve was created (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen2:19-Gen2:20\">2:19–20</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen2:23\">23</a>). •&nbsp;Did God really say?

Like his ancestor, Lamech took human life and had to live in constant fear of death as a consequence (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen4:23-Gen4:24\">4:23–24</a>). By contrast, Enoch, the seventh from Adam through the lineage of Seth (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen4:25-Gen5:32\">4:25–5:32</a>), lived in a way that pleased God and avoided death altogether (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen5:24\">5:24</a>). (2) Advances in human culture and technology came through Cain’s line (the first city, livestock, shelter, metallurgy, music), but the effects of sin still dominated. No technological advances are mentioned in Seth’s line; instead, people began “to worship the Lord” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen4:26\">4:26</a>) and to find “favor with the Lord” (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen6:8\">6:8</a>).</p>",

This interpretation is prominent in ancient Jewish and Christian literature (e.g., <em>1&nbsp;Enoch</em> 6:1–7:6; Justin Martyr, <em>Apology</em> 2.5) and is apparently supported by the New Testament (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet3:18-1Pet3:20\">1&nbsp;Pet 3:18–20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Pet2:4\">2&nbsp;Pet 2:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jude1:6-Jude1:7\">Jude 1:6–7</a>). Some interpreters do not believe that God would permit angels to procreate with humans and doubt that the above New Testament texts should be read in this way. Another possibility is that <em>sons of God</em> refers to the righteous descendants of Seth, while the beautiful women were female descendants of Cain’s wicked line. This interpretation is in harmony with <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen4:17-Gen5:32\">Gen 4:17–5:32</a> but is weakened by the language of <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen6:1-Gen6:2\">6:1–2</a>, which seems to refer to the daughters of humanity in general, not the daughters of Cain specifically. Others believe that <em>sons of God</em> refers to tyrannical human kings (possibly demon-possessed) who took Lamech’s polygamy (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen4:19\">4:19</a>) to a new height of wickedness by seizing the daughters of the righteous. Language reminiscent of <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen3:6\">3:6</a> (saw .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. took) shows the rebellious nature of this act.</p>",

No mention is made of Sarai’s parentage, perhaps to add suspense to the Abimelech story, which reveals that she was Abram’s half sister (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen20:9-Gen20:12\">20:9–12</a>). Later, the law prohibited such a marriage (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev18:9\">Lev 18:9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev20:17\">20:17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut27:22\">Deut 27:22</a>). •&nbsp;Nahor’s wife was Milcah: Milcah was Haran’s daughter and Nahor’s niece (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen11:29\">Gen 11:29</a>). Her son Bethuel was the father of Rebekah, the wife of Abram’s son Isaac (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen24:10\">24:10</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen24:15\">15</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen24:24\">24</a>). The name Milcah is related to the Hebrew word meaning “queen.” In Akkadian, it is a title of the goddess Ishtar, the moon-god’s daughter. Terah’s name is related to the word for “moon” in Hebrew; his whole family appears to have worshiped Sin, the moon-god (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh24:14\">Josh 24:14</a>).</p>",

God wanted Abraham to sacrifice his own will and surrender it to God, and when he did, God intervened. This passage sets a pattern for all sacrificial worshipers. Like Abraham, true worshipers of God know that everything belongs to God—it all came from God and must therefore be acknowledged as God’s possession. A true worshiper holds nothing back but obediently gives God what he asks, trusting that God will provide for all needs, and then discovering through experience that God always does so.</p>",

The themes are closely related to those found in wisdom books such as Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Daniel. Wisdom literature assures the faithful that God brings good out of evil and joy out of pain—if not in this life, then certainly in the life to come. Though the wicked may prosper for a time, the righteous should hold fast to their integrity because a higher, more enduring principle of life is realized through obedience to God. Everyone who aspires to leadership in God’s plan should observe how wisdom led to Joseph’s success. Christ Jesus embodied the life of wisdom portrayed here as no one else could, for he is the wisdom of God. •&nbsp;Judah is also an important character in the story. He began as irresponsible and mean-spirited as his brothers; but he truly repented, put his life on the line to ransom a child for his father, and received a&nbsp;very important inheritance.</p>",

The certainty of God’s will is the basis for forgiveness and reconciliation with those who do wrong, cause hurt, or bring harm. If people do not believe that God is sovereign, then they will blame others and retaliate. Those who are spiritual will trust that God is at work even through human wickedness (see also <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom8:28-Rom8:30\">Rom 8:28–30</a>).</p>",
