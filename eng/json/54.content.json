The church is positioned between these past and future appearances of Christ. Christ’s first, saving epiphany made possible a new life; his future epiphany will achieve final salvation. Though the present is evil (the “last times,” <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Tim4:1-1Tim4:3\">1&nbsp;Tim 4:1–3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim3:1-2Tim3:9\">2&nbsp;Tim 3:1–9</a>), our anticipation of Christ’s appearance creates accountability for living a godly life in the present. By contrast, the false teachers advocated sinful behaviors because they assumed the resurrection had already occurred (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim2:18\">2&nbsp;Tim 2:18</a>). In response, Paul makes clear that salvation has begun but is not yet complete. The conduct of God’s household requires responsible living in the light of Christ’s past, present, and future saving work (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Tim3:15-1Tim3:16\">1&nbsp;Tim 3:15–16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Titus2:11-Titus2:14\">Titus 2:11–14</a>).</p>",
