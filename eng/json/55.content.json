But it does affirm that God is fully responsible for his word. Scripture is true, reliable, authoritative, permanent, and powerful because it comes from God himself. Its message is coherent, and it is consistent in its testimony about Jesus Christ (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke24:25-Luke24:27\">Luke 24:25–27</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke24:44\">44</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John5:39-John5:40\">John 5:39–40</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts3:24\">Acts 3:24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor15:3-1Cor15:4\">1&nbsp;Cor 15:3–4</a>).
