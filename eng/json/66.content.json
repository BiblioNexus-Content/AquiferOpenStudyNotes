    "content": "<p>This section pictures the willful rejection of God’s continuing call for repentance. The many attempts to silence his witnesses ultimately fail, and God triumphs. •&nbsp;Many attempts have been made to identify the two witnesses of this chapter. Moses and Elijah, who appeared with Jesus at the transfiguration (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt17:3\">Matt 17:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark9:4\">Mark 9:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke9:30\">Luke 9:30</a>), are likely candidates (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev11:6\">Rev 11:6</a>); they represent the law and the prophets. Others have suggested Enoch and Elijah because they did not die (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen5:21-Gen5:24\">Gen 5:21–24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs2:11-2Kgs2:12\">2&nbsp;Kgs 2:11–12</a>). Other possibilities include Peter and Paul, or James and John. More important than their identities is their role of confirming God’s message by the testimony of “two&nbsp;or three witnesses” (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut17:6\">Deut 17:6</a>). God provides a twofold witness to the world about the impending judgment, making it clear that his word is certain to be fulfilled (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut19:15\">Deut 19:15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt18:15-Matt18:16\">Matt 18:15–16</a>).</p>",

The curse contrasts with the statement of blessing on all who read aloud, listen to, and obey the prophecy (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev1:3\">Rev 1:3</a>). At the time Revelation was written, scribes would sometimes alter books to suit their own views. Early Christians quickly developed means of authenticating both messages and messengers (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John21:24\">John 21:24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor16:21\">1&nbsp;Cor 16:21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal6:11\">Gal 6:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Col4:18\">Col 4:18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess3:17\">2&nbsp;Thes 3:17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1John4:1-1John4:3\">1&nbsp;Jn 4:1–3</a>). •&nbsp;Since the time of the early church, the scope and content of the New Testament has been established as the measure of the Christian proclamation. Yet the church continues to be plagued by those who would attempt to reconstruct the borders of Scripture by adding other works that they believe are of equal status with the Bible or by arguing that certain segments of the Bible are unreliable creations of human effort and perception. The genuine church has rejected and will continue to reject efforts to redefine the boundaries of the canon as human and even demonic attempts to alter the basis of the Christian faith.</p>",
