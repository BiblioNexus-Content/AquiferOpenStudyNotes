The fortress of Megiddo stood on a hill in the largest pass through the Carmel range, strategically guarding the Jezreel Valley. The city was situated on the Via Maris, the main highway between Egypt and Mesopotamia. Many armies used this route, and the site became known as a bloody battlefield. It was here, for instance, that Pharaoh Neco, on his way to fight the Assyrians, killed Josiah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs23:29\">2&nbsp;Kgs 23:29</a>). Armageddon thus became a symbolic term epitomizing the final conflict between God and the forces of evil.</p>",

    "content": "<p>I solemnly declare: John issues an oath to protect the integrity of the book of Revelation. He declares a curse upon anyone who alters the contents of the book or its message (cp. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut4:2\">Deut 4:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut12:32\">12:32</a>). The curse contrasts with the statement of blessing on all who read aloud, listen to, and obey the prophecy (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev1:3\">Rev 1:3</a>). At the time Revelation was written, scribes would sometimes alter books to suit their own views. Early Christians quickly developed means of authenticating both messages and messengers (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John21:24\">John 21:24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor16:21\">1&nbsp;Cor 16:21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal6:11\">Gal 6:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Col4:18\">Col 4:18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess3:17\">2&nbsp;Thes 3:17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1John4:1-1John4:3\">1&nbsp;Jn 4:1–3</a>). •&nbsp;Since the time of the early church, the scope and content of the New Testament has been established as the measure of the Christian proclamation. Yet the church continues to be plagued by those who would attempt to reconstruct the borders of Scripture by adding other works that they believe are of equal status with the Bible or by arguing that certain segments of the Bible are unreliable creations of human effort and perception. The genuine church has rejected and will continue to reject efforts to redefine the boundaries of the canon as human and even demonic attempts to alter the basis of the Christian faith.</p>",
