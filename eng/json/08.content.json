The scribe believed <em>you buy</em> was the original text, suggesting an error in the main text. Some think <em>I buy</em> is the original, indicating Boaz and Ruth&apos;s marriage was already planned (see <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"24979\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleStudyNotes\">study note on Judges 3:11</span>). However, most translators believe <em>you buy</em> is original because: </p><ol><li><p>The scribe thought <em>you buy</em> was correct</p></li><li><p>Most ancient translations of Ruth which are older than our Hebrew copies, also read <em>you buy</em></p></li><li><p>An earlier scribe might have mistakenly used <em>I have acquired</em> from <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ruth4:10\">Ruth 4:10</a> instead of <em>you buy</em> </p></li></ol><p>This ensures Ruth can have children to continue her husband&apos;s name and keep the land in the family, drawing from <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut25:7\">Deuteronomy 25:7</a>. Boaz linked the duties of a family redeemer (see study notes <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"24971\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleStudyNotes\">Ruth 2:20</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"19448\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleStudyNotes\">Leviticus 25:25</span>) with those of a brother-in-law (Latin &quot;<em>levir</em>&quot;) to provide an heir for a deceased brother (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut25:5-Deut25:10\">Deuteronomy 25:5–10</a> for levirate marriage; compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen38:1-Gen38:30\">Genesis 38</a>). There is no exact precedent for Boaz&apos;s legal action. The duty of the &quot;<em>levir</em>&quot; in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut25:5-Deut25:10\">Deuteronomy 25:5–10</a> did not apply here, as neither Boaz nor the other kinsman was Elimelech’s brother, and Ruth was not Elimelech’s widow. Boaz used the spirit of the law about the <em>go’el</em> (family redeemer) to create a moral, if not legal, duty to act as &quot;<em>levir</em>&quot; and provide an heir to inherit the land (see study note on <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"19448\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleStudyNotes\">Leviticus 25:25</span>). Land ownership and providing an heir were closely linked in ancient Israel (compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num27:1-Num27:11\">Numbers 27:1–11)</a>. Since Naomi was too old to have children, Ruth, Elimelech’s son&apos;s widow, would be the mother of such an heir. This move surprised the other kinsman (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ruth4:6\">Ruth 4:6</a>), but Boaz&apos;s argument, though perhaps new, was accepted as valid.</p>",
