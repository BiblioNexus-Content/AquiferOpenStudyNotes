In this case, some anti-Paul missionaries arrived in Corinth and started a strong campaign against the apostolic message of good news (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor11:4\">11:4</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor11:13-2Cor11:15\">13–15</a>). They claimed Paul was not a true apostle or even a true Christian (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor10:7\">10:7</a>) and that he had no right to bring the gospel message to Corinth, as it was their territory (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor10:15-2Cor10:16\">10:15–16</a>). They brought a foreign message (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor11:4\">11:4</a>) and had a domineering attitude. In short, they were doing Satan’s work (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor11:13-2Cor11:15\">11:13–15</a>). Paul, worried about this new situation, reasserts his apostolic authority and writes in a way he dislikes (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor11:1\">11:1</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor11:16-2Cor11:17\">16–17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor12:1\">12:1</a>) by boasting about his weaknesses and trials. Paul’s apostolic authority is genuine and powerful, yet it is guided by the love shown by the crucified Jesus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor10:1\">10:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor13:4-2Cor13:10\">13:4–10</a>).</p></li></ol></li></ul>",
