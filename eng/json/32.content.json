In making this judgment, they oppose themselves to one of the book’s main theological themes—that God is supremely sovereign over nature. If God exists, and he created and controls nature (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jonah1:9\">1:9</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jonah1:16\">16</a>; see also <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen1:21\">Gen 1:21</a>), a miraculous event of this magnitude is not unfathomable. The book presents the fish episode as a historical event. •&nbsp;No indication is given as to the species of the fish, nor is identifying a species crucial to validating the significance of the account. Granted God’s creative power, the fish that swallowed Jonah might well have been specially formed and appointed by the Lord for this particular event. If God exists and can work miracles, Jonah’s need for oxygen and protection from digestive processes poses no problem (cp. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan3:14-Dan3:27\">Dan 3:14–27</a>). On the other hand, certain species are large enough to have served the purpose (e.g., the whale shark), and similar incidents have been recorded in modern times. •&nbsp;Jesus later referred to Jonah’s stay in the belly of the fish for three days and three nights in predicting the duration of his time in the grave (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt12:39-Matt12:41\">Matt 12:39–41</a>). •&nbsp;Arranged for is the first of four occurrences of the same Hebrew word in the book (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jonah4:6\">Jon 4:6</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jonah4:7\">7</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jonah4:8\">8</a>).
