    "content": "<ul><li><p><em>Blessed</em>: The Hebrew term (<em>’ashrey</em>) appears twenty-six times in Psalms. While some translations use “blessed,” a different term (<em>barak</em>) is used for blessings (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps5:12\">Psalms 5:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps45:2\">45:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps107:38\">107:38</a>). </p></li><li><p>The godly avoid living under the influence of sinners. Those who do not fear the Lord are wicked (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps36:1\">Psalm 36:1</a>). They oppose those who love God, do right, and the poor and oppressed (see<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps10:2-Ps10:13\"> 10:2–13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps37:14\">37:14</a>). The wicked might seem devoted to God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps50:16\">50:16</a>). Sometimes they enjoy success, but it does not last long (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps37:35\">37:35</a>). They will face sadness and ruin when they must deal with the results of their bad actions (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps1:4-Ps1:6\">1:4–6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps9:16\">9:16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps32:10\">32:10</a>). </p></li><li><p>People who turn away from God&apos;s path and rebel against him are sinners (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps25:8\">Psalms 25:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps78:17\">78:17</a>). They commit serious crimes like adultery (being unfaithful to their spouse) and murder (compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps51:1-Ps51:19\">Psalm 51</a>). </p></li><li><p><em>sit in the seat of</em>: This expression describes a person who is controlled by sin (compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps1:2\">Psalm 1:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps26:3-Ps26:7\">26:3–7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut6:7\">Deuteronomy 6:7</a>). </p></li><li><p>Mockers are people who disrespect and reject God&apos;s wisdom. Mockers hate the Lord and insult anyone who tries to correct them (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov9:7-Prov9:8\">Proverbs 9:7–8</a>). They seek only the “wisdom” that justifies their actions. These bold people have little respect for God, his plans, or his followers (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps86:14\">Psalms 86:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps119:51\">119:51</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps119:69\">69</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps119:78\">78</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps119:85\">85</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps119:122\">122</a>). These three terms (wicked, sinners, mockers) describe all kinds of people who do not live in a way that pleases God.</p></li></ul>",

    "content": "<p>This wisdom psalm sets the tone for the whole Psalter. The psalmist strongly contrasts the happiness of the godly with the condemnation of the wicked; in the end, the way of wisdom will triumph. This idealization of the godly person (as in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps8:1-Ps8:9\">Ps 8</a>) highlights the Lord’s expectations of his people and especially of the coming Messiah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps2:1-Ps2:12\">Ps 2</a>). The people of Israel did not live up to this ideal, and neither did the kings of David’s dynasty. Not even the best of them could bring in the triumph of righteousness described in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps1:1-Ps1:6\">Psalms 1</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps2:1-Ps2:12\">2</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps72:1-Ps72:20\">and 72</a>. In the New Testament, the apostles’ use of the Psalter to describe the life and ministry of Jesus the Messiah confirms that Jesus alone fulfills the ideal of the godly person presented in the psalms. Only Jesus could please God and secure redemption, happiness, and peace. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps1:1-Ps1:6\">Psalm 1</a> introduces the hopeful anticipation of the final hallelujah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps150:1-Ps150:6\">Ps 150</a>), when the Lord will remove all evil from his creation and prosper his children.</p>",

The placement of <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps110:1-Ps110:7\">Ps 110</a> in Book Five reaffirms the future of the dynasty: David’s descendant must conform to God’s standard of integrity (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps101:1-Ps101:8\">Ps 101</a>). His ministry will be transformed as he serves under God’s kingship (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps93:1-Ps100:5\">Pss 93–100</a>). •&nbsp;You are a priest forever: The role of God’s messianic ruler changes. The priestly kingship of David and his descendants extended to serving as patrons of the Temple. David had the Ark brought to Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam6:15\">2&nbsp;Sam 6:15</a>) and arranged for the Temple service (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr6:31-1Chr6:48\">1&nbsp;Chr 6:31–48</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr15:11-1Chr15:26\">15:11–26</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr16:4-1Chr16:42\">16:4–42</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr23:4-1Chr23:32\">23:4–32</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr25:1\">25:1</a>).
