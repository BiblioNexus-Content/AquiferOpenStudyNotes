The Gospel opens with its central affirmation, that Jesus Christ, the Word (Greek logos), not only revealed God but was God<em>.</em> In Greek thought, the logos was the rational principle guiding the universe and making life coherent. For Jewish people, the logos was the word of the Lord, an expression of God’s wisdom and creative power. By Jesus’ time, the logos was viewed as coming from God and having his personality (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps33:6\">Ps 33:6</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps33:9\">9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov8:22-Prov8:31\">Prov 8:22–31</a>); John affirmed this understanding (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John1:14\">John 1:14</a>).</p>",

From this need grew a considerable industry for selling animals and exchanging money, but this business was being conducted in the Temple.

This put Jesus at odds with the Temple leadership. •&nbsp;The synoptic Gospels place the clearing of the Temple near the end of Jesus’ ministry (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt21:12-Matt21:13\">Matt 21:12–13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark11:15-Mark11:17\">Mark 11:15–17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke19:45-Luke19:46\">Luke 19:45–46</a>). John might have placed his account of the event here to emphasize a connection with the miracle that transformed the water in purification jars into wine (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John2:1-John2:11\">John 2:1–11</a>). The Temple and the stone jars were both instruments of purification in Judaism. Stone jars filled with water for ritual washing now contained Jesus’ wine, and a stone Temple dedicated to sacrificial purification would be replaced by Christ himself (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John2:19-John2:21\">2:19–21</a>). Another view is that Jesus cleared the Temple at the beginning and again at the end of his ministry.</p>",

Two hundred years before Christ, Greek soldiers captured and pillaged the Jerusalem Temple, took its treasures and artifacts, and made it unusable for worship. In the winter of 165–164 BC, a Jewish army led by Judas Maccabeus reclaimed the Temple and rededicated it to the Lord. The Festival of Hanukkah (“dedication”) marked this dedication (see <em>1 Maccabees</em> 3–4; <em>2 Maccabees</em> 8:1–10:8). During the festival, priests examined their commitment to service, using <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek34:1-Ezek34:31\">Ezek 34</a> as their principal text for reflection (also <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer23:1-Jer23:4\">Jer 23:1–4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer25:32-Jer25:38\">25:32–38</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Zech11:1-Zech11:17\">Zech 11</a>). At this Hanukkah celebration, Jesus used the shepherd theme from <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek34:1-Ezek34:31\">Ezek 34</a> to distinguish between himself as the good shepherd (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John10:11\">John 10:11</a>) and Israel’s current religious leaders as bad shepherds (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John10:10\">10:10</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John10:12-John10:13\">12–13</a>).</p>",

It is not a story written from hearsay or speculation, but from the remembrance of a man who spent life-changing years with Jesus and recalled, with the help of the Holy Spirit (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John14:26\">14:26</a>), what Jesus said and did. •&nbsp;we know: This account of the life of Christ was not speculation or weak reminiscence. Rather, it was based on the confident knowledge of reliable eyewitness accounts.</p>",
