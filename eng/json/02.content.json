It is also natural for a young woman to feel sorry for a crying baby. The combination of factors may account for her rescuing the child, though she recognized that he was Hebrew (Hebrews and Egyptians practiced circumcision differently).</p>",

By naming the child Moses (meaning “to give birth”), the princess was perhaps saying that the Nile, revered as a source of life, had given birth to the baby.

At the outset of the Exodus, God was making it plain that he is absolutely “other” than his creation, a reality that cannot be overlooked in a proper divine-human relationship. The word holy occurs only a few times in the Bible prior to <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod3:5\">Exod 3:5</a>. It now becomes the central descriptor of God in the Old Testament. In other Semitic languages, the same root occurs infrequently. It does not describe a moral quality in these other languages but simply what is “other than” human. The pagan gods, for instance, were “holy” only in the sense of being “other”—they did everything humans do, good and evil, but on a larger scale. In the Bible, by contrast, moral perfection is a central idea of the term <em>holy.</em> The one true God is the only being in the universe who truly stands apart from this world and is worthy of being called “holy” in this general sense. The true God is perfectly consistent and moral in his character. Here, at the burning bush, God revealed his otherness. Later at Sinai, he revealed his moral character in his requirements for those who would be his covenant partners (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod19:6\">Exod 19:6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod20:1-Exod23:33\">20:1–23:33</a>; see also <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev11:45\">Lev 11:45</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet1:13-1Pet1:16\">1&nbsp;Pet 1:13–16</a>).</p>",

In oral reading, the Hebrew reader would pronounce <em>’adonay,</em> even though the written text is <em>YHWH.</em> We do not know the pronunciation of the divine name. The widely used <em>Yahweh</em> is an informed guess. The English word “Jehovah” is an artificial term made by combining the vowels of ’adonay with the consonants Y-H-W-H. In the NLT, this name is usually translated “Lord” (with small capitals), but it is transliterated “Yahweh” in the few instances, like this verse, where a point is made about the name itself.

El-Shaddai: Here the NLT transliterates the divine names <em>Yahweh</em> and <em>El-Shaddai</em> because God was emphasizing that he was now using a different name than the name by which he was known to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. To assist the English reader, the translators have also supplied the English terms usually used for these Hebrew terms: “the Lord” and “God Almighty.” •&nbsp;I did not reveal my name, Yahweh, to them: The name Yahweh in fact appears frequently in Genesis (translated “the Lord”). Two solutions are possible: (1)&nbsp;The name Yahweh was not known to the patriarchs, but Moses, the author of Genesis, was inspired to insert that name in those places in Genesis where God’s grace and his nature as covenant-keeper were apparent.&nbsp;While the patriarchs might have known the name Yahweh, it is possible that they had never seen God’s nature displayed as it was in the Exodus and the Sinai covenant. In Hebrew, a person’s name has a broader significance than it does in English. People’s names were intended to reflect their character and nature, not just serve as a label (see, e.g., <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps8:1\">Pss 8:1</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps8:9\">9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps148:13\">148:13</a>). Here reveal is a Hebrew word often translated “to know,” which implies intimate knowledge and experience. In this case, the patriarchs knew God’s name, but they did not know and experience his nature fully as he revealed himself in the Exodus.</p>",

Unlike pagan gods, whose only purpose is personal power, and who are in constant conflict among themselves, the true God has a single, overarching purpose: He wants his creation to find its fulfillment in proper relation to him. Although he enacts that purpose in ever-expanding displays of creativity, the new activities are always consistent with what he has already revealed of himself. Moses and Aaron did not suddenly appear out of the unknown, but were an integral part of that same people to whom God first revealed himself and through whom he was about to give an even grander revelation. The genealogies of Jesus have a similar purpose (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt1:1-Matt1:16\">Matt 1:1–16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke3:23-Luke3:38\">Luke 3:23–38</a>).</p>",

(2)&nbsp;A historical preamble set out the circumstances that had led to the offer of a treaty (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod20:2\">20:2</a>). (3)&nbsp;Stipulations, the terms upon which the two parties were to agree, typically included the king’s offer of protection from enemies and care during emergency, while the people would agree to behave in conformity to the preferences of that king. Exodus includes a brief setting forth of the terms of the covenant (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod20:3-Exod20:17\">20:3–17</a>) followed by expanded terms (chs <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod21:1-Exod23:33\">21–23</a>).

(5)&nbsp;The gods were called upon to witness the agreement (in Exodus, historical markers are substituted for the gods, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod24:4\">24:4</a>). (6)&nbsp;The blessings and curses were stated that would follow upon obedience or disobedience to the covenant (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod23:20-Exod23:33\">23:20–33</a>). Utilizing the political form of the covenant, God invited his people into a formal relationship with himself as king while avoiding the pagan overtones that contaminated religious forms of the time.

This last section of Exodus completes the revelation of God necessary for the people of Israel to come out of the theological darkness that had held them in bondage. This final section includes instructions for building the Tabernacle (chs <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod25:1-Exod31:18\">25–31</a>), the story of the gold calf (a wrong attempt to secure God’s presence, chs <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod32:1-Exod34:35\">32–34</a>), and the report of building the Tabernacle (the proper way to secure God’s presence, chs <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod35:1-Exod40:38\">35–40</a>). God’s ultimate goal in delivering the people from bondage was to share his presence with them. Because of his holiness, that presence could only be experienced in his way, not through the pagan way of human manipulation. The construction of the Tabernacle is reported here, even though some of the instructions in Leviticus were actually given before this event (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod40:1-Exod40:2\">40:1–2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev25:1\">Lev 25:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev27:34\">27:34</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num7:1\">Num 7:1</a>).
