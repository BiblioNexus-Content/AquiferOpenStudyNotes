Yet, the vow mentioned here was probably a promise made to God when asking for a specific answer to prayer (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen28:20-Gen28:22\">Genesis 28:20–22</a>). During that time, some pagan religions sacrificed infants to their gods, but God prohibited this practice (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev18:21\">Leviticus 18:21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev20:2-Lev20:5\">20:2–5</a>; compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen22:12-Gen22:13\">Genesis 22:12–13</a>). </p><p>Therefore, to <em>make special vow</em> <em>to the Lord</em> meant providing service, not sacrificing a life. Whether an individual made this vow or by someone on their behalf, it required payment to the sanctuary, probably for the person&apos;s expenses during their service.
