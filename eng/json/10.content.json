By contrast, the Chronicler, who never mentioned David’s sins against Bathsheba and Uriah, placed Uriah’s name inconspicuously in the middle of the list of David’s mighty men (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr11:10-1Chr11:47\">1&nbsp;Chr 11:10–47</a>). This author not only described the sins (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam11:1-2Sam11:27\">2&nbsp;Sam 11:1–27</a>) but puts emphasis on Uriah’s name by placing it at the end of this list. Uriah was no ordinary conscript but a loyal member of David’s elite guard, which makes David’s treachery against him all the worse. •&nbsp;There were thirty-seven in all: Only thirty-six names are mentioned, assuming that “Shammah .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. from Harar” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam23:11\">23:11</a>) is different from “Shammah from Harod” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam23:25\">23:25</a>), and that “Benaiah son of Jehoiada” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam23:20\">23:20</a>) is different from “Benaiah from Pirathon” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam23:30\">23:30</a>).
