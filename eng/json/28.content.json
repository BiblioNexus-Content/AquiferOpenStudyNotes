    "content": "<p>a prostitute: Some have found it impossible to believe that God would command a prophet to marry a prostitute. As a result, there is a long tradition of interpreting this passage symbolically. Many in the early church believed that the marriage did not actually take place. They thought that this passage was an allegory in which Hosea represented the Lord and Gomer represented Israel. Today, most interpreters regard the marriage as a real one, but they differ in their ideas about Gomer’s occupation prior to the marriage. Some suggest that Gomer was an ordinary prostitute, while others suggest that she was one of the sacred prostitutes involved in Canaanite fertility worship. Another possibility is that Gomer was a young woman who had not previously participated in illicit sexual activity, but whom God knew to be predisposed toward adultery and prostitution.</p>",

Knowing God is much more than simply knowing facts about God (see “<span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"203269\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleStudyNotesThemes\">Knowing God</span>” Theme Note). An intimate personal relationship with God is characterized by complete trust and integrity. Sacrifice still had a proper place in Israelite religion, but only when it was offered by a people who truly knew and loved God (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa1:10-Isa1:17\">Isa 1:10–17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Amos5:21-Amos5:24\">Amos 5:21–24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mic6:6-Mic6:8\">Mic 6:6–8</a>).</p>",
